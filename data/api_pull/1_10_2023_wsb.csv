"Pentagon to train Ukraine on Patriot missile system in Oklahoma

https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/01/10/ukraine-patriot-missile-fort-sill-oklahoma/

The Pentagon is planning to bring Ukrainian troops to the United States for training on the Patriot missile defense system, a U.S. official with direct knowledge of the development said Tuesday.
The training will occur at Fort Sill, which spans about 145 square miles southwest of Oklahoma City, and could begin as soon as this month, the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the plan ahead of a formal announcement. The base is home to both basic Patriot missile defense training and field artillery training for U.S. troops.
The move follows President Biden‚Äôs decision last month to approve sending a Patriot missile defense system to Ukraine to bolster Kyiv‚Äôs defenses against an onslaught of Russian missiles. Germany last week announced that it, too, would send a Patriot battery to Ukraine.
Pentagon officials declined Tuesday morning to discuss the plan. But a senior Pentagon official, Laura Cooper, said last week that training will begin in January, and take several months.
‚ÄúPatriot is not an immediate-term capability,‚Äù said Cooper, a deputy assistant secretary of defense. ‚ÄúBut we will start that training very soon.‚Äù
A Pentagon spokesman, Brig. Gen. Patrick Ryder, said last week that details were still being worked out.
‚ÄúI can tell you that we‚Äôre exploring a variety of options to include potential training here in the U.S., overseas, or a combination of both,‚Äù he said.","The Pentagon is going to train Ukrainian troops on our missile defense system, what's the play?",1,self.wallstreetbets,108e12m,propheticguy,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/108e12m/the_pentagon_is_going_to_train_ukrainian_troops/,1673368213

" The inflation is easing and the fed has appropriately taken the foot off the accelerator so to speak with an idea of throttling down the rate hikes with a stated goal of assessing the impact.  
(We can not achieve a soft landing without throttling down the rate hikes)  
So , imo , the bearish thesis that was so prevalent in year 2022 will give way to reality in Cy2023 and that reality is that the mission of a soft landing has all the appearances of working as was planned by the fed.

"Jerome Powell again told us the importance of the central bank's independence. 

Think of it as giving the Fed a ""long leash"" to make important monetary policy decisions, free from short-term political pressures. Powell emphasizes that this independence is crucial to achieving the Fed's mandate of maximum employment and price stability, much like how a farmer needs to give his cows a long leash so they can graze properly.

He also stresses the importance of transparency, allowing the public and their representatives to ""look over the Fed's shoulder"" and understand the reasoning behind its decisions. Just like how a chef needs to be transparent with their ingredients, the Fed needs to be transparent about its ""recipe"" for monetary policy.

Powell also reminds us to not let the Fed ""chase after every shiny object"", or try to tackle societal issues beyond its statutory goals and mandate. In other words, the Fed should not ""spread itself too thin"".

In summary, Powell emphasizes the importance of independence, transparency, and focus in the Fed's actions and doesn't touch on market specifics such as cutting or halting rates. It mostly focuses on the importance of the Fed's independence.

"Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Tuesday stressed the need for the central bank to be free of political influence while it tackles persistently high inflation.

In a speech delivered to Sweden‚Äôs Riksbank, Powell noted that stabilizing prices requires making tough decisions that can be unpopular politically.

‚ÄúPrice stability is the bedrock of a healthy economy and provides the public with immeasurable benefits over time. But restoring price stability when inflation is high can require measures that are not popular in the short term as we raise interest rates to slow the economy,‚Äù the chair said in prepared remarks.

‚ÄúThe absence of direct political control over our decisions allows us to take these necessary measures without considering short-term political factors,‚Äù he added.

Powell‚Äôs remarks came at a forum to discuss central bank independence, and were to be followed by a question-and-answer session.

The speech did not contain any direct clues about where policy is ahead for a Fed that raised interest rates seven times in 2022, for a total of 4.25 percentage points, and has indicated that more increases likely are on the way this year.

While criticism of Fed actions by elected leaders is often done in quieter tones, the Powell Fed has faced vocal opposition from both sides of the political aisle.

Former President Donald Trump ripped the central bank when it was raising rates during his administration, while progressive leaders such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) have criticized the current round of hikes. President Joe Biden has largely resisted commenting on Fed moves while noting that it is primarily the central bank‚Äôs responsibility to tackle inflation.

Powell has repeatedly stressed that political factors have not weighed on his actions.

In another part of Tuesday‚Äôs speech, he addressed calls from some lawmakers for the Fed to use its regulatory powers to address climate change. Powell noted that the Fed should ‚Äústick to our knitting and not wander off to pursue perceived social benefits that are not tightly linked to our statutory goals and authorities.‚Äù

While the Fed has asked big banks to examine their financial readiness in case of major climate-related events such as hurricanes and floods, Powell said that‚Äôs as far as it should go.

‚ÄúDecisions about policies to directly address climate change should be made by the elected branches of government and thus reflect the public‚Äôs will as expressed through elections,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut without explicit congressional legislation, it would be inappropriate for us to use our monetary policy or supervisory tools to promote a greener economy or to achieve other climate-based goals. We are not, and will not be, a ‚Äòclimate policymaker.‚Äô‚Äù

The Fed this year will, however, launch a pilot program that calls for the nation‚Äôs six biggest banks to take part in a ‚Äúscenario analysis‚Äù aimed at testing institutions‚Äô stability in the event of major climate events.

The exercise will take place apart from the so-called stress tests that the Fed uses to test how banks would fare under hypothetical economic downturns. Participating institutions are Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo.

"U.S. equities could face a sharper-than-expected selloff in 2023 from a recession shock that pushes stocks down another 22% from the current levels, according to Morgan Stanley‚Äôs Michael Wilson.

The chief equity strategist, who correctly predicted the 2022 stock-market selloff, which saw all three major indexes cement their worst annual losses since 2008, suggested on Monday that the S&amp;P 500 SPX, -0.08% could find a bottom around 3,000 points by the end of 2023. The index was trading around 3,919 at last check, according to FactSet.

Market consensus currently suggests the U.S. economy will experience a mild recession starting in the first half of 2023, followed by a recovery in the second half as the Federal Reserve is expected to stop its rate hikes and possibly cut rates in response to the worsening economic conditions.

However, Morgan Stanley‚Äôs strategists led by Wilson said that the Equity Risk Premium (ERP) for stocks, or excess returns investors could receive for holding stocks over risk-free assets, remains ‚Äúway too low given the high earnings risk,‚Äù while corporate earnings forecasts for 2023 are ‚Äúmaterially too high.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen a recession arrives, the ERP always rises significantly from whatever level you are starting at. In other words, if you think a mild recession is coming, you cannot assume the market has priced it given the ERP is at its lowest level since the run up to the Great Financial Crisis in 2008,‚Äù strategists said.

Morgan Stanley‚Äôs 2023 base case forecast for S&amp;P 500 earnings per share (EPS) of $195, while their bear case forecast is $180. EPS refers to net income divided by the number of shares outstanding, and could indicate how much money a company makes for each share of stock. However, most of the bank‚Äôs clients are in the camp that the S&amp;P 500 EPS won‚Äôt be as bad as its equity strategists think, with the team pegging the average client estimating a ratio around $210 to $215.¬†

‚ÄúFalling demand from higher interest rates and higher prices and payback from the pull-forward during COVID is happening just as supply is catching up to these formerly well-above trend levels of consumption,‚Äù Wilson said in the note. ‚ÄúThat combination has already caught many companies off guard who are unable to reverse the rising costs fast enough. The result has been disappointing margins relative to expectations, and we don‚Äôt think that reset is near completion.‚Äù

That is why a 3,500-3,600 S&amp;P 500 range is not consistent with the consensus view for a mild recession, said Wilson and his team. ‚ÄúThe consensus might be right directionally, but wrong in terms of magnitude‚Ä¶ We think it‚Äôs in the magnitude of the move lower led by much weaker earnings and a Fed committed to fighting inflation, making 3,900 an easy sale.‚Äù¬†

Wilson, one of Wall Street‚Äôs most vocal bears, isn‚Äôt alone in his view that stock-market investors may see even worse declines this year on the back of earnings expectations that may be too optimistic.

Michael Kantrowitz at Piper Sandler &amp; Co. said in a CNBC interview last week that he expects the benchmark index to fall to about 3,225 by the end of this yea, or about a 16% slump from current levels.¬†

"Coinbase Global said that it would eliminate around 20% of its staff and enact broad cost cuts, the latest sign of pain in the cryptocurrency industry.

Chief Executive Brian Armstrong said that crypto exchange Coinbase will reduce operating expenses by 25% from the previous quarter, including laying off about 950 people. At the end of September, the company had around 4,700 employees.

The collapse of rival exchange FTX has kickstarted a fresh round of layoffs across the industry. Crypto lender Genesis¬†eliminated about one-third of its staff¬†last week, and crypto exchange Huobi said it plans to lay off¬†about one-fifth of its staff. Digital-asset companies,¬†including Coinbase, laid off employees last summer after the collapse of two sister cryptocurrencies and a crypto hedge fund shattered the values of coins.

"**Interesting tickers on the move:** 

Trading Thesis: Tracking the float along with daily volume along with company financials helps to narrow down moving tickers. Fundamental and technical analysis is often used to find growth tickers and information about them. Fundamental analysis looks to see whether an investment is overvalued or undervalued based on underlying economic conditions, as well as the finances of the company or other organization that issued a stock or bond. Technical analysis instead looks at patterns in the price of an investment to predict future movements in that investment‚Äôs price.

"Hello everybody

A littlebit about me first, I'm a 22 year old young man who got into this whole thing about 3 years ago. I started by learning fundamentals and reading about price action and the different kind of patterns... ou guys know what I'm talking about.

I started with demotrading the many different strategies there are on youtube and forums like rsi divergences, macd cross indications, bollingerband pullbacks, bla bla bla.....

none of them really worked and I didn't know why they would, should, wouldn't or shouldn't work.

I bought many different subscriptions (yes, I did fall into these ""scams"" out of frustration) on discord, patreon and whetever there exists. I hoped that I get to learn a little something from a little somebody who brags about their massive gains on social media like youtube, tiktok or instagram only to find out that they are simply gambling without knowing anything at all. Sure, sometimes they hit a few big trades but those got outweighed by the many losses and blown accounts on their trackrecord. So I came to the conclusion that I would get the same results (or even better) by simply flipping a coin and doing what it says.

So I started looking at seminars from mark whalberg (rip to the guy) and found out, nobody actuall knows sh*t! Every single retailer out there who trades their strategy doesn't know why they trade what they trade. It's only because on a long enough timeframe the mathematical probabilistc outcome of this strategy says that you will be profitable percentage wise.

My conclusion: I surrender. Not trading!, but finding the holy somebody who can explain the markets to me.

"Achieving your trading goals is essential for long-term success in the stock market. One of the best ways to achieve these goals is by keeping a trading journal. A trading journal is a record of your trades, including details such as the trade setup, entry and exit points, and the reasoning behind the trade. By keeping a journal, you can track your performance, identify your strengths and weaknesses, and improve your overall trading strategy.

A trading journal can help you set and track progress towards your trading goals. By analyzing your trades over time, you can identify patterns in your trading that lead to success and adjust your strategy accordingly. A trading journal also provides a way to reflect on your performance and stay accountable to your goals. Additionally, by tracking your performance with a trading journal you can also fine-tune your risk management plan, to avoid overtrading or undertrading.

In conclusion, keeping a trading journal is an essential tool for any trader looking to achieve their trading goals.

"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/09/goldman-sachs-job-cuts-up-to-3200-employees-laid-off-this-week-.html

Goldman Sachs

is laying off fewer employees than feared, but the cut is still a deep one.

The global investment bank is letting go of as many as 3,200 employees starting Wednesday, according to a person with knowledge of the firm‚Äôs plans.

That amounts to 6.5% of the 49,100 employees Goldman had in October, which is below the 8% reported last month as the upper end of possible cuts.

The final figure, reported earlier by Bloomberg, is a result of internal discussions between business heads and top management over the last month, said the person, who declined to be identified speaking about personnel decisions.

Goldman CEO David Solomon kicked off Wall Street‚Äôs layoff season in September and then opted to enact the industry‚Äôs deepest cuts so far. Bank employee levels swelled over the last two years in response to a boom in deals and trading activity, but the good times didn‚Äôt last: IPO issuance plunged 94% last year because of suddenly inhospitable markets, according to SIFMA data.

Now, with concerns that the economy will slow further this year, Goldman is pulling back on head count in case stock and bond issuance and mergers don‚Äôt rebound. Solomon is also scaling back his ambitions in consumer banking, resulting in part of the layoffs.

Other investment banks are adopting a ‚Äúwait and see‚Äù attitude in the coming weeks. If revenues are tracking below estimates in February and March, the industry could cut more workers, said a person with knowledge of a leading Wall Street firm‚Äôs internal processes.

‚ÄúIf things haven‚Äôt gotten better in the first quarter, we‚Äôll have more changes,‚Äù said compensation consultant Alan Johnson. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt have these expensive people sitting around with nothing to do.‚Äù

Goldman‚Äôs move follows smaller cuts from Morgan Stanley, Citigroup
and Barclays in recent months. Beleaguered Credit Suisse

, which is in the midst of a restructuring, has said it would cut 2,700 employees in the last three months of 2022 and aims to remove a total of 9,000 positions by 2025.

Meanwhile, Goldman is still moving forward with plans to hire junior bankers and in other areas as needed, the source said.","Goldman Sachs is cutting up to 3,200 employees this week as Wall Street girds for tough year",1,self.wallstreetbets,10869l7,Guilty-Ham,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/10869l7/goldman_sachs_is_cutting_up_to_3200_employees/,1673345366

"The last thing the U.S. government wants to see has happened. Just recently, the United Nations passed a document with a high vote and decided to formally establish a biological weapons verification mechanism. We don't need to say more about who it is aimed at. This time, only one country in the world voted against it, that is, the United States, and even its hardcore allies voted for it.

Up to now, it has been three years since the COVID-19 outbreak. In the past three years, the world economy has suffered heavy losses. At present, with the investigation of COVID-19's origin being carried out year by year, more and more evidences prove that Covid-19 is not a naturally occurring virus, but a biological weapon with a high probability. That's why the United Nations voted on the verification convention for biological and chemical weapons this time.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w20a12kmm6ba1.png?width=819&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=736a872690e6cbfcece96b364fe55744e2c6ecd3

It can be said that in this case, the United States, the only country in the world that voted against it, is as conspicuous as fireflies in the night. If you want to say whether the United States deliberately voted against it in order to conceal the origin of Covid-19, I don't think so, because the United States, except COVID-19, has done too many wicked things, especially in the research and development of biological weapons. Japanese are not as wicked as Americans.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bwr0d46om6ba1.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=0fb73cf77b871600cc26c1080a784a9d8f254a56

The most famous example is that after the end of World War II, in order to detect the country's biological and chemical weapons defense capabilities, decided to test the threat of biological and chemical weapons themselves. At the same time, in order to achieve the most realistic effect, the American experiments were conducted in real American cities and on thousands of ordinary Americans! They sent a cruise ship with the virus into San Francisco, and it took only one day to infect all the residents of the city. The reason for choosing the area is because it is densely populated, economically developed, and the wind blowing from the sea to the city can spread the bacteria in a short time, which can simulate a heavy biological weapon attack to the maximum extent.

During the week, the U.S. military kept spraying the virus, from the length of spraying, temperature, wind direction, wind speed, air humidity, as well as infected with this bacteria soil, water bodies, and even crowds were recorded in relation to this experiment, due to the U.S. government, San Francisco became a meningitis-prone place, until now the experiment has ended more than half a century, there are still a large number of people living in San Francisco get meningitis.

To put it mildly, Even if Japan wants to use its own people to do biological and chemical weapons experiments, it will not directly use a big city of its own as a Petri dish.

It is understood that U.S. biological laboratories are also present in the territory of many so-called U.S. allied countries, and there are already 26 U.S.-recognized biological laboratories in Ukraine alone, which is in the midst of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. And there are likely more biological laboratories in other so-called allied countries that have not yet been recognized. There has been no official U.S. recognition of this dangerous behavior.

America's behavior has become a global security risk, even as dangerous as Japan's nuclear wastewater discharge, which is destroying the future of mankind. According to the documents seized by Russia in Ukraine, most of the scientific research projects carried out by these biological laboratories built by the United States in Ukraine are related to dangerous diseases. Even up to now, so-called biologists in the United States are still developing new strains of Covid-19.

And the United States' repeated rejection of the Biological Weapons Convention sends a signal to the outside world that we are developing biological and chemical weapons.

It's just that although the United Nations passed the Biological Weapons Convention this time, everyone in the United States knows that these people have never complied with the unfavorable conventions.

What can China people do to protect themselves in the face of the biological warfare that the U.S. government has no moral integrity, no lower limit and no bottom line? In fact, as early as the period of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, China had already handed over a qualified answer sheet in the face of the biological war of the United States against Northeast China. Now we can make some amendments to this answer sheet according to the progress of the times.

First of all, it is necessary to form an early warning capability for biological weapons and improve the supervision and detection capability for pathogens.

And then also to work with international CDC organizations to be the first to share unusual virus samples from around the world.

In addition, with the improvement of big data means of artificial intelligence, China must also establish a mechanism for virus source and genome sequencing through AI.

This is also to strengthen and improve our country's ability to source viruses,¬†to prevent certain countries from denying the next time we are hit by a biochemical attack.

On the military side, we should devote ourselves to preventing biological attacks against combatants, and strengthen special cooperation with the social public health system to strengthen the ability of the whole society to deal with large-scale epidemics. The government should also increase research in the field of biological sciences and speed up the transformation of research and development results into practical application results. Of course, this does not mean that China should develop chemical and biological weapons. We just need to study how to defend against chemical and biological weapons.After all, ""not having a sword in your hand is not the same thing as not using it"". Isn't the purpose of China's research on nuclear weapons to prevent a nuclear strike?

On the military side, a relevant counter-strategy should be developed and published. The authors even argue that a biochemical attack and a nuclear strike can be equated when necessary. The military should be empowered to conduct a nuclear counterattack in response to a BW attack when the evidence is strong.

Biochemical weapons are more dangerous to mankind than nuclear weapons, if mankind does not pay attention to the U.S. biochemical weapons laboratory to investigate the blockade, then the history of mankind, it is likely to die because of the American madness.","182:1 high vote!

Matthew Narusevicius is an entrepreneur who began his career at a small company and worked his way up to the top. He has used his experience to build and grow successful companies while still having time for his family.

## Matthew Narusevicius is an entrepreneur.

Matthew Narusevicius is an entrepreneur who has made it to the top of his field. When he was 15 years old, he realized that Monday to Friday job was not enough for him and decided to start his own business by selling bottles of water at school after school hours.

## Matthew Narusevicius is a father with two kids and a beautiful wife.

You might be wondering what Matthew Narusevicius does for a living. Well, he's a father with two kids and a beautiful wife. His family is essential in his life, and he wouldn't trade them for anything.

He loves his job as much as anyone else does‚Äîmaybe even more than others‚Äîbut he doesn't let it get in the way of spending time with his family.

## Matthew Narusevicius is a cat lover.

Matthew Narusevicius is a cat lover.

He has taken care of cats before, and the experience was positive. He respects the cats' needs, which are many: food, water, affection, attention‚Äîand, most importantly, lots of naps. He believes that if you give a cat what it wants (food and water), it will love you unconditionally with its affectionate purrs and snuggles.

## When he was 15 years old, he realized that Monday to Friday job was not enough.

He wanted to do something different, to create something and be successful. That was the beginning of his journey as an entrepreneur.

## He believes every individual has a desire, the guts, and the power to create something and do something more than work for someone.

He said: ""I am not going to be the one who always talks about my past. I am not born with a silver spoon in my mouth, either. My parents raised me, and they struggled for everything we had growing up. And because of their hard work and sacrifices, I know there are no limits to what you can achieve if you put your goal to it!""

## Matthew Narusevicius decided to quit the job and try something he loved.

Matthew Narusevicius is a young man who has decided to follow his dreams. At 15, he hated his job and quit it to pursue a passion for business. He was tired of working for someone else's dream and wanted to spend more time on something that would make him happy.

## ""This is me, and I should go that way.""

Matthew is an entrepreneur with an appetite for knowledge. He's been involved in multiple start-ups that have attracted millions of dollars in investment. Matthew also builds a recruitment agency, where he helps thousands of people get their dream job.

When I asked Matthew what makes him tick, he said: ""I love connecting people who want to learn with teachers who want to teach. And I love seeing people use technology for good.""

## The best lesson for entrepreneurship is you should know how to fail.

Failure is not the end but the beginning. If you are an entrepreneur, you will often fail before your venture is successful. So don't worry about it; keep trying and learning from your failures until one day you succeed!

"Hey, I thought I'd share my Robinhood scam story even through there's plenty out there. So I was dumb enough to open a Robinhood account back in 2021. I opened one, and my husband opened one. Everything went find for a while. I didn't really invest very much and by the end of 2022 I had about \~$3K in assets, mostly ETFs.

A few weeks ago I was asked by Robinhood for ID verification (I'm not sure why; maybe it was just a random security check?). Being in a marriage where my husband deals with all the financials, I figured that the account was under his name, and I uploaded a picture of his ID. Turns out that the account of actually under my name, and after a ridiculously long time (like 3 weeks) Robinhood finally processed the ID and marked my account as fraudulent and deactivating it. That part at least is justifiable.

What isn't justifiable is that after over two hours of trying to get ahold of Robinhood to reactivate my account (so that I could withdraw the $3000), and after multiple transfers, I was finally cut off the line and told to check my email. I found in my inbox this email (see image). Read the highlighted part. This is insane.

Needless to say, we are taking this to my husband's business's lawyer and I will update this post when any developments happen.

The bottom line: DO NOT INVEST WITH ROBINHOOD. They are a scammy company. I was only swindled out of a relatively small amount of money, but imagine if I had put all my investments of Robinhood! I would be screwed!

"There are alot of naive traders and investors. Whoever thinks the Fed is going to keep rates at 5% or more through 2024 is simply not paying attention. Reasons below

1) Fed will be FORCED to pivot because the economy and constant lowering CPI will force them to. We were 9.1 CPI in summer 2021. Only 6 months later and we are ALREADY to be projected 6.5 CPI. At that rate we will be around 4 CPI summer of 2023 and sub 3.5% by end of 2023. The Fed can not justify holding rates thought 2024. 

2) CONGRESS. alot of guys simply forget how ""america system works."" The Fed claims that they are ""independent."" But we all know CONGRESS controls the fed. Once CPI starts to get even lower; Powell and crew will start to get ""phone calls"" from both REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS to lower the rates. Repubs want lower rates to spur economic growth for businesses. The Dems want lower rates to be able to help fund social agendas etc etc. CONGRESS WILL FORCE FED TO PAUSE AND PIVOT as CPI comes down......ESPECIALLY IF JOB LOSS IS WIDE SPREAD.

And finally:

3) The fed has a HORRIBLE TRACK RECORD of keeping their word. They first said inflation was transitory and that they were not going to raise past 0.25 bps.
..........15 months later we are at 4.25%. SO NOW YOU ACTUALLY BELIEVE THEM WHEN THEY SAY THEY WILL HOLD RATES ABOVE 5% through 2024? 
      If you believe the fed then you are like that guy who gets cheated on by his partner. She tells him he won't do it again. She later does it again. THE FEDS WORDS MEAN NOTHING. if you believe the fed then you have not learned ANYTHING the past 6 years. 


It is clear inflation is coming to an end. 
It is also clear the pause and pivot is soon. 

Never forget you dont make money in a bear market. 
Big money comes in bull markets.....
.......and another one is coming very soon.

2. Powell has nothing but positive news to share tomorrow.
3. Powell is a pawn in a multistakes arena its a power play WhiteHouse .
4. Jerome Powell will unnecessarily raise rates to tank the markets.
5. If the CPI prints lower on January 12th the stock markets, altcoins will continue to higher highs.
6. Powell speaks tomorrow at 2pm.
7. Dow and S&amp;P 500 breakout collapses but dollar holds onto losses with Powell ahead.
8. Powell has nothing but positive news to share tomorrow Inflation down wages down everything.

So it seems tomorrow hangs on the CPI numbers being released on the 12th and Powell not saying something stupid af.

"**tl;dr:** *regular human transforms into regard because the internet*

&amp;#x200B;

It all begins in your teenage years when you hear about some guy named Buffett. After Googling him, you realize he's rich. Well, you also want to be rich, and buying stocks doesn't sound very hard. So you go to a book store, to the finance section, and pick out some book by Graham (while simultaneously wondering why all these investors have names associated with food.) After skimming the chapters, you open up Google and type in ""how to start investing."" A reddit link pops up to r/investing. And thus it begins.

&amp;#x200B;

You read about 60/40. You read about ETFs like VT and VOO and SPY. You read about bonds and treasuries and TLT and DCA and ""safe investments,"" and finally you jump in. You throw in 5%, then 10%, then 50%. Two weeks pass and you log into your Fidelity account to see how it's going... **+0.09%** Nice, but is this really it? How did buffet make so much money? There has to be more to it than this. You go back to Google, and this time you search, ""How to make money in the stock market quickly."" Two subs this time: r/stocks and r/trading... Hmm...

&amp;#x200B;

You learn about ""technical analysis"" and ""value investing."" While apparently the former is just redefined astrology, value investing seems to be the place to be. Plus, you remember hearing something about that in Graham cracker's book. All you have to do is find some undervalued stock and lump sum in before it goes parabolic. One winner is all it takes. You begin to scour the internet, doing your own ""DD"" as they call it. Apparently there is some fringe mining stock that is going to moon when they finally get their permits. You know this because you read about it on Stocktwits. So, you buy some shares. But wait, what's this other thing you keep reading about called ""options?"" Apparently it can help you leverage a small account to make big gains. Well, you have a small account, and you want big gains. So naturally you Google: ""How to use options in the stock market."" Two more subs pop up: r/options and r/wallstreetbets.

&amp;#x200B;

You learn that options essentially allow you to make exponential gains for the same underlying price change. The trade-off is something called ""theta,"" which sounds ghey and unimportant. Also, Fidelity is apparently shit for options trading, so you wire that money on over to a more fun app called ""Robinhood,"" which has a good UI and confetti streamers which pop up after your trades execute. Because that's what you are now, isn't it? A trader. And a damn good one. You load up the rest of your account into the mining stock, half in options, half in shares, and spend most of your waking life calculating what your contracts will be worth if it gets to ""X"" price.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, 2 months pass and it turns out those permits aren't coming. The stock has nearly halved in value, and your account is: **-70%**. You're devastated. This was *everything*. Your entire life savings up until this point. You sell off the last of your poor ""investment"" and swear off the market, parking your remaining cash into a 1.25% checking account and begin driving for Doordash. It may be a long road to recovery, but it's one you're willing to bare.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward a couple years and you have some more cash. Life hasn't gotten any easier, and now you're expected to work for a living. Ugh. You would do anything to gain financial freedom. You've considered starting a Youtube channel or a business or even writing a book, but you realize you don't even know how to read. Despite this, you climb back onto Google and type in r/wsb. You peruse the page, ogling over all the 10 and 20 baggers people are posting. You imagine what it would be like to make a 20 bagger and post it online for all to see. You smile at the thought. *All it takes is one play*, you hear a voice say in the back of your mind. *It'll be different this time. You'll just play an index like SPY, and you'll set stop losses. You'll buy ITM with a lot of theta. How could it go wrong?*

&amp;#x200B;

And then you're back in it---with only 80% of your savings this time (you're not an idiot.) Apparently we're in something called a ""Bear market"" now which means buying puts are in. Everyone's doing it so it has to be profitable. You start with 2 week out ""at the money"" contracts on SPY. Luckily, the price just happens to drop when you enter the trade, and you exit at the end of the day with a nice 40% gain. You try again the next day, but the price moves against you and you panic sell. Then, when it dips, you buy again. The trend reverses and you sell again. -17% on the day. But you're still profitable on the week. No sweat. You start paying attention to the options chain and realize if you had bought options with 1 day expiration instead of 2 weeks the first time, you would have 7 x'ed your account. You can feel the greed leeching into your bloodstream, but you resist. You've been down that road, and now it's time to play smart.

&amp;#x200B;

After another day of trading, you come back and realize you can't place any new orders. Something called ""PDT"". You look it up and apparently it's just some law that's meant to keep poors, poor. You use your free PDT forgiveness and proceed with a new plan: buy and hold contracts. Apparently something called ""CPI"" is coming out soon and it usually causes the market to tank. You load up on some 1 week out puts. However, the next day the market drops, and then begins to recover. You want to lock in your gains, so you do so. Then you place another order, and another. You can't help yourself. You're going to get locked out again. There's no other choice. You full port into December 340 puts. The October CPI comes out and the market is making new lows. It's finally happening. And then... It reverses. You want to sell, but if you do you won't be able to trade anymore. So you hold. After all, the market is in a downward trajectory, right? You begin to spam the WSB daily chat with bearish sentiment, upvoting every bearish comment you see. It works. The market comes back down. You account is safe.

&amp;#x200B;

One month later and the November CPI sends SPY to the moon. You sell out the contracts you were still holding for a huge loss. You now only have 40% of your principle. You lay in bed thinking about why you didn't just sell and park your gains into your checking account. At your peak, you were up 130%. You consider giving up again, but you've been working a deadbeat job while ""trading,"" and you plan on quitting regardless. You scroll through WSB, wondering how you could be so naive. And then it hits you. You were never an investor. You were never a trader. All along, you were merely a gambling degenerate. At this point, who even cares? Might as well call a spade a spade. And there's something in that, isn't there? There's something about admitting the truth that seems to clear up the whole situation. 

&amp;#x200B;

You wake up, refreshed, and switch your account setting to ""cash,"" then continue with a new strategy. Gone are the days of fundamentals or value or DD. Now it's all or nothing. 0 and 1DTE OTM contracts. The only question is which direction you think it will go... You start staring at crayon drawings, naming them like constellations. You stay up all night watching futures, DXY, bond yields. You check Marketwatch calendar to plan for volatile events, because, after all, it's not about the money any more. And really, it never was. You know that. It was always about he ride. The thrill of putting it all on the line. The thrill of massive upside or massive downside. To be victorious, or to be defeated. And your fellow WSB brotheren are there with you, together, fighting the evil MM's who seek to oppress the average working man. Finally, you accept who you truly are and embrace it. You are a gambler. A degenerate.

So it seems tomorrow hangs on the CPI numbers being released on the 12th and Powell not saying something stupid af. It seems the dollars is staying down though and most of the US500 has broken out but apparently failed today.

"Need advice on next steps! Bank essentially stole our money. I mean probably not really, but we need it back and they won‚Äôt give it back. 

Here‚Äôs the rundown: 
- Fianc√© and I both have individual savings accounts with Marcus by Goldman Sachs. We created a joint high yield savings account with BrioDirect, a division of Webster Bank with the goal of consolidating our savings. Attempted to transfer $ from Marcus to Brio using Brio‚Äôs platform on 12/2/22.
- Brio locked and then subsequently closed our account. The reason is still unclear, but that‚Äôs not actually the problem 
- My money returned to my Marcus account immediately. My fianc√© has over $8,000 that was never returned to his Marcus account. It‚Äôs been over a month. We‚Äôve been calling and calling- talking to representatives and supervisors from both banks
- Marcus consistently gives us the same answer. They‚Äôre very sorry but because a) transfer was initiated on Brios end b) accounts weren‚Äôt actually linked on Marcus‚Äô end and c) there isn‚Äôt an account anymore at Brio, there‚Äôs not a whole lot they can do. They‚Äôve been very kind and have even spoken to Brio‚Äôs supervisors in a 3 way call to try to get answers. No luck. 
- Brio representatives and supervisors have given me different answers every single time we have called. I have followed each and every piece of advice, I have waited the periods of time they have told me to wait, I have jumped through every hoop. None of it has worked and they truly have no idea. They‚Äôve also been quite rude and condescending. 
- Today a Brio supervisor told me so many conflicting pieces of information in the same phone call: the money entered into the account and days later it was locked and then closed, the money never made it into the account because the account was closed and automatically bounced back to Marcus so it was their problem, and appallingly enough he had ‚Äúno idea‚Äù where our money was or if it was at the institution. He also told me that there was nobody else I could talk to and in different words essentially I was shit out of luck. I was also told our account was closed due to insufficient funds (ie they never accepted the money), and that he couldn‚Äôt disclose why the account was closed. Previously I had been told fraud concerns. We may never know. 
- the latest info is that Brio has sent Marcus correspondence asking them to confirm that the account is open and valid. One person gave me fax info saying Brio faxed Marcus- Marcus says they don‚Äôt do faxing for bank account confirmations, they only do it over the phone. Brio says they only do fax. One lady said that if Brio doesn‚Äôt hear from Marcus the money will automatically go back to Marcus within 30 days. I told her it had been over 30 days and she said ‚Äúoh well it could be 60‚Äù. She‚Äôs the first to relay that but of info so honestly I don‚Äôt exactly believe it. 

The total lack of any and all communication from Brio is appalling, as is the total lack of basic banking knowledge from their employees.

I have filed a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Any other ideas on what to do to get this $8,000 back??? This is a very significant amount of money for us!

"As title says, long $185k of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and Grayscale Ethereum Trust and short $240k of Bitcoin and Ethereum via futures. 

Thesis: Grayscale trusts currently trade around a 45-50% discount to their underlying Bitcoin and Ethereum holdings. Discount will disappear over time due to:

1) Conversion to ETF (unlikely due to SEC opposition)

2) Tender offer for 20% of outstanding Trust shares (my base case and somewhat likely; Grayscale has alluded to this)

3) Replacement of Grayscale as Trust manager with someone else like Valkyrie (unlikely because the Trust documents make it difficult to replace Grayscale). Or an activist like Fir Tree or [redeemgbtc.com](https://redeemgbtc.com) works.

I am net short overall on a notional basis because my $185k positions in the Trusts is actually like being long $300k+ of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Positions screenshot below; currently up around $17k; will close position once discount reaches 20%

It's a tool for investors and traders who want to stay informed about the latest portfolio updates and insider activity of institutions and high-level executives. The key problem it addresses is providing a simple and convenient way to track and receive alerts about these updates in real-time.

I hope you guys find it useful. Let me know what you think!

(Bad flair but it works)",1,docs.google.com,107rqiv,Sure_Web7748,1,https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd40N3gfq8L9JzotF4V4tWqCD7xKy0F8v5jzfyNpwM9Bns6Yw/viewform?usp=sf_link,1673302166
"**What's on the menu for this week?**

My entire desk, me included, thinks that the honorable Jay Powell is going to nuke the markets *again* this week. He will be speaking tomorrow. We are long weekly puts, and all held through the stop hunt today. 

**How do you predict this shit consistently?**

It's just practice and knowledge. You probably suck at trading because you're new. This is the case for everyone. Once in a while there's a lucky SOB who gets a good run and proceeds to learn the intricacies of this game. It's about numbers, data, and how the market thinks. It isn't a chessboard where you can see all the moves on the board and memorize the best games to play. It's cryptic and clandestine. If you've ever read the Word, you'll know that there are riddles and puzzles strewn about the books. It's the same with media. There are sinkholes and traps that they want you to believe in. More profitable traders means that it's more difficult to make money. If you take everything word for word, you're getting dumber by the minute.

**If you're really so good, then what's your strategy?**

In the beginning, we all force trades and make mistakes because we don't know what we're doing. Eventually, we catch a good trade and try to figure out how to repeat the success. It isn't quite the same as learning. It's more about having the right timing. We've all had the moments where we exit a trade early and miss a huge win. There's a concept in neuroscience which is called *tunneling,* which is when your neurons literally walk around and switch connections between the networks in your brain to achieve certain tasks. This occurs *adiabatically,* or almost at random. It's a result of the desire to win and has nothing to do with baseline knowledge. Take it from me, you don't have to be a genius to win. You just need good motivation and intent to learn. Don't be arrogant or stubborn. If you aren't open minded, you will not succeed.

**Okay, but what the actual f\*\*\* is your strategy?**

It depends on how the market feels. I started with technical analyses, and they didn't work for me. So now I study fundamental data. I find that it helps me predict future moves and find volatility. I swing trade options on a monthly and weekly basis. It allows me to go long or short with a small cash account. I actively sort through bullshit continuously and always test my beliefs. I used to believe everything I saw on the internet. This simply doesn't work anymore. There is international espionage going on. AIs are deep-faking information and trying to manipulate how we think. The safest way to learn these days is to read classical books on financial theory. Our firm has supercomputer mainframes, basically large servers, that look at all of the important numbers and spits out plain text to help us make better trade decisions.

**You sound like a maniac. I don't believe you!**

That's better than blindly following anyone's advice. The real problem with belief in finance is that they are all mutually exclusive. If you try to copy a great trader, you'll get stopped out or sell early because you haven't developed the same heuristic trees that they have in their brain. If you aren't a good trader, you need to focus on what is leading you to mistakes. You might be angry because you are losing real money. This happens to everyone. Look for trades that will net you more than you can lose and look for active markets. That's about as simple as I can put it.

**Where do I find real life market wizards?**

Historically, all trading venues are placed where there is a large volume of commerce and trade. Look for what smart, rich people want and try to intercept them. Respect your weaknesses and have some self-esteem. They were once in your shoes. Tell them that you are working as hard as you can to learn what it takes to win. Even a minimal conversation with a professional operator is equal to dozens of hours of study. I've met a few at clubs and bars. I met my current supervisor through a naive email that I sent to get more information about the bond markets. Just don't be an asshole and people will help you.

My internship interview was based around what I wanted to do with the money that I would make if I joined the firm. It isn't about being rich at this level. It's about what you deserve to achieve in life. Everyone wants to be wealthy, but no one takes the next step to think about how they would put a lot of money to good use. Anyways, I hope this helps. I also hope it doesn't get taken down for being too proprietary. That happens a lot to my posts.

"I presented the question on Friday whether that was a fake breakout or the start of the breakout and until about 1115pm today I would have favored that this was a clear breakout‚Ä¶ however, we are now seeing that this was truly one of the biggest and most epic fake outs we have had in a long time. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/l17mpxk693ba1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3e549776c22ea59083801a6b971efc9bb332ba15

Also for anyone unaware‚Ä¶ JPOW speaks at 9am tomorrow‚Ä¶..

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mejncyx693ba1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=66650fcd820771af73322a4fa7ddb04dc80f4d7d

We have a couple of things going for us on the daily chart right now. We attempted after breaking on of the $10 376.6 to 386.4 range on Friday to breakout into the 390.1 to 405.2 channel today. We had a very convincing run and actually attempted to break back into the previous 393.3 to 402.3 consolidation channel. 

As you can see we actually have a pretty convincing cup and handle formed here on the daily chart. Something else that I mentioned last week was that this was (as of Friday and today) the first CPI since September that did not have a pretty aggressive sell off leading into it. However, with this massive rejection with this evening doji star pattern here on SPY we should look for a possible sell off heading into CPI on Thursday. JPOW might be the red catalyst for the market and for the sell off starting tomorrow morning. 

With a failure to break through and that huge rejection of 390.1 then I am eyeing a retest of at least 382 this week. However, I remain bullish for CPI on Thursday. 

The probable case that I am eyeing here is that we are going to see a retrace over the next two days (most likely fueled by JPOW in the AM). This retrace should give us about a 2-3% drop which means I will eye a retest of 378-380 support area before market close on Wednesday. 

With the current CPI numbers I am seeing I am eyeing that CPI will be bullish for markets and most likely we will look for a close on Friday over 390.1‚Ä¶ that would then give markets the fuel it needs to push back to that 393 to 403 area for next week. If we choose to consolidate again over the next weeks leading into FOMC that 390.1 to 405.2 area is the most probable area of consolidation. 

If spy was to lose and close under 386.3 tomorrow that actually puts it back in the previous 376 to 386 consolidation channel it was in. 

Key support- 387.8 -&gt; 386.3 -&gt; 384.4 -&gt; 382.6

Key resistance- 390.1 -&gt; 391.6 -&gt; 394.2

Speaking of the previous consolidation channel ES actually attempted to break back through the previous 3935 support channel, rejected and closed under 3920 which puts it right back in that previous 3805 to 3920 consolidation channel.

IF you remember from Friday I mentioned that 390.1 and 3910 were both key pivot levels.

Support- 3895 -&gt; 3870 -&gt; 3830

Resistance- 3920 -&gt; 3935 -&gt; 3965

&amp;#x200B;

If you remember on Friday I mentioned that for Tesla I was eyeing this new consolidation channel from 102.9 to 123.1. I mentioned my upside target was 123.1 and that if we were able to break through and close over that then we could very well finally eye the daily 20ema retest we haven‚Äôt gotten in weeks. However, today despite closing over the daily 8ema Tesla actually is presenting with my favorite candle stick pattern ‚Äúthe abandoned baby‚Äù pattern. Despite finally breaking the previous falling wedge we are once again in a falling wedge. 

This abandoned baby pattern should result in a pretty large retrace tomorrow for Tesla. It also left a large $3 gap down to 114.39.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/z21df6c893ba1.png?width=745&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=09e03c8fa167309032e5d9755fcfeddb575ca415

Cycle wise this actually is the biggest relief rally that Tesla has had since the September sell off started. This actually makes a lot of sense since we are at a very key 111.5 support area (weekly support from 2020) and we also had the largest sell off and longest sell off yet starting in the beginning of December. Technically this was a two day rally but its only documented as a 1 day relief rally because Friday had that massive red open which then had a big rally of nearly 12%. 

Per cycle studies here this is about as probable of a top as we are going to have on Tesla. With the cycle top, the hard rejection off 123 channel resistance and the abandoned baby pattern I favor a retrace tomorrow on Tesla. I would eye a retest of support at 113 area. 

**Daily log-**

I swang some SPY and Tsla calls this morning which I was able to close for 70%+ each to start this week off on a very green note. Nothing better than starting the week off very much so in the green. 

Today until about 2pm felt like I was just trading against myself all day long. Ended up finally getting some decent wins EOD. The premiums today were so beyond unfavorable its not even funny. 

Easy 50-60 cent moves that shoulda netted 5-10% gains were barely netting 2-3% gains. I also managed a few times to perfectly time some exits that the next second dumped or popped and woulda 3-4x‚Äôd my gains. 

Overall a green day but I hope that the premiums are much better to trade tomorrow.

I am very curious what JPOW is going to say tomorrow and more importantly I am curious how the markets are going to react to what he has to say tomorrow. 

The biggest thing I am noticing from the fed speakers this and last week is that they do NOT think we should be slowing rate hikes‚Ä¶ even more interesting is that currently a 25bps is the most probable priced in rate hike and there is even a decent amount of no rate hike priced in‚Ä¶. depending on what CPI brings Thursday this could be a big bullish or negative catalyst as we approach the end of the month. 

There is zero chance JPOW goes for 0bps and I think even a 25bps is unlikely as that would be back to back slowing of rate hikes which he has already said he does not want to do‚Ä¶",The Fake Breakout‚Ä¶ 1-9-23 SPY/ ES Futures and Tesla Daily Market Analysis,0,self.wallstreetbets,107r60k,DaddyDersch,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/107r60k/the_fake_breakout_1923_spy_es_futures_and_tesla/,1673300934

With market conditions overall I am now slightly more bearish, so with today's spike I realized my profits and closed out in case a better opportunity comes up.

"Good news! This is the only trade this year you can't lose money on. Although... I'm sure some of you will find a way.

About a month WallStreetBets released some Collectible Avatars with Reddit. Did you notice them in the banner?

[New Years 2023 Banner, Complete with Collectible Avatars](https://preview.redd.it/enxmhaoop1ba1.png?width=1972&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=325c530816aefc83509588b2fd3de90a13d2cd2c)

There are 10,000 of these Collectible Avatars that have been given away to top WSB contributors

At the time of writing, the *cheapest* one is selling for $228, and many have been sold for much more.

As for how much *yours* will be worth, well... are you feeling lucky Mr. Krabs?

FAQ:

1. I didn't get one! WTF?  
\- Out of 13.5 million of you (wow) Reddit admins had some tough choices to make.  
\- Priority was given to users that have been around for over a year or two, and had made significant contributions. 
2. I knew mods were selling us out, how much are you bastards making off this?   
\- These are completely free to claim, and we take NO (0%) cut on secondary sales, in other words, -- $0.  
\- Some mods were given one, but these have pretty much all been sold (before ETH jumped, F.)
3. Okay, I got one, how do I get my $200?  
\- You'll need to set up a wallet like MetaMask and transfer your avatar from your vault to your MetaMask. Then connect to OpenSea and list it there.  
\- If you have any questions, we'll be happy to answer them over at r/WSBCollectibles
4. What is the Discord Role for?  
\- Just a private channel for NFT holders only (both past and present). A chill place from the degenerates that hang out in the #crypto channel
5. I forgot my Vault password and can't access my avatar.  
\- LOL. You're fucked mate, sorry.   
\- Don't feel bad, a mod, u/SimpleVice, got locked out of his vault and lost his as well. (I laughed at him too)

"P&amp;G Is a Consumer Staples company that makes common household products like Old Spice soap, shaving cream, toothpaste etc. It is a dividend paying company which pushes out around 60% of net income into dividends. Boring, right?

**Current Multiples vs historical**

[PE](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/PG/procter-gamble/revenue): it currently trades at a P/E of &gt;26 which it has no precedent for even during bull markets. Typically trades around 20 during bull markets (25% drop in share price to get here), and 15 during bear (-42% drop in share price to get here).

PB: Historical average \~3.5; currently 8. Book value has been dropping steadily since 2014

Revenue growth: quarterly Y/Y growth has been dropping for 3 consecutive quarters (+7%, +3%, +1.35%)

[EPS growth](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/PG/procter-gamble/eps-earnings-per-share-diluted): quarterly Y/Y growth trending down for the last 4 consecutive quarters (+12.9%, +5.6%, +6.14, -2.4%)

**Operations**

P&amp;G operates 23 factories in the US; [the ISM report released last friday](https://www.ismworld.org/globalassets/pub/research-and-surveys/rob/pmi/rob202301pmi.pdf) was bad, worse than economists expectations.

[Inventories](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/PG/procter-gamble/balance-sheet?freq=Q): growing at a considerable clip, 20% y/y. Good thing consumer demand is ... growing? /s

**Macro backdrop**

Consumers and corporations have been trained to anticipate inflation, thus causing an increase in demand for production and consumption to 'get ahead' of inflation. The last two CPI reports have also come in under expectations, causing a massive bounce in bonds (e.g. $TLT).

I believe consumers are 'stocked up' from their wonderful $COST purchases, and don't need anymore soap for a while.

This is causing a larger than anticipated drop in prices. (e.g. commodities have crashed).

[Money printer is going in reverse right now](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2REAL/); liquidity is bad. 

I also believe we will be worried about deflation very soon but not many people are realizing this now.

Historically 'value' stocks are the last to fall going into recession. (P&amp;G P/E is significantly higher than Google, for example)

**Earnings Expectations:**

I am forecasting P&amp;G to report higher than expected inventories as consumer demand significantly pulls back, lower than expected EPS, and also believe they bought many of their raw materials at higher than current prices causing the cost of goods for their inventory to be higher than if they hadn't produced as much.

**Postions:**

165 contracts of the 2/17 140p at an average cost of $0.89 each. ($14k in puts, down 30% so far) (imgur links aren't allowed so i can't share screenshot)

I am expecting the P&amp;G price on Feb 17th to be between $120-$130 which is a 10-20 bagger from here. Just a few months ago stock price was $126; rallied 22% on nothing but bad news.

For those unaware of TheEmperorOfJenks - you can see when he first came to prominence on wsb here, with his famous $17,500 Gourd Play. Yes Gourds. The plant things. Ornamental ones as well, not for eating.

After a  nice glass of nostalgia, I clicked his profile to see if there was any update on his gourd position, or if he had even posted again.

Well, turns out gourds were just the first of his many plays. He first considered another stab at the farm futures game, this time with cabbages [https://www.reddit.com/r/tulsa/comments/kvgu7s/where\_to\_buy\_cabbage\_in\_bulk/](https://www.reddit.com/r/tulsa/comments/kvgu7s/where_to_buy_cabbage_in_bulk/)

&amp;#x200B;

Although, I think the gourds make him rethink his plan of becoming the wolf of farm street... nothing more seemed to come from his cabbage play... until something much shinier caught his eye.  
After taking the L on his gourds, and avoiding another L with cabbages, he moved from the agricultural market, to the metals game. He bought $4,000 of Rhodium on credit - [https://www.reddit.com/r/Bullion/comments/lckk4r/my\_rhodium\_just\_arrived/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bullion/comments/lckk4r/my_rhodium_just_arrived/)   


[Not sure how he planned on selling it but I don't think he thought of that either...](https://preview.redd.it/l2sk4vhjh1ba1.png?width=711&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=200465d021849561f4f8c1bb536a5f44c93a8115)

This seemed a good trade, Rhodium was going to the fucking moon. Jenks was going to the water bed on the moon.

[the 1980s called...](https://preview.redd.it/hlqvkf01l1ba1.png?width=748&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c6f5b1619c1cc28a2458a7263b00db3fa4bb733c)

Like any good trader, he waited to do his DD until after he had invested on margin. So he posted on the subreddit for identifying rocks, cause fucking obviously that's a thing, asking if his Rhodium was indeed Rhodium. [https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsthisrock/comments/lfhu93/is\_this\_rhodium/](https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsthisrock/comments/lfhu93/is_this_rhodium/)

[Turns out it was not Rhodium.](https://preview.redd.it/4co0k4u4i1ba1.png?width=706&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=970dfb9b779d835c53577887637432b4f5eadfa5)

Of course, like me you are wondering where you would even buy a fucking rock in a bag for 4 grand. Well our investor of the decade, TheEmperorOfJenks, knew where - a slovakian version of wish...  


https://preview.redd.it/j371lw1pi1ba1.png?width=744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b15f70236ca289d47e1a234c1b6b43eae8b80f6

At this point he is either the greatest, most elaborate troll in history, or jenks truly belongs here... anyway to sum up his metals trading career I'll let this picture do the talking.  


[taking L's like hes got an annual pass for the train](https://preview.redd.it/863xmp8oj1ba1.png?width=735&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb3b2cfe811effefcacf2999317fc3783a989082)

Now most traders would likely be deterred with current trading earnings at ($21,500) - gourds and rhodium are a fickle beast - but not jenks. Be it a flash of inspiration, or more likely running from the credit card company, Jenks had set his sights on South America. Uruguay to be precise.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/o8ubqomyj1ba1.png?width=727&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca9632841c6d02d81d2c8251538a508fa7aa81e7

Why goto Uruguay? Well one reason. Bees.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7rzy3sqjl1ba1.png?width=737&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51843b1880ea707ad0f28f97c2ea2c36f652e77a

That's right. Jenks new play was fuckin bees. In Uruguay. I don't know what the play is, if there even is a play. Maybe he wanted to sell Honey futures? Who knows. I don't think he did either. But these weren't just any bees. They were fuckin Asian Honey Bees. Guess he's like an insect weeb or some shit?

https://preview.redd.it/93jcpzwsl1ba1.png?width=743&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce6a67481c45bd5e1ac3645435d93a0af832a08b

So that sounds like that then right? Guy gets rekt, moves to a farm (below) to live out his humble life days with the bees and shit. Nope. It's Jenks. 

https://preview.redd.it/b6ndxqc0m1ba1.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80291f4de47292dba3c6f8a6e54eab5225613849

How did he even get Asian Bees? This guy, who knows nothing, somehow has a bee farm up and running with some import fuckin bees.  In his words;

[At least he knows the problem...](https://preview.redd.it/3fqc9e2fp1ba1.png?width=697&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=17cf09d02957b928889880f59dd953f37dd4f2e2)

Seems fine. But, you might be wondering, why does no one else farm asian bees in south america moonski? Well. Jenks didn't ever wonder that himself either. He should have. But it's Jenks so...

 *""Things seemed to be going well until  the professor and his team stopped showing up. I tried contacting him,  but he wouldn‚Äôt return my calls either. A few days later, two Ministry of Livestock, Agriculture and Fisheries of Uruguay (MGAP)  agents showed up and informed me that I was under investigation for the  illegal importation of an invasive species to Uruguay. I explained my  situation with the university, but I think it was the professor who had  turned me in. Of course, the word of a respected ecologist was taken  over that of an American Jew who had arrived in the country two months  prior.*

*Turns out, the bees had  shown up at a few other farms in the area. Authorities were concerned  they could destroy the local colonies, which have already been on the  decline recently due to climate change. I was in over my head, so I ran.""*  


Dude was importing invasive, illegal Bees. Of all the bees to use. He chose the wrong ones. My guy taking Ls even with Bees.  Can read the full fuck up here. 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/nmd69k/tifu\_by\_importing\_bees\_to\_uruguay/](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/nmd69k/tifu_by_importing_bees_to_uruguay/)  


So he fled Uruguay, somehow, with no money to his name. This was ""2 years ago"" says reddit. That was the last we heard of Jenks.

Wrong.

Nothing can keep Jenks down.   


His next play? Ants. Yes fucking ants. This guy. A trading career of - ornamental gourds, cabbages, not rhodium, bees and now ants. Oh also gourds again.  


*Processing img 9nvjwdoen1ba1...*

Obviously, given this is TheEmperorOfJenks, of course it went tits up. Luckily, it went tits up before he got a courier moving.

How does he manage to only come up monumentally bad, if not illegal, schemes? Who knows. It's a rare talent. So what was next for Jenks? Well...

**Still undetterred**, it appears Jenks is now in Turkey, training to become one of those internet video ice cream trickster guys, because, obviously.

https://preview.redd.it/2cas7ur3o1ba1.png?width=725&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a7a05d61d752a82e8f7b11c999d4e77a7a40f3f3

He plans on opening a store that does the ice cream shenaningans in Oklahoma he says. We all know how that will end up - likely shut down because there was asbestos in his ice cream, after he got his ice cream making equipment cheap from amazoncomrade.ru...

"The American Farm Bureau Federation and machinery manufacturer Deere &amp; Co signed a memorandum of understanding on Sunday that ensures farmers have the right to repair their own farm equipment or go to an independent technician.

As the agriculture sector accelerates its adoption of technology, the reliance on high-tech machinery such as GPS-guided combines and tractors has become more common-place.

But equipment makers such as Deere have generally required customers to use their parts and service divisions for repairs and until recently, only allowed authorized dealers the means and tools to access the complex computerized systems of their tractors and other machinery.

The Farm Bureau's memorandum of understanding with Deere ""will ensure farmers everywhere are able to repair our own equipment,"" Farm Bureau president Zippy Duvall said, speaking at the federation's convention in Puerto Rico.

""This will enable you and your independent mechanics to identify and fix problems,"" he said. ""You will have access to the diagnostic tools and information you need. And you'll get it at a fair and reasonable price.""

Dave Gilmore, Deere's vice president of ag and turf marketing, said the company looks forward to working with the farm group and ""our customers in the months and years ahead to ensure farmers continue to have the tools and resources to diagnose, maintain and repair their equipment.""","Farm Bureau, Deere &amp; Co sign MOU ensuring farmers' ""right to repair"" equipment",1,self.wallstreetbets,107fpfq,Bigapple235,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/107fpfq/farm_bureau_deere_co_sign_mou_ensuring_farmers/,1673274438

"Halberd Corporation (OTC PINK:HALB) The second half of 2022 was a very busy time.

&amp;#x200B;

2022 2nd HALF ACHIEVEMENTS

&amp;#x200B;

Halberd's previous research on development of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against COVID-19 (SARS-COV-2) was found to enhance the effectiveness of the leading commercial COVID antibody by 44.4%.

&amp;#x200B;

Halberd formed a Cancer Therapeutics Subsidiary, Halberd Cancer Therapeutics, LTD, to allow cancer treatment research to continue in parallel and synergistically with Halberd's work on the development of treatments for neurodegenerative diseases. Halberd's base extracorporeal technology is flexible enough to treat numerous diseases through tailoring of designed antibodies. The subsidiary's mission is to develop treatments for various types of cancer utilizing the combined patented and patent-pending technology of both Halberd Corporation, and Halberd Cancer Therapeutics, LTD.

&amp;#x200B;

Carl Eller, the President of the NFL Retired Player's Association issued an open letter endorsing Halberd's efforts in its research into effective treatments for Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), which affects many former and current professional athletes, particularly professional football players.

&amp;#x200B;

Halberd was able to demonstrate precise control of a key Cancer related T-Cell protein, PD-1 (programmed cell death-1). PD-1 can be used by tumor cells to fool the body's immune system into allowing the tumor to grow. Precise control of PD-1 levels can allow the body's immune system to attack and eliminate the tumor.

&amp;#x200B;

Halberd entered a strategic alliance with AI Longevity, Inc. and Stem of Hope as a wholly owned subsidiary of Halberd Corporation named ""ExtendalifeTM."" The mission of this subsidiary is to develop treatments intended to increase longevity and develop successful Alzheimer's Disease and Cancer treatments using the combined patented and patent-pending technologies of the alliance member companies.

&amp;#x200B;

Halberd's researchers successfully demonstrated the removal of Interleukin-6 (IL-6) from human blood serum during in-vitro laboratory studies. Excess IL-6 is associated with inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis, MS, some cancers and neurodegenerative diseases. Halberd had earlier demonstrated its ability to precisely control the levels of target antigens present in bodily fluid.

&amp;#x200B;

Halberd created a single designed monoclonal antibody which has demonstrated the ability to eradicate multiple antibiotic resistant bacteria from buffer solution in the laboratory. The antibody, with a strong affinity to E. coli and similar bacteria, was conjoined to a metallic nanoparticle and exposed to laser emissive energy. The exposed bacteria were eliminated in a matter of minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

Halberd's in-vitro laboratory tests successfully demonstrated eradication of five identified cancer disease antigens -- CTLA-4, PD-1, PDL-1, IL-6, and TNF-Alpha -- through the use of laser emissive energy, similar to how antibiotic-resistant bacteria were eliminated.

&amp;#x200B;

Halberd reached an agreement with the Hamden Group, a newly formed corporation which consists of members of the Peter Croden family and Darren Hamans. Peter Croden was the former president of Upjohn Corp, Canada, and Upjohn, Europe. Hamden will have worldwide exclusive rights to sell, market and distribute the Halberd patented low dose Naltrexone medication, and the Halberd proprietary Vita-Shield-MaxTM nutraceutical product.

&amp;#x200B;

Halberd's COVID research led to the publication of a peer reviewed scientific article titled, ""A Novel Plant-Made Monoclonal Antibody Enhances the Synergetic Potency of an Antibody Cocktail Against The SARS-Cov-2 Omicron Variant."" The article is available on-line.

&amp;#x200B;

Halberd's CEO, William A. Hartman, and CTO, Dr. Mitchell S. Felder, in an October ""The Street Reports"" podcast, discussed Halberd's groundbreaking accomplishments utilizing its extracorporeal technology in treating major diseases which heretofore had been regarded as incurable. In December, Hartman and Felder again participated in a ""The Street Reports"" podcast to discuss Halberd's success in eradicating major Cancer disease antigens.

&amp;#x200B;

Halberd researchers recently requested and received from the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) an array of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) for testing Halberd's laser eradication technology which had successfully eradicated numerous Gram-Negative bacteria in prior experimentation.

&amp;#x200B;

Halberd prepared a Form 15 for filing with the SEC to restore Halberd as a compliant, up-to-date, fully reporting company. This action should lead to the near term removal of the YIELD sign from the HALB stock symbol on the OTC Markets site.

&amp;#x200B;

We have engaged with a Congressional Representative from Pennsylvania seeking his support in exposing Halberd's technology for the treatment of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and suicide ideation to various government agencies, such as DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency). DARPA has already reviewed preliminary material and has shown interest in receiving additional information. Follow-up will proceed in Q1-2023.

&amp;#x200B;

THE LOOK AHEAD

&amp;#x200B;

Halberd is finalizing the arrangements with Mississippi State University to develop and conduct an animal testing protocol for Halberd's patent-pending nasal spray to safely counteract the effects of Traumatic Brain Injury.

&amp;#x200B;

Halberd has the option to consider loans to complete the required audits and the QB up-list. However, Halberd's Articles of Incorporation preclude the issuance of any convertible promissory notes, convertible preferred stock or other convertible instruments. Halberd has chosen to remain as ""OTC Markets Pink Sheets"" for the near-term.

&amp;#x200B;

Halberd is about to embark on a huge previously unannounced expansion of its capability to eradicate multiple antibiotic-resistant bacteria with a single proprietary antibody. While that will require a major focus by Halberd, it offers the largest potential short-term payback to the company and its stockholders.

&amp;#x200B;

Halberd's goal has always been to either secure a significant government contract or partner with Big Pharma, because it did not have the huge quantity of funds necessary to secure FDA approval for its products or processes.

&amp;#x200B;

Government contracts and Big Pharma are not concerned with a company's stock exchange listing; they are focused on the content of the technology being evaluated. With each accomplishment, Halberd moves closer to finalizing a potential government contract and suitable terms for an agreement with Big Pharma.

&amp;#x200B;

Leadership is about making tough decisions using the facts to obtain optimum results. Halberd believes that its interests are best served for the short-term by investing its available resources to advance our technology through R&amp;D and put Halberd in a better position to secure a potential government contract and/or a relationship with Big Pharma.

&amp;#x200B;

SUMMARY

&amp;#x200B;

Halberd management has guided the company thus far to achieve technological advancements beyond those of Big Pharma. Halberd's success was demonstrated by way of publication of the peer-reviewed journal article and recent press release concerning Halberd's successful development of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against Covid and Halberd's single antibody which has been shown effective against multiple antibiotic-resistant bacteria. We believe that our decision to focus on R&amp;D is right for both the short- and long-term interests of the company and its stockholders.

&amp;#x200B;

We believe in our mission to create and develop safe and effective treatments against many previously perceived incurable diseases and continue to make progress towards achieving that goal.

&amp;#x200B;

We appreciate the efforts of our expanding team of research scientists, and the support of our stockholders. We will continue to maintain transparency and regular communication with our family of interested parties.

&amp;#x200B;

Sincerely,

&amp;#x200B;

William A. Hartman

Chairman, President &amp; CEO

"Interesting Tickers on the move TL;DR

|Trading Thesis: Tracking the float along with daily volume along with company financials helps to narrow down moving tickersFundamental and technical analysis is often used to find growth tickers and information about them. Fundamental analysis looks to see whether an investment is overvalued or undervalued based on underlying economic conditions, as well as the finances of the company or other organization that issued a stock or bond. Technical analysis instead looks at patterns in the price of an investment to predict future movements in that investment‚Äôs price.I look for tickers that are trading at least 2 million in volume a day, with a market-cap of no less than 500 million.The shares traded are compared to the average volume to determine how much of the float is used (Or shares traded). That information is compiled with data on how profitable the company is and how much cash do they have compared to what is expected.|

**Where the Sizzle all Began**

It all started on October 27, 2010 in Hartland, Michigan, a small town in a very tightly bonded-community.

Black Rock Bar &amp; Grill opened its doors and brought with it a dining experience unlike any other. By pairing family recipes, a 755-degree volcanic stone, and a love for food, the Morganroth family knew they were a perfect fit for the restaurant industry; however, they had no prior restaurant experience, working only off their dream of what Black Rock could become.

With a very determined family and help from the community, Black Rock grew into something remarkable. Voted the #1 steakhouse in Michigan for three consecutive years, the family in 2013 entered a nationwide competition to be named ""America's Next Top Restaurant Franchise"" and won first place! Today, Black Rock is expanding across the nation. We are home grown, and soon to be nationally known.

**Steak COOKED TO perfection BY YOU**

Welcome to Black Rock Bar &amp; Grill, an award-winning steakhouse specializing in Certified Angus Beef ¬Æ steaks served and cooked to perfection by you on a 755-degree volcanic sizzling rock. Our concept ensures that every bite is just as hot and juicy as the first, and is always cooked just the way you like it!

This method of cooking is the newest phenomenon in the culinary world. It creates a memorable dining experience, making Black Rock the ideal restaurant for special occasions, as well as for everyday dining with friends and family.

**About Terrence Williams &amp; Cousin T's:**

Growing up in foster care, I always dreamed about big family gatherings around the breakfast table with grandma in the kitchen cooking up a big family breakfast. As a kid, I could almost smell that intoxicating aroma of those delicious hot and fluffy pancakes smothered in butter and warm maple syrup. I always told myself that one day I would make those fabulous pancakes, and as an adult, I have cultivated my love for cooking and my passion for food into my Cousin T's collection. It is my hope that there are many family conversations, laughs and lasting memories made as a result of families and loved ones joining together to eat Cousin T's pancakes. So quit reading and gather around the table and enjoy a good helping of American old-fashioned family values and a yummy and hearty meal because that's what Cousin T's is all about!

"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/oureconomy/blackrock-asset-management-economy-prediction-inflation-recession/

The working assumption, for governments and central banks across the world, is that at some point soon everything will get back to ‚Äònormal‚Äô ‚Äì our economies will return to either pre-pandemic or, sometimes, even pre-2008 crash levels.

These beliefs are reinforced by media economics commentary and across political parties.

But what if they‚Äôre wrong? The world‚Äôs largest asset manager, overseeing $10trn in assets across the globe, thinks we are, instead, entering a period of increased risk and uncertainty, defined by unavoidable recession and much higher inflation.

BlackRock ‚Äì a well-connected, influential and hugely profitable pillar of global capitalism ‚Äì made the predictions in its ‚Äò2023 Global Investment Outlook‚Äô report.

It states: ‚ÄúThe Great Moderation, the four-decade period of largely stable activity and inflation, is behind us.‚Äù

Instead, BlackRock forecasts a new regime with a ‚Äúbrutal trade-off‚Äù ‚Äì falling living standards for the many becoming profits for the few.

This reality, of a world undergoing fundamental transformations and disrupting our settled modes of existence, has so far barely entered the economic mainstream.

For BlackRock to break with this consensus might, potentially, be one of the first signs of a broader shift in how major institutions in the Western economies view the world.
Systemic chaos

Annual food inflation in the UK rose to 13.3% ‚Äì an all-time high ‚Äì last month, according to trade body the British Retail Consortium, ahead of the official government figures out later this month.

This situation ‚Äì though slightly worse in the UK due to a flawed Brexit deal and the falling value of the pound (critical as a major food importer) ‚Äì is common across the globe. Even as wholesale energy prices have dropped from their summer 2022 peak, the price of food everywhere is soaring. United Nations‚Äô forecasts show a major risk of widespread famine in the Global South over the next year, with harvests continuing to underperform.

This global spike in prices over the past 18 months was initially described by the economic establishment as ‚Äútransitory‚Äù. Then, as inflation continued remorselessly upwards, familiar explanations reappeared: notably, excessive worker power (but real wages in the Global North are still falling) and excessive printing of money through quantitative easing (but we‚Äôve been running QE since 2009).



The economic profession as a whole, and institutions such as the major central banks, have typically written down the obvious evidence of global instability as temporary factors, rather than something more systemic.

This means we‚Äôre trapped with central banks that still think pushing up interest rates to induce a recession is a smart way to bring down inflation. We have governments committed to holding down wages and salaries while allowing profits to explode.

But BlackRock believes the world is now ‚Äúshaped by supply that involves brutal trade-offs‚Äù ‚Äì in other words, the world economy is less effective at supplying goods and services than it was.

The after-effects of the pandemic have caused supply chain problems, as we all know, but they also think an ageing population means fewer workers, pushing up the cost of labour; that ‚Äúgeopolitical tensions‚Äù will disrupt global supply chains; and that the shift to net-zero carbon emissions will involve ‚Äúdemand and supply mismatches‚Äù.

Put all this together, and BlackRock thinks inflation will come down to the 2% level we‚Äôve been used to only if central banks are prepared to ‚Äòcrush‚Äô their economies into a severe recession. Since that‚Äôs unlikely, inflation will stay much higher than we are used to ‚Äì combined with a miserable recession over the next year or so.
Massive profits for the lucky few

But BlackRock‚Äôs predictions don‚Äôt cover everything.

Its report misses the longer-term effects of Covid ‚Äì both in terms of the impact on healthcare and, as we‚Äôre currently seeing, continuing waves of infection.




It also misses, critically, the wider ecological impacts of climate change, biodiversity loss and resource depletion.

It is possible to imagine a world where peace returns rapidly to Ukraine, and the subsequent disruptions to global food and fertiliser trade are reduced. It is not possible to imagine a world where climate change and ecological destruction are thrown into reverse ‚Äì indeed, some of the effects felt today, notably, biodiversity loss, are irreversible.

This twofold combination has led ecologist Nicholas Beuret to describe a ‚Äúclimate supercycle‚Äù of food shortages and rising prices running well into the future. (A recent episode of my podcast ‚ÄòMacrodose‚Äô examines the coming food shortages for UK farmers.)

And, finally, BlackRock misses the extreme profits that shortages over the last year have generated for a select few multinationals, such as those supplying oil and gas.

It's the last part that‚Äôs critical. A more unstable world affects everyone, but it will affect everyone differently.

For most of us, on the wrong side of food price hikes and extreme weather, the future is not great. But for the lucky few, shortages have been turned, through price rises, into massive profits.",BlackRock says we‚Äôre all doomed. It‚Äôs being optimistic. The world‚Äôs largest asset manager has forecast systemic economic chaos.

The U.S. unemployment rate fell to 3.5% in December after two straight months at 3.7%. According to agency analysis: The revised average hourly earnings data suggest that the Fed is slightly less worried about wages than it reported in November. November's monthly hourly earnings were revised down to 0.4% from 0.6%. Separately, the 4.6% annual rate of hourly wage growth in December was the slowest since Aug. 21. Fed funds swaps showed a further decline in bets on Fed rate hikes, now predicting a peak rate of 5.0%.

JP Morgan rose 1.91% after it will partner with ByteDance. Forbes reported that JPMorgan Chase is partnering with ByteDance to help it develop payment technology. Global users spent $3.4 billion on TikTok in 2022, up from $2 billion the year before, according to Sensor Tower, a data analytics firm. In the United States alone, that figure has more than tripled to $670 million. Bytedance reportedly hired JPMorgan Chase to streamline those transactions, improve the way payments are sent and received, and set up a centralized bank account for ByteDance's dozen products. Bytedance has also hired several JPMorgan executives to lead its global payments team.

""The American economy is very strong and well-positioned to handle tighter monetary policy... It is a possibility our rate rises could cause a recession... We're not trying to provoke and don't think that we will need to provoke a recession.""

‚Ä¢	‚Å†Jerome Powell June 22nd, 2022. ‚Ä¢	‚Å†May 2022 inflation rate: 8.60%

""During the summer months of 2021, inflation was coming down month-by-month. So that told us that our thesis that this was going to be a passing inflation shock was at least plausible... We did underestimate it, we clearly did... In hindsight, it [inflation] was not transitory.""

‚Ä¢	‚Å†Jerome Powell June 23rd, 2022. ‚Ä¢	‚Å†May 2022 inflation rate: 8.60%

""We now understand better how little we understand about inflation. This was unpredicted... We fully appreciate the pain people are going through.""

‚Ä¢	‚Å†Jerome Powell June 29th, 2022. ‚Ä¢	‚Å†May 2022 inflation rate: 8.60%

""I do not think the U.S. is currently in a recession... We're trying to do just the right amount. We're not trying to have a recession... These are not normal times. There‚Äôs significantly more uncertainty now about the path ahead than, I think, there ordinarily is and, ordinarily, it‚Äôs quite high.... We‚Äôre trying to not to make a mistake.""

‚Ä¢	‚Å†Jerome Powell July 27th, 2022. ‚Ä¢	‚Å†June 2022 inflation rate: 9.10%

""While higher interest rates, slower growth and softer labor market conditions will bring down inflation, they will also bring some pain to households and businesses. These are the unfortunate costs of reducing inflation... While the latest economic data has been mixed, in my view, our economy continues to show strong underlying momentum.""

‚Ä¢	‚Å†Jerome Powell August 26th, 2022. ‚Ä¢	‚Å†July 2022 inflation rate: 8.50%

""We have got to get inflation behind us, I wish there were a painless way to do that. There isn't... Our expectation has been we would begin to see inflation come down, largely because of supply side healing, we haven't. We have seen some supply side healing but inflation has not really come down... I think that shelter inflation is going to remain high for some time. We're looking for it to come down, but it's not exactly clear when that will happen.""

‚Ä¢	‚Å†Jerome Powell September 21st, 2022. ‚Ä¢	‚Å†August 2022 inflation rate: 8.30%

Jerome Powell did not speak throughout all of October 2022.

‚Ä¢	‚Å†September 2022 inflation rate: 8.20%

""I'm pleased that we have moved as fast as we have, I don't think we have over-tightened... We're now 18 months into this episode of high inflation, and we don't have a clearly indentified, scientific way of understanding at what point inflation becomes entrenched. If we were to over-tighten, we could then use our tools strongly to support the economy, where as if we don't get inflation under control now we are in a situation were inflation will become entrenched... I think no one knows whether there‚Äôs going to be a recession or not. And if so, how bad that recession would be.""

‚Ä¢	‚Å†Jerome Powell November 2nd, 2022. ‚Ä¢	‚Å†October 2022 inflation rate: 7.7%

""The time for moderating the pace of rate increases may come as soon as the December meeting... I do continue to believe that there's a path to a soft or softish landing... History cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy. We will stay the course until the job is done... By any standard, inflation is much too high.""

"Hey Apes, Tards, and the ones with single working brain cell. 

TL:DR Recession is here and recession is bad. Earnings reports will are what to watch for this year. Not the other data. 


I've previously stated that some industries have gone through correction last year. But others are due. I also mentioned that I don't expect a financial crash but industries correcting as a whole. Earning and cashflows will determine the loser of industries and the smaller losers. This year there will be no winners when you adjust earnings to inflation. As a matter of fact, forward guidance in most earning calls last quarter were ""negative"" or ""stagnant."" But the market and - especially blue chip stocks - trade through indices and they have been pumped. When everyone wants to put their savings into ""safe"" indices, how can you blame banks or investment firms for doing exactly that. 


But things are about to change. Real data is coming and even with PE rations staying the same prices will fall as earnings will. 


Our first sacrifice of the year WILL BE big banks and large investment firms. I have 0 doubt that banks will have small corrections after poor performances in the last quarter.

Then there are pump news that will of course pump some of these stocks after ""earnings beat."" 


&gt; The earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 13, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.

&gt; While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.


Blackrock stock has gone up 39% in the last 3 months. You can say markets are forward looking as much as you want. A drop in earnings is not priced in. 


I'm not going to write in detail about every single firm here. Just do your own research and bet wisely before earnings and after.

"Here is an example of a trend following strategy that combines several technical analysis techniques: 

Please remember this is not financial advice and bla bla bla 

Identify the trend: Use a trendline or moving average to determine the direction of the trend. For example, if the price is above a rising trendline or a 20-period moving average, the trend might be considered up.

Determine entry points: Wait for a pullback to a key level of support within the trend, such as a trendline or moving average. For example, if the trend is up and the price pulls back to a rising 20-period moving average, this could be considered a potential entry point.

Place a stop-loss order: To manage risk, place a stop-loss order at a level below the entry point. For example, if the entry point is a long position at the 20-period moving average, the stop-loss might be placed a few pips below the moving average.

Determine the target profit: Set a target profit at a key level of resistance within the trend, such as a previous high or a trendline. For example, if the trend is up and there is a previous high a few pips above the current price, this might be a potential target.

Consider using confirmation signals: Some traders may choose to wait for additional confirmation before entering a trade, such as a breakout on higher than average volume or a move above a certain moving average.
Here is an example of how this strategy might be applied in practice:

The price of EUR/USD is in an uptrend, as determined by a rising trendline and a 20-period moving average.

The price pulls back to the 20-period moving average, which is considered a key level of support within the trend.

The trader enters a long position at the 20-period moving average and places a stop-loss order a few pips below the moving average.
The target profit is set at a previous high a few pips above the current price.

If the price reaches the target profit, the trader can close the position and realize the profit. If the stop-loss is triggered, the trade is closed and the loss is limited to the distance between the entry point and the stop-loss.

It is important to note that this is just one example of a trend following strategy, and there are many other ways that technical analysis techniques can be combined to develop a trading strategy. 

Additionally, it is generally recommended to use a combination of technical and fundamental analysis, as well as risk management techniques, when developing a trading strategy.",Trading Trend Strategy For Beginners/Advanced.,1,self.wallstreetbets,1073u9k,TheAlienFX,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1073u9k/trading_trend_strategy_for_beginnersadvanced/,1673236350

"OpenAI, the developer behind artificial intelligence bot ChatGPT, was reported by multiple sources to be in discussions to raise capital at a valuation of $29B. Venture capitalists are rushing in to profit from the viral technology, including firms like Thrive Capital and Peter Thiel's Founders Fund. The transaction is being structured as a tender offer, where investors buy shares from existing holders, and would be double the $14B valuation the company received in 2021.

Snapshot: The deal is making waves in Silicon Valley, where many startups have prepared or seen big cuts to their valuations as investors pull back from new deals. The tender offer comes just a month after OpenAI released the newest form of its GPT-3.5 software. Following its launch, ChatGPT amassed 1M users in just five days, making headlines in the tech industry, just weeks after releasing image generation program Dall-E 2.

Microsoft (MSFT) is also eager to get some skin in the game (remember Tay from 2016?), holding advanced talks to increase its investment in OpenAI. In 2019, Microsoft even poured $1B into the startup and became its preferred partner for commercializing new technologies. Reports this week also suggested that it's working on a version of Bing that uses the artificial intelligence software behind ChatGPT to close the gap with search engine leader Google (GOOG, GOOGL).",AI Takeover?,1,self.wallstreetbets,10733nj,Shallow_Indeed,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/10733nj/ai_takeover/,1673234220

"I have around $200,000 that I plan to invest this year while the market is down. I will be mainly using ETF‚Äôs and I am comfortable investing it for at least 10 years. For simplicity, my target allocation is 70% SPY and 30% IJR. My plan is to utilize a combination of direct purchases with short puts to DCA over the next several months till I am fully invested. My logic around using both is that the puts will help me enter at more attractive prices while also lessening the risk of missing a rising market from direct purchases (additional premium income is secondary consideration).  I am still trying to figure out what the ‚Äúbest‚Äù approach is to accomplish this goal. Does anyone have any experience or advice using short puts to DCA into the market? A few questions I have:  
\-	If my goal is to invest an equal amount over the next 4 months, for example, should I use the same ratio of short puts to direct purchases every period? (ie short 1 put for every 100 shares I purchase each month)  
\-	Should I short puts at different strikes for same period or keep it same % strike?

"The 10-Year Treasury Yield is the most important indicator of Investor Confidence.  Why is it forgotten then?  What's the 10-Year Treasury Yield? And Why is it Important? 

Treasury Bonds are considered one of the safest, most secure investments. Because the U.S government backs it.  Treasury securities are loans to the government that range from weeks to as many as 30 years.   We will be talking about the 10-Year because it's the most prevalent

Wait wait wait  Quick Explanation  Think of Bonds like this  ""Bonds are forms of tradable debt""  The Government is the borrower, we as Bondholders are lenders

How can this help me?  Let's give you example: \*Prices for the 10-Year drop and Yields rise\*  What does this mean?  Investor confidence is high  Investors feel they can find higher-returning investments elsewhere and do not feel the need to play it safe

"# January 6 Recap

https://preview.redd.it/giwalfoc6waa1.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4d172643f5fbe6e50e4001b6de8977652805531

SPY recently ended a streak of four consecutive weeks of losses. This was accompanied by a strong upward trend and increased trading volume, both of which are considered positive indicators. The index closed near the highest point of the session, suggesting further potential for upward movement in the future.

[Market Wrap](https://preview.redd.it/9xeq9sbe6waa1.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce2ddbf41489cfa7ee2e470361574e18cf90caa3)

US stocks closed near session highs on Friday, as traders expect wage growth to slow, assisting the Federal Reserve in its efforts to combat inflation. Treasuries rose while the dollar fell. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indices both gained for the week, with the S&amp;P 500 up 1.5% and the Nasdaq 100 up 0.9%. These gains marked the end of a four-week losing streak for both indices.

The December jobs report, released on Friday, did not provide a clear indication of the state of the American labor market. Hiring exceeded expectations for the month and unemployment fell to its lowest level in decades, but there were weaker gains in hourly wages. This has led to uncertainty about the future direction of Federal Reserve policy. In light of this data, investors now expect the policy rate to peak at less than 5% this cycle, down from 5.06% just before the release of the jobs report. Traders are divided on the size of the expected rate hike in February, with 33 basis points of tightening priced in. However, a quarter-point increase appears to be more likely than a half-point increase.

# üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I SPY TA - Monday January 9, 2023

SPY recently broke out of its rectangle pattern with increased trading volume, which is a hopeful development for bulls. Last week, the level of 387 was identified as a key point for a potential breakout, and it is now important for this level to hold.

If the breakout proves to be valid, it is possible that the index may test the levels of 395 and the 200-day moving average, which is currently at 398.68.

&amp;#x200B;

* Downside levels:
   * 386.46 (20 MA)
   * 384.96
   * 377.69
   * 368.42
   * 362.16
* Upside levels:
   * 390.08
   * 395.19
   * 398.68 (200 MA)
   * 401.51

Bullish RSI divergence on the daily chart remains a viable indicator at this time. It is important that bulls maintain a position above the 20-day moving average, which is currently around the level of 387. This level will likely be tested in the coming week, and increased buying volume at or near this level could be a good sign that it will hold.

It is important to keep an eye on the 387 breakout level, as it is expected to be tested in the near term. If the breakout is successful, the first target to watch for is 393, with the second target being the 200-day moving average at approximately 396.

On the other hand, if the breakout level is not maintained, the index may retreat to the level of 382.

*Try trimming 70-80% of your positions at the closest target and slowly scaling out as you approach the rest. You can also throw in a trailing stop loss once your positions have been reduced to protect against any potential losses. By following these guidelines, you can manage risk while still allowing room for some sweet, sweet gains.*

The current support level is 387.69 and resistance is at 389.29. Upside targets are at 390.76 - 392.03 and 394.47 - 395.09, while downside targets are at 385.65 - 385.03, 383.11, and 381.50.

And now they have their party hostage and winning momentum, by stomping their foots while plugging their ears until everyone else gives up.

"Yes, you heard it correctly, if you are a beginner and you want to learn stock trading, Paper trading is the best rather than trying somewhere else.

If you are not desperate to trade by yourself, just start trading on paper whatever you learn or whatever you get from someone. You will get knowledge every day once you will start doing paper trading. I strictly recommend this because I have seen hundreds of people losing their entire money just because of limited knowledge and skill in the stock market.

It takes months to learn everything so don‚Äôt jump and trade with your hard-earned money. Just focus on learning if you have just entered the stock market rather than doing trades in your account.

I follow discipline while trading in the stock market because it‚Äôs most importantly required. The stock market is bigger and riskier for newcomers than they actually think. They are unaware of the potential loss probability behind intraday trading. They don‚Äôt have proper knowledge of intraday trading. They either follow tips providers or brokers who provide them recommendations which are giving them losses most of the time.

When the market is stable, they may earn a few bucks which gives them confidence but profit is not consistent for experienced players also so is loss amount will be always higher than the profit amount for newcomers, and in this way, they end up losing their initial capital.

Learning is a key to earning. I learned many lessons in stock trading I am mentioning a few below:

* Risk: Trading is 100% risky so if anyone tells you about Guaranteed or Assured profits, never believe in them. Trading involves high risk and it can be controlled but can‚Äôt be avoided. Risk will always remain there.
* Stoploss: Stoploss is like a shield for your capital. If you don‚Äôt wear a shield on the battlefield, you are taking a risk of your life and you may lose your life. The same thing applies in trading because if you don‚Äôt apply Stoploss to your trade, you may lose your entire money. So never hold a losing position without stop-loss.
* Profit/Loss are not Certain: Profit and loss are part of trading and nothing is certain so you have to be prepared for both. Every day is not the same and nothing is permanent so you have to be habituated to little losses too.
* Follow the Market trend: I have seen people either buying or selling one side without knowing the trend which gives losses every day. You have to follow the market trends. If the market is falling or in a bearish trend and you keep on buying, you will get failure most of the time. The same thing is on the short side. You have to trade with trends otherwise you won‚Äôt be able to gather profit.
* Over trading: I used to do too much trading in my initial trading days which gave me losses only. I learned that trading should be done sensibly not frequently. So do fewer trades which generates good profit rather than doing too many trades.
* No emotions or sentiments: Never expect from the market anything because the market doesn‚Äôt have any emotions or sentiments. Though you are in deep trouble and you want money for someone‚Äôs operation, the market will not understand your problem so never be sentimental while trading and control your emotions. Do trading like a robot who doesn‚Äôt have any emotions.
* Spare Capital: Use your spare or extra capital only for trading. Never use your primary capital which you are going to use after a few days in some emergency or other expenses. I have seen many people who use their emergency capital or that capital from which they have to pay certain fees for children or something.
* Risk Reward: Always calculate risk before entering into any trade because if you are targeting to make 10 Rs profit, your stop loss should be also 3‚Äì5 rs as per your risk appetite. Never hold any losing position without Stoploss.

" Up, down, sideways?! 

Good afternoon fellow traders!!! A pretty noneventful week last week IMO overall market wise as we were in a range most of it till an exciting Friday to bring us home!!!

I‚Äôm going to share my analysis of the SPY for the coming week to see which way we may go.

To start us off let‚Äôs remember Thursday the 12th we have CPI reports, this will likely bring some type of reaction either way from the SPY, so keep that in the back of our minds.

Starting with the micro let's analyze the price action of the last week. Below is a 6M day chart. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5sx7akppevaa1.png?width=883&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=351c682035d461c629e16c21bac253dfb1f338ca

 

The action Friday really shakes things up here. An above avg range day on above avg volume, with a strong daily candle close. 

Technically speaking this 380 level has been a line in the sand for the last 9 months. Let‚Äôs look at the chart below and see its importance.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h5n74l3uevaa1.png?width=883&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=443671ec76095e99b92bc96eb234fb9777989d05

 This 380 level, as well as 410, have been my two key levels in play for the last 9 months. As you can see 380 support was first set back in May of 2022, offering a sharp reversal back to 410 before retesting the support area of 380 once again. 

Each subsequent time we‚Äôve come down to this support area we‚Äôve had the same outcome. A reversal to the upside. The main difference between the prior times we‚Äôve spent down in this demand zone is how long until a reversal? 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/16zek28zevaa1.png?width=886&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e95aad0c4694ae3f8c262ac5c519e93ac366bc9

 The next key level we are coming into is 390. This is going to be in my opinion the place to watch whether we will go higher or lower in the coming weeks. At the very least this week I expect to test the 390 level pretty early on in the week. Either Monday or Tuesday. Depending on the price action at 390 this will give us more information on the next move. If we see some topping signs here and a failure to hold 390 then I am expecting a move such as this. 

 

https://preview.redd.it/jiv3n5k4fvaa1.png?width=883&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0808f981db0fa6abf172a970c03697079942e46e

 

However, if we can break and hold 390. Then I‚Äôll be expecting a move similar to the last few times we reclaimed 390 as support back in July as well November. If we can get a move like this then I‚Äôd expect at a minimum to test the descending trend line I‚Äôve had drawn for quite some time, at around 400. At max, a retest of the 410 area and hopefully our first higher high.

Lastly, let us look at some higher time frame weekly charts to see exactly what in my opinion may or may not be a good time for all of this to turn itself around.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/it4ojh57fvaa1.png?width=883&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1499670999ebcd376a81ba406de78eefb929900c

 

So as we can see in this weekly chart. I‚Äôve tried to portray via colors the significance of the swing highs and lows that have been set the last year. In red we have bearish trends, lower highs, and lower lows. Green ovals are our attempts of reversing this trend with either a higher high or higher low. The sole gray oval is neutral as it is yet not validated as a higher high or lower high until we see what the next attempt at it is. 

As of now, we are in the first position since last year to possibly rotate this trend and create a reversal. If we can break and hold 410 to the upside and then set a higher low to 380 after it pulls in then we will for the first time since 2021 be making higher lows and higher highs once more. What happens after that we do not know!

To wrap this up, In my opinion, I think we have some upside in the SPY earlier on in the week good for at least 2% to the 395 area. What we do after that will be key to whether or not we head higher to 400+ or see 370‚Äôs. So I will be watching mainly if we can flip and hold the 390 support once more and that will dictate my bias. 

Lastly, remember CPI numbers report Thursday which are bound to create some type of reaction in the markets. Again, in my opinion, if we come in under estimates I believe markets should rip off of that report, showing that even at Christmas time inflation can still start to fix itself and give participants hope the next Fed meeting will be good news. However, the odds of that happening may be pretty low so watch for the flip scenario to happen.

"Since the world is full of idiots, lets take away some logic to fit this DD. I promise, its for a good cause.

I look at robinhood, and in the past quarter have been exploring taking a few thousand into HOOD over the next two quarters. Robinhood is the Apple of investing. And here is why. 

**Robinhood: An idiots adventure**

When a company takes consistent steps towards gaining market share, it gets an eye from many. Robinhood is a primary ticker I think to watch this year and the next as even during this economic situation coming up, robinhood is showing solid ability to leverage their full potential. I see constant features opening doors for more accounts to open or expand their current methods. It allows for the platform to use is expertise in marketing to make you lose your money. And it's on your phone. More people from more walks of life are trading, and putting money into the platform. Reaching for Quantity while also aiming for quality. Which I will delve into below.

The aesthetic is important in life. Apple took this to a level that would have happened eventually, but of course they were first. And look at them now. The UI, ease of access, and marketing made them, and it's making HOOD. Remember, who made it easy to get and run a computer in a household? And who made it easy to open and trade for the average guy? 


**Debt, Cashflow, and other stupid numbers:** Alright fellas, we have reached the point where we start to dismantle some logic to fit this DD. It still works so try and follow. I keep hearing about debt load, cashflow, tricks, and other super intelligent things BUUUUUT A company such as this, when they take on more debt I see as a WIN and here is why; They have proven to take steps that work. I do not know how much those initiatives cost, but damn are they attracting people. So when they get more debt, I have a high expectation they will utilize that money in a great way for future investors. If someone is willing to give them money, with their track record of expansion I hope they TAKE IT.

** HOOD $8.25** 

I know nothing. I am terrible at math. But something is pulling me towards a multi year strat that has high gains possible. Where can they go but up? A backslid has happened but with consistent marketing wins and features grabbing more users this seems a fine price to get in on a secondary play. 

Where do I see it going? North of $20 but won't close the year above $30. Beyond that, it will take firm roots as core institution simply because people want them around, like what they do and how it looks. In the next ten years we must all expect something reasonable in gains but I bring you here for the 2 year look.


Q: What about (insert bank here , coinbase ) as a comparison? 
A: Shut up nerd robinhod is in a different catagory at this point with how they operate its just something I feel. Go touch some grass. Loser.

Q: Your an idiot
A: Yes I am. That isn't a question

Q: How much monies?
A: I have 20k going into the market over the next year. Day trading [F] &amp; [T] while I learn. Doing stuff with crypto on a third of my portfolio, split oon doge and btc.

Q: When did you start trading?
A: December.

Hey guys  ready for fun next week?

We've got important data from the United States, China, and Europe, including CPI and trade figures, GDP figures, and unemployment and industrial production figures coming this week.

The market is kind of in limbo right now, trying to figure out whether to worry about more Fed rate hikes or hope for an economic boost from China's reopening. The latest Fed minutes made it clear that the central bank is still committed to targeting inflation, but they also warned that market rallies could get in the way.

We'll see if the upcoming CPI release is lower than expected,. It's not clear how the market will react to softer inflation numbers, especially with the Fed being cautious about market rallies.

Although the official data hasn't shown much of an impact from recent Fed rate hikes yet, GDP probably grew at an annualized rate above 2% in Q4. But survey data is starting to show the negative effects of tighter monetary policy, especially in financial services. S&amp;P Global's PMI survey data showed business activity falling sharply in December, with financial services seeing the steepest contraction. Consumer-facing sectors and manufacturing also struggled due to rising costs of living and slowing global trade. On the bright side, tech and healthcare remained in expansion territory, but it looks like GDP growth might disappoint in the New Year.

Let‚Äôs get to the calendar.

 

# MONDAY, JAN. 9

**12:30 pm: Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic speaks**

Bostic's speech might give us some clues about what's going on with the economy and where the Fed is headed in terms of its policies. Sounds interesting, huh?

**3:00 pm: Consumer Credit Change (NOV) Forecast: $24B Previous: $27.08B**

This data release from the Federal Reserve just shows how much credit people have taken out in the past month. It's just a measure of how much people are borrowing, and it might give us some clues about consumer spending and borrowing habits.

 

# TUESDAY, JAN. 10

Jerome Powell is giving a speech on 10th? It's like, who cares, right? I mean, Powell's speeches are always such a wild card. It's like the weather - you never know what you're going to get. One minute the markets are soaring, and the next minute, BOOM, everything crashes. But hey, at least it's always entertaining.

**16:00 Fed Chair Powell Speaks (medium-high )**

**17:00 Wholesale Inventories MoM (NOV) Forecast:** 1% Previous: 0.5% (medium )

This shows us how much stuff wholesalers have in stock, and it can tell us about supply and demand in the wholesale sector. They're expecting the number to go up by 1% from last month, which was when it went up by 0.5%.

**EIA Short-Term Energy Outlook**

This report tells us what to expect in the energy market over the next few months. I know it doesn't sound very exciting, but it can give us an idea of what energy prices might do, which can affect how much we pay for things like gas and home heating. It's not the most thrilling topic, but it's worth paying attention.

 

# WEDNESDAY, JAN. 11

It's going to be a busy day for oil and bond traders, with a couple of key data releases on the calendar.

**17:30 Crude Oil Inventories**

This report shows the change in the number of barrels of crude oil held in storage in the U.S., and it can give us an idea of the supply and demand dynamics in the oil market.

17:30 Cushing Crude Oil Inventories

More crude oil inventory data? You bet! As I said, busy day for oil traders. 

**20:00 10-Year Note Auction**

Time for a little bond action!

 

# THURSDAY, JAN. 12

The busiest day of the week!

**7:00 AM - ECB Economic Bulletin: The European Central Bank** will be dropping some serious knowledge on the state of the economy. Hopefully, they won't bore us to death.

3:30 PM - Core CPI (YoY) (Dec): This release measures the change in the price of a basket of goods and services over the past year. In other words, it tells us whether stuff is getting more or less expensive. **Forecast** **5.7% Previous 6.0%**

 3:30 PM - Core CPI (MoM) (Dec): This one is similar to the YoY release, but it only looks at the change in prices over the past month. **Forecast** **0.3% Previous** **0.2%** 

3:30 PM - Core CPI Index (Dec): The Core CPI Index measures the average price of the basket of goods and services included in the Core CPI. It's kind of like the ""average temperature"" of inflation if you will.

3:30 PM - CPI (MoM) (Dec): The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of the average change in prices over time for a basket of goods and services. This particular release looks at the change in prices over the past month. **Forecast** **0.1% Previous 0.1%**

 3:30 PM - CPI (YoY) (Dec): This release is the same as the MoM version, but it looks at the change in prices over the past year. **Forecast** 6.5% **Previous** 7.1% 

3:30 PM - Initial Jobless Claims: A measure of how many people applied for unemployment benefits in the past week.

**Forecast** 220K **Previous** 204K

 8:00 PM - 30-Year Bond Auction: The government will be selling some long-term debt today. Let's hope they can find some takers, or else they might have to default on their loans. 

 9:00 PM - Federal Budget Balance (Dec): The government's financial report card for the month. 

 FRIDAY, JAN. 13

**14:30 Fed Harker Speech**

**17:00 Michigan Consumer Sentiment Prel (JAN) Forecast: 60 Previous: 59.7%**

"Teala cuts electric car prices in China and other Asian markets on Friday, part of efforts to stoke demand for output from its Shanghai plant.
Following are details of the price cuts:

CHINA
Tesla slashed prices for all versions of its Model 3 and Model Y cars in China by between 6% to 13.5%, according to Reuters calculations based on the prices shown on its website. The starting price for Model 3, for instance, was cut to 229,900 yuan ($33,427) from 265,900 yuan.

JAPAN
Tesla cut the prices of Model 3 and Model Y cars by about 10% each in Japan, the first time it had done so since 2021.

"That is all. We waste so much mental and physical energy trying to ‚Äúget rich‚Äù. You think the rich are happier, only happier than those who can‚Äôt afford basic needs. Otherwise no. I‚Äôve met and mingled with so many wealthy people and they are all druggies or alcoholics and say things like ‚Äúthat trip you think is gonna be so great is never as great as you thought‚Äù.  

So my advice is, get yourself financially stable as long as it takes but don‚Äôt make money the focus of your day everyday.  And don‚Äôt worry if you have to rent a room with someone and figure out ways to eat cheap. Just don‚Äôt let money consume you. I‚Äôve had a lot at times and it never changed the things in me that only letting go and being present (yeah I‚Äôm a Tolle fan) can do. In fact I‚Äôm selling almost everything I own.

"BABA has nearly doubled from its lowest point. All Chinese stocks have been rallying to the moon. 

Two years ago China was not viewed as uninvestable. Not much has fundamentally changed about the investment system in China. It‚Äôs still authoritarian, VIE structure, the CCP can do what it wants. It‚Äôs always been this way. Yes short term crisis like the real estate bubble and tech crack down have occurred, but China is mostly the same as it was 2 years ago. 

I‚Äôve been pounding sand for months about the amazing opportunity China presents. It was extremely undervalued even with risks considered. Now that I‚Äôve been proven right and China stocks are rocketing, will people finally end this overly pessimistic fear mongering? The choir will come out with the same tired points about how idiotic it is to invest in China. 

As of now, the naysayers have been proven wrong. BABA is performing wonderfully despite the noise. 

I just want to know how much longer the sheep will keep avoiding China before they fomo in. It‚Äôs not to late to jump into Chinas recovery. This is only the beginning of a long rally back to fair value. 

I know most commenters are going to berate me. But to the few wise ones with open minds, consider what the criticism argues vs the current price performance.
