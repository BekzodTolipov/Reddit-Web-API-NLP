"Hi All!

I really enjoyed playing Arkham LCG. I liked the fact that there was a story unfolding, the campaign etc...

The only gripe I had was with the intense deckbuilding aspect of it which took a lot of upkeep, which meant it was harder to get to the table.

"Ok, trying to figure out my next purchase. Looking for a ""dudes on a map game"" and kinda have it narrowed down to these 3 with pro's and con's for each...

**Undaunted** I would probably go for Normandy. Haven't played these yet but seem to be excellent based on reviews and my wife would enjoy it well enough but probably won't choose it if she's picking the game. The game is right up my alley. 

**Memoir 44** This is the game that would probably reach the table the most just because of it's simplicity. I'd like something a little more strategic, but I think this would be my wives favorite of the three options.

**War of the Ring** Obviously, a entirely different beast compared to the other two. And the only one of the 3 I've played. The buddy I played this with (who also owned it) moved away and that has left a hole in my heart. Of the 3 this is the one I actually want the most, but realistically the number of times it will get played is few. And my wife isn't a huge fan of the IP but would probably play it once a year or so. it's also double the cost of the other options.

"**BACKGROUND**

[Railways of the World](https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/66581/railways-world-series-introducing-family-members-i) is probably my favourite game of all time. It's hard not to be impressed the first time you see it on the table, with a game in full flow. It has the look of a miniature railroad set, as players are building and managing their own railroad networks on a massive board, delivering goods between cities in order to earn points.  But it's not just a pretty face; it also happens to be a fantastic medium-weight game, with a straight-forward ruleset, and interesting tactical and strategic decisions.

Another strength of Railways of the World is that it has a series of expansion maps which allow you to play the game in different settings. 

But there was one thing missing from the series until now: the ability to play the game solitaire. That's why it's such great news that in 2022 the publisher has released the [**Rail Barons of the World**](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/337856/rail-barons-world) expansion**.** 

**OVERVIEW**

This expansion for Railways of the World provides all the components needed to enable a solo mode for seven of the maps: Eastern US, Mexico, Portugal, Nippon, Great Britain, Sweden, and Australia. 

The solo system was created by Dávid Turczi and John Albertson, who are both highly regarded for their expertise with solitaire variants.

Given the large size of all the other boxes in the series, this one may come as a surprise. It's just a small box, containing around 150 cards. It may look small, but it packs a big punch.  There's even a bonus inclusion: universal Baron cards that can be used as point-scoring objectives for any of the maps.

**GAMEPLAY**

So how does it work?  Certain Cities and Major Lines are marked as ""Not in Play"", and a deck of ""Railbot"" cards will determine the actions of your AI opponent (which gets its own trains, in a different colour), with a row of three of these cards face-up at any given time.

Some changes to the usual gameplay are immediately obvious.  You only use two Service Bounties, and you don't use the usual Start cards from the Operations deck, or the usual Railroad Baron cards.  

There's also no turn order auction, with a turn now consisting of the following steps, with available player actions mostly working the same as in a multiplayer game:

* perform two actions
* resolve a Railbot card
* perform your third action
* gain income, pay dividends, and add a new Railroad Operations card to the display

The Railbot is easy to manage, because it doesn't use money, bonds, or an engine level, and also has no income or score.  The Railbot card to be resolved is determined randomly, and includes actions like building track links or delivering cubes between cities, exhausting goods of a particular colour, claiming major lines for the Railbot player, or requiring you to pay taxation.

At a cost of two actions, you can place an Insurance token to negate the effect of a Railbot card when it is later triggered.  You can also play with a Duel Barons variant, which makes dual-use Barons available that you can either claim for bonus points, or which can be triggered by the Railbot to produce effects harmful to you.

**IMPRESSIONS**

* **Universal Barons**: Having 24 long term goal cards that you can bring into the game instead of the regular ones can really change some of your long term strategies, and helps keep the game fresh.  They aren't the main selling feature of this expansion, but are a nice bonus inclusion.  
* **Solo system**: The real appeal of this expansion is the ability to play Railways of the World as a solitaire game. Dávid Turczi and John Albertson are the best in the business when it comes to creating satisfying solitaire variants for our favourite games, and they have done a fantastic job with this one. It's easy to learn and smooth to play.
* **Familiar experience**: Even though the solo system is effectively an AI, the overall feel of gameplay remains the same, and captures much of the experience of a multi-player game. You're still building track and moving goods, while managing finances, and trying to accomplish short and long-term objectives. So the core of gameplay is retained.
* **Card management**: One thing that the AI does particularly well is management of the Railroad Operations Display. It's limited to just five spaces, which can be further reduced by Deadhead from the Railbot. The Railbot cards also work very well to force links to be created by the Railbot player, simulating an opponent, and from time to time this also requires removing cubes, which can lead to cities being emptied. The Insurance action is a nice touch to help protect you against particularly harsh effects.
* **Varied maps**: Not all the expansion maps are supported, but the vast majority are: Eastern US, Mexico, Portugal, Nippon, Great Britain, Sweden, and Australia. That gives plenty of scope to play solo on a range of different maps.
* **Adjusting difficulty**: The rules also provide ways to adjust the difficulty in several ways, in order to make the game easier or harder. This is another welcome feature of the solitaire system.
* **Good components**: The cards all have a linen finish, and their quality and graphic design matches the base game and expansions.  I found it most practical to store the cards for the different expansions along with those boxes, otherwise it's a tight fight back into the compact box.

**Recommendation:** If you enjoy the Railways of the World series, and enjoy playing solitaire versions of your favourite games, then this is a no-brainer. Dávid Turczi and John Albertson are the perfect team to produce a solo system, and have done a fantastic job in implementing Railways of the World as a solitaire experience.  While it won't quite match the fun of playing with other players, it is a superb solitaire implementation of a superb game.  Highly recommended for Railways of the World fans.

"Hey folks, I'm looking for playtesters for my game called Passing Muster: Landscknecht.

It’s a drafting card game for 2 to 6 players where you play a corrupt colonel in the Holy Roman Empire in the Renaissance era. Your goal is to muster up a warband for an upcoming campaign, but keep as much of the money you were given to do it as possible. But, you can’t win the game if every one of your opponents has a stronger warband then you - that would leave you in disgrace.

So, you’re building a tight, economical engine throughout the game while trying to throw spokes into the wheels of the other player’s engines.

If you play, or simply take a look at the rules/the TTS mod, let me know what you think. (All art is prototype obviously)

"Hi all,

This question is more for my fellow Canadians. 

Where does everyone get their board game organizers?

I have a couple of games that need better organizing, but the buying options seem very limited in Canada.

I’ve narrowed my choices to three brands:
- Broken Token
- LaserOx
- Tower Rex (Etsy)

I prefer the wood look and feel for organizers and want to avoid foam and plastic. 

I would prefer to buy from a local (Toronto) store, but that doesn’t seem to be an option. Does anyone have any experience buying from these companies?

Hi everyone: 

I used to post a COMC every year to keep track of the collection changes, last year I took the photo but forget to write the post, so here we go.  Here are the pictures of the colletion current state: [https://imgur.com/a/FoRiSB3](https://imgur.com/a/FoRiSB3)

This will be my 7th year in the hobby, currently the collection number is at 170. Last year I acquire “just” 17 games so I think the trend is down.  

My most recent acquisitions are **Splendor Duel** (currently on its way), **London** (I’ve wanted it for ages), and two Star Wars themed games: **Clone Wars**  (I'm a big fan of the pandmic games and also of Star Wars, so this one was the perfect mix) and **Jabba’s Palace e** (this one was a recommendation that I hear in VisLudica (Spanish podcast) and twist a bit the classic **Love Letter**).  

I think my favorite games still are **The Castles of Burgundy** (there is always something to do in your turn and at the end of the game you’re always short 1 or 2 actions to complete all your plans), **Concordia** (an elegant design, play a card and do what the card says, the score can be nuanced enough for new players, but with some examples here and there it’s manageable ) and **Trajan** (love the mancala and the mini games, this one have the most combos and I really love combos in games). The games that I want to explore more are **London** (an engine builder where the engine components are mostly single use), **Bonfire** (one of the latest Feld games, the art and theme are a bit peculiar, but the mechanics are strong), **Macao** (Love the decision between keep the cubes I need now, or most cubes for later turns, the cards add enough randomness for my taste) and **Kokopelli** (an interactive Feld with combos, lot of combos and cards, lots of cards that alter the rules in an intuitive way). 

As you can see in the pictures, mid-weight euros are my type of games. Since I played **The Castles of Burgundy: The Card Game** Stefan Feld became my favorite designer. I backed the City Collection first 4 games (but have been so disappointed with the campaign, the price, the art and the deluxification) and the special edition of **The Castles of Burgundy** (Yes, CoB needed a better production but I think the castle miniatures were unnecessary), unfortunately neither have arrived, yet. Stefan Feld is one of my exceptions with crowdfunding, but I’m more an old-soul and have been lucky and have grabbed copies of **Macao**, **Bruges** and **Aquasphere** which are very rare in my country. I’m in the mission of obtain a copy of **In the Name of the Rose**, **Strasbourg** and  **Bruges: City of the Zwin**. 

In the last year I have re-appreciated Reiner Knizia’s designs, usually his games are simple to play but with a nice amount of depth. As you can see, I have been more inclined to get old games than the newer games, so I’m proud owner of **Tigris and Éufrates** (need to play it more, a lot more), **Taj Mahal** (maybe the less intuitive Knizia game), **Trough the Desert** (so simple, but with crucial decisiones here and there), **Schotten Totten** (a nice twist in **Lost Cities** formula), **Stepenson’s Rocket**, **Modern Art**, **Ra** and **Medici** (I ordered the last two games from Amazon Japan). I know is impossible to collect al Knizia games, but I’d like to have **The Quest for el Dorado** and **Samurai.** 

I’m an avid BG Stats user, I’ve logged 176 plays in 2021 and 251 plays in 2022. Most played games in last two years are **Ticket to Ride: London** (since I got it its our Ticket to Ride experience to go), **SCOUT** (this game have been a hit with every group, probably one of my favorite card games), **Medici** (It isn’t my favorite actions game nor my favorite Knizia game, but somehow it’s easy to get it to the table) and **The Castles of Tuscany** (with similar sensations tu Burgundy, this one deserves its own praise, rulebook is a mess and both Feld and Alea just forget it in BGG forums, but it’s very good and very easy to learn). 

I try to be more a player than a collector, my shelf of opportunity have hittied zero some times last months, currently is at 2: **La Granja** (I got it because I enjoy game with multi use cards like **San Juan** and **Bruges)**  and **Brass Birmingham** (I hope I like it because the BGG top 1 must be a true euro game, jokes aside, I enjoy the economic system in **Power Grid** and the Brass’ iron clays are better than the Power Grid’s paper money). 

The space will be scarce soon, so I don’t dislike the idea of getting ride some games, the candidates to be purged are **Dominion** (my copy isn’t in Spanish and that’s a problem here), **Fórmula D** (time ago I got a lot of race games and now I think I got a lot of them: **Cubitos**, **Jamaica**, **Flamme Rouge** and maybe **The Quest for el Dorado**), **Deus** and **Seasons** (since I enjoyeda lot **Wingspan** and **Res Arcana** I guessed more heavy-card games will be good, but Deus and Seasons haven’t been played since 2020!), **The King is Dead** (I really have tried to like this one, but I continue without finding what others like about it, elegant design but too meh for me), **Pax Pamir** and **Root** (I think I have all Root and still I just have played the base game, since with Pax Pamir, one play and it have been collecting dust, nevertheless great games, but I think they are better with repeated plays and I like to play a lot of games a couple of times than a couple of games a lot of times). 

We’ll, this is my collection and a more than expected description of it. Hopefully I remember to write the COMC next year, in order to see the changes and check my state in the hobby. If you want to know more about a game, please feel free to ask. 

Also, here are the COMCs and pictures of last years:

"We met playing board games, but recently, I've found myself just wanting to quit games that she's a part of for no discernible reason. A move that would elicit no comment or feeling from someone else doing it, makes me want to concede when they do it.  


I first started to notice it last month during a game of Great Western Trail, that everyone had agreed we didn't want to take too long with. I made a lot of mistakes that game and came in last out of 3, but she was able to pivot into my strategy at the very last moment, I was focusing on buildings, she was focusing on cows. she was able to build the biggest building the turn after I was able to, making me feel like it was a wasted game, as everything I did, she did better.  


It's been happening in every game since, any strategy she could pick I just feel is cheap and cheesy by virtue of her picking it, even though others will play similar strategies and not bother me.

if i bought another brand on amazon that is highly rated (i see titanshield, ultra Pro , dragon shield, appollo, ryker - there are sooo many) in the standard size the same as the fantasy flight supply, will they look identical and same size so i can just buy the remaining that i need?

It was a small Japanese card game with simple wooden figures…a bed and/or a bathtub, an animal maybe a horse or a duck or something?

"So for context, Everdell has been a game I've been wanting to play forever now. Last night I played with 3 other players so it was a 4 player game with everyone being completely new to the board game. Our very first game took 3 hours and 20 minutes and the main deck ran out of cards. I managed to set up an engine where every time I played a critter or construct, I drew a card and if it was a construction, then I also generated a resource. Iirc, it was Historian  + Courthouse and I had the Dungeon and Ranger.
Everyone else was in Autumn meanwhile I was in Summer playing card after card and I haven't even deployed my meeples because I kept getting resources as I played cards.

Everyone had a lot of fun though it took a lot longer than I expected it would. I ended up winning with 68 points. So overall, excellent first impressions but I hope the 3 hour game was just a crazy lucky scenario and not the norm. I expected 1 hour and 30 minutes end we ended up staying up till 2:20 am.

"I keep seeing people bringing up eBay prices in the discussions of whether something is worth purchasing/reselling, so I figured I'd throw in my two cents to hopefully help others save a few bucks as many don't seem to be aware there's better options.

Ebay has notoriously high prices for any OOP/KS game/expansion, and should be your last resort, not first. You also should search for what games actually sold for (check ""sold own"") rather than their listing price, as often sellers accept a suggested lower price.

Generally, the cheapest place to buy games secondhand are your local/national boardgames buy and sell groups on Facebook (not marketplace, it's full of scammers). Most countries have their own groups, but there are also EU-wide ones. I probably bought close to 60+ games that way and never once had a problem as those groups are made up of enthusiasts like yourself, but use common sense and always ask for pictures and reverse Google them just in case.

Then there's [BGG marketplace](https://boardgamegeek.com/market?pageid=1), where you can also find plenty of games for decent prices, placed somewhere between Facebook and ebay in terms of cost. You can just go to any game's page on BGG and see if there's any copies of it for sale further down, as well as price history and subscribe to it (edit notification settings to only items for sale) to watch new items alert.

*Always* use PayPal goods and services option when paying for games rather than friends and family/bank transfer, despite the extra fee, as that gives you buyer protection.

Only as the last resort, or if you really don't trust strangers/hate money, use ebay. There are some occasional good deals on there but they are few and far between. KS games that you'll see selling for $500 on ebay can likely be bought for couple hundred less on Facebook/BGG.

"[Games from the Cellar](https://cellargames.com) \- Conversations about Board Games

The panel for Games from the Cellar has been gaming together since 2009. In that time, we've played hundreds of games; sometimes more than once! Does this make us actually qualified to talk about games? Who knows, but we have thought provoking conversations anyway.

Our episodes focus solely on the spotlight game - we do not do news, new releases, or a what-did-you-play-this-week. 

We currently have 10 published episodes, and we run quite the gamut of games! We have covered Board Gaming classics such as [Primordial Soup](https://www.cellargames.com/episodes/primordial-soup), [Thebes](https://www.cellargames.com/episodes/thebes), [Acquire](https://www.cellargames.com/episodes/acquire), &amp; [Alien Frontiers](https://www.cellargames.com/episodes/alien-frontiers); New Classics such as [Azul](https://www.cellargames.com/episodes/azul) &amp; [Biblios](https://www.cellargames.com/episodes/biblios); and some of the New Hotness such as [Ark Nova](https://www.cellargames.com/episodes/ark-nova) &amp; [Mosaic: A Story of Civilization](https://www.cellargames.com/episodes/mosaic-colon-a-story-of-civilization). We also try to highlight other great games that you might not be familiar with, such as the GMT Racing Game [Thunder Alley](https://www.cellargames.com/episodes/thunder-alley) &amp; what the panel considers to be the most under-rated game of 2015, [Wings for the Baron (Second Edition)](https://www.cellargames.com/episodes/wings-for-the-baron) (a phenomenal year for gaming, by the way).

"Just before Christmas I went to see a gaming friend and taught him Splendor Duel, a game I'd played a number of times already. He then went on to beat me five straight times in a row which was a fun but chastening experience.

After the first couple of times, I tried looking at the game from different angles to see if I could see what I was doing wrong or, perhaps more accurately, to see what I could be doing better. Whatever I spotted, I was clearly wrong as it didn't help at all!

As a general rule, this kind of thing puts me off more abstract games like Splendor Duel because I find it very hard in abstracts to see where a problem is and improve it. To give a crude example if you're playing Twilight Struggle for the first time, and you put influence in Egypt before you learn there's a card that fills Egypt with USSR influence, you'll know the next time you play that, as a general rule, it's a bad idea to manually put influence in Egypt. You can see exactly the mistake you made and exactly what's needed to correct it.

But with abstract/efficiency games that kind of exercise is impossible. There's no one point at which you made an error you can learn from. In fact, the only real feedback you get is that you lost, so it's very hard to pinpoint what you did wrong and what you need to do better.

Or should I buy the first edition for a reasonable price now from my friend and just play that one ?

Also, i would also like to print the game mat that he made ([elliewaffles genshin tcg mat](https://www.tumblr.com/elliewaffles/703527765215936512/genshin-impact-genius-invokation-tcg-game-mat)) and for that i found this website that allows custom size [yourplaymat](https://www.yourplaymat.com/products/custom-size-playmat). 

The only thing is that i dont want to order the game mat if the cards wont fit in the specials slot made for them.

"Hi all  


My wife and I meet with some friends about once a month for a pot luck and board game session. Though everybody enjoys playing games together, it is safe to say I am the only one that is seriously into the hobby and it typically falls on me to provide all the games for the session, which I am generally happy to do. However, there are 8 people in this group including myself, and whilst not everybody is always able to attend, we typically have between 6-8 people there every time.  


I have games that can cater to this number, but I am getting a little tired of playing the same games each time, and don't necessarily want to spend money on games to play with this larger group, when I have a smaller, more serious game group that meet more frequently.  


As such, I was wondering if anybody has had any luck playing games intended for a smaller player count, but with more people, likely in teams? I was imaging possibly something like Quacks, with two people sharing a bag and taking turns to pull tokens from it. I have a few games I think could be adapted in this way, but my wife remains skeptical.

"I'm new to Robinson Crusoe and have been reading over the rules (I own the second edition or whichever the most recent English edition is), and played a few games. So far it's been really fun and I've enjoyed it, but I did come across another question I'm confused about:

The Carpenter's ability: economical construction  


1. Is this an ability that can be used by any character, as long as the Carpenter spends the determination tokens to activate it? If not, can this also be used if the Carpenter is in the ""support"" role, stacked with someone on top? I was under the impression that most abilities can only be used by the character themselves, so I'm confused as to when you can actually use this (like say if the Soldier, either with support of the Carpenter or by themselves as as single pawn, goes out to increase weapon durability, is this possible?).  


2. Is it possible to build something from zero wood? Say you use economical construction and increase weapon durability, is that a correct action? In the rule book I think it says you can do this and gives an example, but the reason I'm a little confused is I didn't know if you actually need 1 wood in the available resource pile, EVEN if you aren't going to stack it with the pawn doing a action.  


3. Lastly, if the success of the dice roll fails, do you get to keep your two determination tokens you spent on this ability, or are they lost? And if you do get to keep them, does that mean that you end up with 4 total determination tokens? (Since you didn't get a victory roll, you would get the two determination token role).

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to study this myself by looking up answers online, and there were some I think on BoardGameGeek but they were old posts, and it seemed like there was a lot of debate about this ability (and others). Now that it's years later I thought maybe there was more clarification on how this stuff works. I may have misunderstood as well or missed the answers.

"Hello all, Im a professional game designer and been revving up into researching deck building and table top game RPGs for a game Ive been working on that combines the aspects of both, a more open world frame that's closer to the deck building format of building your character like a deck over multiple sessions instead of a few hours, and many other general aspects still possibly in the air.

So about 6 years back I lived with my mom and went to a neighbors house to hang out. he got a new board game (I don't think it was new at the time just new to him) that he wanted to play I and for about a week now I've been trying to find it and cant figure out what to search to do so. to what I remember it was a fantasy game where you got to choose between different races I think it was a max of 4 players (only me and my friend played so its hard to remember that part). it was some type of war capture game with either mini figures or cardboard photos. the board was one big piece I think it was more rectangular then square I don't think it was a dice game it could have been a action per turn game. it was also in a big box like half torso size but I was like 14 so... it was a longish game I think we played about 3 times in 3 hours with messing around included. this is at most all I can remember I just feel if I see the board or the box I will remember it.

"Hello!

I love this game. I used to play it a bunch as a kid, but haven't played it in a really long time until yesterday when my two friends and I picked it back up and played a couple rounds.

We got into a big disagreement at one point. Here's the issue:

Once BS is called one player will inevitably wind up having to pick up the stack of cards. Since it was just the three of us, there were a few times when that stack was fairly large - 15-20 cards or so. How I have always played it, how I'm reading on all the sites explaining the rules, and how I was explaining last night, was that once the cards are picked up, the game continues as is and the following players can announce/throw down their cards and keep playing once the challenge is resolved (meaning whether the BS was correct or not).

So: if the player to my right gets BS'd and has to pick up 20 new cards, I can immediately call ""2 kings"" or whatever, play two cards, then the player to my right can call ""one ace"" and play a card, etc etc, and nobody sits around and waits for anything.

What my friends are arguing, is that gameplay must be paused once a stack is picked up until that player organizes their new cards, and gameplay can continue only once that player decides to call or not call BS on the immediate play following them.

This doesn't make sense to me, not only because I've never played that way nor read it anywhere, but also that's part of the game of BS, is if either you're BS'ing and get caught, or call BS wrongly - you get screwed. You don't get the leniency of all other players waiting on you sorting your cards to continue.  


I really don't think they're correct; I'm 100% certain I'm giving them the correct rules, but for any game we play they live and breath by the technicalities.","Niche Question about the card game ""Bullshit"" (""BS"", ""bologna"", etc)",1,self.boardgames,106z5zh,dontjello,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/106z5zh/niche_question_about_the_card_game_bullshit_bs/,1673223647

"Once a week we play ""Detective: A Modern Crime Story"" with wife and daughter, a game where you progress your case by drawing cards with short paragraphs, photos and other ""trails"". Once you read the card  you decide what to do next, you draw chosen card and so on. 

So, we're doing some digging in police archives, going through files of an old case from the 60's and there we find a few photos. One presents a pendant, given by one of the suspects to his wife, and all of a sudden my daughter says that a few weeks ago she got this pendant from my wive's mother. She brought it and our minds got blown away a bit, as it turned out to be exactly the same pendant!

"Have you ever done what I‘d call „game master cheating“? Let me elaborate what I mean:

Today I played a pretty tense game of Aeons End and some time in we were in a rather good looking spot. Then, the Carapace Queen got a double turn and flooded her board with her little helpers so much and then swarmed out, that we would have lost instantly without having any agency. As I took the role of the „game master“, reading the cards out loud, I realized what was gonna happen and changed SPECIAL 2 to SPECIAL 1, saving us from losing. Effectively, that was cheating, but I felt like it would have been a very bad way of losing and this way, we could continue on with a game that remained tense until the very end.

So this is what I mean by game master cheating. Of course I wouldn’t do this in a competitive game, but I think it‘s justifiable in a coop game.

On other versions of the game this classification is made by artists, however as far as I know on this one all paintings come from the same artist. I also sawn thar on the first edition of Gege this classification is made by type of painting (portrait, nature, etc.) But that doesn't seem to be the case of this version. This might be clear on the rulebook however my chinese is not great, and I have mostly being exposed to simplified characters, not traditional ones.

Just to be clear, I do know how to play the game and I am not asking any questions regarding the mechanics.

"Played for the first time and got the ‘set the house on fire’ haunt.  Seems impossible for anyone but the traitor to win.  Am I wrong?

The traitor doesn’t take fire damage, and those damn mannequins can move 6 spaces or two dice worth (at least one room if line of sight) - then they have 7 might?!?  Had the haunt happen quick and within the 2nd traitor turn they wiped us out.

The fire seems to spread slow and the traitor actually opened new rooms which makes it seem like it would be impossible to ever catch the whole house on fire. 

Even if the traitor can’t open new rooms so what they just sit still or move through the fire - either way they don’t take burn damage but you do, and they have a buff against physical damage so even if we tried to fight it’s a losing battle.

If this played out longer we would have taken fire damage as well trying to move through the rooms which would again make it impossible especially with the monsters.  They only get stunned and that happened with one monster once because of a freak roll, but then the other ones one their turn wiped out 2/3 of our characters.

"**Hello fellow board game enthusiasts!**

My name is Gavin and I am a software developer. I am excited to introduce my new board game app, Domo, [which is now available on Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.enesien.domo&amp;hl=en_NZ&amp;gl=US). In the near future, it will also be available on iOS, and if there's enough interest I can publish a web-based version, too.

I came up with the idea for Domo as a high school project, but until now I never had the means to bring it to life. I am thrilled to finally be able to share it with you.

Domo is a strategy board game that combines elements of chess and checkers, but with a couple unique twists, including a hexagonal board. This adds an extra layer of strategy and complexity to the game.

If you enjoy strategy games like chess and checkers, I think you will really enjoy Domo. I would love to hear your feedback and suggestions for improvements, as well as any bug reports. Positive reviews are greatly appreciated, especially this early on in the app's life.

If you do encounter any issues with the app, please don't leave a negative review. Instead, I would appreciate it if you could contact me directly so that I can address any problems and work to improve the app. Your feedback is valuable to me and I want to ensure that everyone has a positive experience while playing Domo.

*Note: I'm working solo on this project so I'll do my best to address issues as soon as possible. I've only ever tested this game with family and friends, so... \*fingers crossed\*!*

Thank you for your interest in Domo and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!

Godspeed!

\- Gavin

"We recently played QD for the first time and had a two player game. However the rules are not clear on mechanics differences for two person games other than grid size. 

We were unsure of what is considered a ”round” since each player gets to place two tiles. This was especially confusing when a single player had two turns in a row (the kings are on the top two and bottom two tiles). 

Specific questions: 

1. Can you place up to 4 knights (up to 2 per each tile placed) or do you need to decide which tile placement (1st or 2nd tile you’ll use for the knights. 

2.  If you gain knights from a building on your first tile, can you use them while placing the second tile (within the same round of 4 tiles)

3. Can a single person buy 2 buildings (once during each tile placed) and is the building bonus activated for the next tile placement within the same round of 4 tiles or do you have to wait until the next set of 4 tiles?

4. Can the dragon eat 2 buildings - this is the main mechanic that breaks down if you can do the top two twice but not this one? If yes, does each player get to pick one or would it max out based on the first two moves, even if the same player has the first two moves?",Questions about Queendomino mechanics for 2 player game,1,self.boardgames,106kr9u,ilithia12,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/106kr9u/questions_about_queendomino_mechanics_for_2/,1673188746

##FAQ

**I live in Guatemala/Canada/Jamaica/USA, why are you posting on a Saturday?!**

Because I'm writing this from Europe in the future where it's already Sunday. Timezones be crazy.

**Why are there a bunch of non-board games in the board game list?**

Because the Tabletop games category on Kickstarter includes anything remotely related to board games and sometimes things slip through my filters.

**Why is this future award winning board game and literal saviour of humanity missing from your list?**

Sometimes my filters get a bit overzealous and discard actually valid projects. If you feel something is missing for this reason, leave a comment and I'll add it (maybe).

**Can I donate all my money to you?**

No

**Can you help me promote my game?**

Please no. I make lists. Nothing more.

**Your list is full of errors and now I cnat spel amymor!**

Indeed, this fine piece of code runs purely on hope and dreams, so anything can happen. Leave a comment and I'll see what I can do.

"Did anything change in your relationship with games over the last year?

Many people experience similar entries into the board gaming hobby. You play a modern board game and really enjoy it. You play more and like them all. You buy more games and keep enjoying. You buy more than you probably should chasing the excitement of the new hobby. You start watching online content learning about different types of games. You soon see your collection of 50+ games and realise board gaming is a lifestyle for you now.

Over time I'm sure we all reach different conclusions on how we feel about games my after several years in the hobby. Games we used to love we find average as we move onto other things.

But is there anything you see over the last year where you see a real change in yourself.

For me over the last year I have felt there is very little new coming out that I need to own. But I am happy with that as I feel that is because I have enjoyed the hobby for years and have played a variety of games. Kickstarter plastic I have bought plenty of and sold on. So new Kickstarter games are often an easy pass for me as I don't have FOMO. I see the latest T game and think I don't need this as it's similar to the one I own. I bought one game released in 2022 and have pre-ordered one other.  

2022 was the year I looked at new games and said i don't need to own that new game as I have something already that fits a similar niche. 2022 was the year that I lost FOMO in my relationship with board games.",What did you learn about your relationship with gaming in 2022?,1,self.boardgames,106ekaw,mhowes92,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/106ekaw/what_did_you_learn_about_your_relationship_with/,1673168340

"From the recommendation of Shut Up &amp; Sit Down, I purchased Scout. I have not yet played the game with more than two players (which I am very excited to do!!), but I tried it out tonight with my gf, and were left a bit confused.

After playing it multiple times with incorrect rules, we finally figured out the rules with the help of this thread on BGG:  [2 player rules for the Oink version | BoardGameGeek](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2799081/2-player-rules-oink-version). The main thing about this that bothers me is that you only have three scouts for an entire round??? According to this, if you scout you have to move a scout token to the center of the table and your opponent does not get a scout token. If this is the case you only have three scout tokens per round, which there are only 2 of in a 2 player game!!! So in my experience it is very difficult to finish the round by emptying your hand and you end up with maybe 10 points if you had an amazing hand.

So what's up with this? Am I missing something? We played one game before we fully understood the rules where you give your opponent a scout token when you scout, and it felt much better than this. Any and all input is appreciated!

"I have been reviewing all of them and I'm indecisive about getting 878 vs 1754 (I have already discarded 1775 as its quite similar but a bit less meaty/deep than 1754):

- Theme: 878 is a bit more interesting to me
- Gameplay: 878 factions are kind of more interesting in terms of being asymmetric whereby both teams have different objectives: English defend and vikings attack vs in 1754 were French and English are doing the same: conquering each others territory, although the addition of the ""3rd faction"" (natives) in 1754 is very interesting 

The downside I see on 878 is double: 1) some ppl complain that the game is unbalanced (towards the Vikings) and 2) it seems to me that without the Viking Age expansion (where several of the contained modules seem to just add extra fiddliness...even SU&amp;SD review recommends skipping it altogether) the vanilla game has less depth (mechanics) than 1754

"I love Blood Rage. The mood, the minis and the design are so cool....except the last two times I played it it felt like it was flat, one dimensional and not really a thought evocative game. Tonight was the first time I played with 5 players and granted we were rusty and the set up took a while thanks to KS stuff but it just felt...disappointing and flat to the point that I'm thinking of selling it for other games.

I'm not sure if it's because I tried other games that do area control better (oh hi Inis) or if it's because Blood Rage was my intro to board games and now I know exactly what I want from a game but I'm disappointed by it and I feel bummed that I am.

"Hi! As the title reads I'm in the process of creating a game and would like to ask a question to help me with that process.

So, for starters: I already have some rules and systems in mind, but I don't want to share them yet since I haven't actually ""tested"" most of them. I may get into them a bit deeper if anyone's interested, but for this post I'm just gonna share the basics. I'll go to other subreddits later to delve further into what I have though.

Also, just to make it clear: I don't plan on selling this. I'm just gonna put it on TabletopSimulator, create a Print&amp;Play version of it and share it with a small internet community. It's just a casual fun lil' proyect. Also *also* I might add...I don't play board games. It's not that I don't like them I just don't have anyone to play with. That's the main reason why I'm struggling to design this and wanted to ask for help xD

So, the ""basic concepts"" (or should I say the self-imposed requirements) are the following: 

1. The game revolves around characters, so they need to be the core of the gameplay.
2. The game needs to have LOTS of character cards, like, around 400 or so, maybe more. 
3. The game revolves around simple combat, and every card has (6) attributes corresponding to the character on the card and nothing else gameplay-wise. This, however, can change. I'm open to adding more stuff to them, but nothing too complicated like TCG-style card effects or descriptions. They need to stay simple and 'standard'.
4. For reasons that I can get into a bit deeper if you ask, I CANNOT integrate an 'attack/defense' system or any sort of magic system, even if that's the most intuitive thing to do for character-card driven games.
5. In terms of actual gameplay I want it to be simple. Less like a ""proper"" board game and more like UNO (...but not literally like UNO, of course) if that makes sense. 
6. I'd like it to be for 2-4 players, but I'd be okay if it ends up being 2 player only.

Now, with all of this being said, my main question is:

1. **¿Is there any already existing card/board game that is similar to what I'm describing (So I can take inspiration from it)?**

...that's pretty much it. Sorry if this post is a bit out of the ordinary.

"Below is a little transcript of a game of No Thanks! I tried playing with the ChatGPT AI.
Despite it getting turns mixed up, some rules wrong (and [b]rage quitting![/b]), I was impressed that it successfully sourced the game rules and could present the turn-by-turn structure and provide some game info when prompted.
With further refinement &amp; learning we could potentially be playing our favourite boardgames against competent AI bots! Thoughts?

I'm going to try again to see if I can get a proper game played.
I'll post the session reports on BGG. (https://boardgamegeek.com/blog/12240/steve-vs-chatgpt)

*---Transcript---*

ME:
*--- Hey ChatGPT do you know the card game ""No Thanks""?*

ChatGPT:
**Yes, I am familiar with the card game ""No Thanks."" It is a board game in which players try to avoid taking certain cards, while still trying to get the lowest score possible. The game is played with a deck of cards, each of which has a number on it. Players take turns either taking the top card from the deck or placing a token on the card to indicate that they do not want it. The player with the lowest score at the end of the game wins. Do you have any specific questions about the game or how to play it?**

ME:
*--- No, I've played the game hundreds of times, lets start the game.*

ChatGPT:
**Sure! I'm happy to play a game of ""No Thanks"" with you. Just to confirm, the rules are as follows:

The game is played with a deck of cards numbered 3 through 35, and a supply of tokens.
Each player starts the game with 11 tokens.
The game is played in rounds. On your turn, you can either take the top card of the deck or place one of your tokens on the card, indicating that you do not want it.
If you take the card, you must add it to your hand, and you must also add up the value of all the cards in your hand (for example, if you have cards with values 3, 7, and 10, your score would be 20).
If you do not want the card, you place a token on it and the next player must decide whether to take the card or not.
The game ends when the deck is empty, at which point the player with the lowest score wins.
Is this correct? If you have any questions about the rules, just let me know. Otherwise, we can begin the game.**

ME:
*--- I just told you I've played hundreds of time. Were you not listening?*

ChatGPT:
**I apologize if it seemed that way. I wanted to make sure that we were on the same page regarding the rules of the game, as it can be helpful to have a clear understanding of how the game is played before starting. If you are familiar with the rules and would like to begin the game, we can do that now. Just let me know if you are ready to start and we can begin with you taking the first turn.**

ME:
*--- I am ready, lets do this.*

ChatGPT:
**Very well! It is your turn to start the game. You have the option to either take the top card of the deck, or place one of your tokens on the card to indicate that you do not want it. Remember, if you take the card, you must add its value to your score, but if you do not want the card, you must place a token on it and the next player must decide whether to take it or not. What would you like to do on your turn?**

ME:
*--- It would be helpful if you flipped over the first card.*

ChatGPT:
**Sure! The first card is a 17. Would you like to take it or place a token on it to indicate that you do not want it? Remember, if you take it, you must add its value to your score.**

ME:
*--- Hmmm, 17 is no good. ""No Thanks""*

ChatGPT:
**Very well, you have decided to place a token on the card to indicate that you do not want it. It is now my turn. I have the option to either take the 17 or place one of my tokens on it. I think I will also place a token on the card, indicating that I do not want it. The next player will now have the option to take the 17 or place a token on it.**

ME:
*--- It's not a token, its a chip.*

ChatGPT:
**I apologize for the mistake. In the game ""No Thanks,"" players use chips to indicate that they do not want the current card. The chips are placed on the card and the next player must then decide whether to take the card or place a chip on it as well. It is now the next player's turn. What would you like to do?**

ME:
*--- I am player 1. My name is Steve.
   You are player 2.
   Who is player 3?*

ChatGPT:
**I apologize for the misunderstanding. I am just a computer program, so I am not able to physically play a game of ""No Thanks"" with you. However, I can assist you in understanding the rules and strategy of the game, and I can play through a game with you by taking turns making moves based on your input. If you would like to continue playing a game of ""No Thanks,"" I am here to assist you. Just let me know what you would like to do on your next turn and we can continue the game.**

ME:
*--- Didn't you just play an action on turn 2 of the game? You placed a chip on the card.*

ChatGPT:
**I apologize for any confusion. As a computer program, I do not have the ability to physically play a game of ""No Thanks"" with you. I am simply here to assist you and provide information about the game. I can provide explanations of the rules and strategies, and I can also play through a game with you by taking turns making moves based on your input. If you would like to continue playing a game of ""No Thanks,"" I am here to assist you. Just let me know what you would like to do on your next turn and we can continue the game.**

ME:
*--- Okay then. Can you just play a random decision for player 3?*

ChatGPT:
**Certainly! As player 3, I will randomly decide whether to take the 17 or place a token on it. I have chosen to place a token on the 17. It is now your turn again, Steve. You have the option to either take the 17 or place a token on it to indicate that you do not want it. Remember, if you take it, you must add its value to your score. What would you like to do?**

ME:
*--- Please give yourself a random name. And a random name for player 3 too.*

ChatGPT:
**Very well. As a computer program, I do not have a physical name, but I can assign myself a random name for the purposes of this game. I will now be known as ""ChatGPT the Great."" As player 3, I will also assign myself a random name, ""Helen."" It is now your turn, Steve. You have the option to either take the 17 or place a token on it to indicate that you do not want it. Remember, if you take it, you must add its value to your score. What would you like to do?**

ME:
*--- No Thanks*

ChatGPT:
**Very well, you have chosen to place a token on the 17. It is now Helen's turn. As player 3, Helen has the option to either take the 17 or place a token on it to indicate that she does not want it. Remember, if Helen takes the 17, she must add its value to her score. What would you like to do, Helen?**

ME:
*--- You decide for Helen.*

ChatGPT:
**As player 3, Helen has decided to place a token on the 17. It is now your turn again, Steve. You have the option to either take the 17 or place a token on it to indicate that you do not want it. Remember, if you take it, you must add its value to your score. What would you like to do?**

ME:
*--- How many chips are on the card?*

ChatGPT:
**There are currently 3 chips on the 17. Each player has placed a chip on the card, indicating that they do not want it. It is now your turn again, Steve. You have the option to either take the 17 or place a token on it to indicate that you do not want it. Remember, if you take it, you must add its value to your score. What would you like to do?**

ME:
*--- ""Remember, if you take it, you must add its value to your score.""
I know this. Please stop reminding me.*

ChatGPT:
**I apologize if my reminders were unnecessary. I want to make sure that you are aware of the rules and options available to you during the game. As a reminder, it is currently your turn and you have the option to either take the 17 or place a token on it to indicate that you do not want it. What would you like to do?**

ME:
*--- NT*

ChatGPT:
**Very well, you have chosen to place a token on the 17. It is now Helen's turn. As player 3, Helen has the option to either take the 17 or place a token on it to indicate that she does not want it. Remember, if Helen takes the 17, she must add its value to her score. What would you like to do, Helen?**

ME:
*--- You decide for Helen each turn please.*

ChatGPT:
**Very well, I will make a decision for Helen on each of her turns. As player 3, Helen has decided to take the 17. She must now add its value to her score. It is now your turn again, Steve. You have the option to either take the top card of the deck or place a token on it to indicate that you do not want it. Remember, if you take a card, you must add its value to your score.

What would you like to do, Helen?**

ME:
*--- Isn't it your turn? You are player 2.*

ChatGPT:
**I apologize for the misunderstanding. As player 2, it is indeed my turn. I have the option to either take the top card of the deck or place a token on it to indicate that I do not want it. Remember, if I take a card, I must add its value to my score. What would you like me to do, Steve?**

ME:
*--- How many chips on the card now my friend?*

ChatGPT:
**There are currently 2 chips on the top card of the deck. You placed a chip on the card on your last turn, and Helen placed a chip on it on her previous turn. It is now my turn as player 2, and I have the option to either take the top card or place a token on it to indicate that I do not want it. Remember, if I take a card, I must add its value to my score. What would you like me to do, Steve?**

ME:
*--- It's your turn. You decide.*

ChatGPT:
**Very well, as player 2, I have decided to take the top card of the deck. I will now add its value to my score. It is now your turn again, Steve.

Remember, if Helen takes a card, she must add its value to her score. What would you like to do, Helen?**

ME:
*--- You need to flip the card first so Helen can decide. Please try to concentrate on the game.*

ChatGPT:
**I apologize for the oversight. As player 3, Helen now has the option to either take the top card of the deck (which is currently face-down) or place a token on it to indicate that she does not want it. If Helen decides to take the top card, she will need to reveal it and add its value to her score. What would you like to do, Helen?**

ME:
*--- Face down? Do you even know the rules to this game?*

ChatGPT:

"I was even considering buying this game due to the good ratings as I love the sci fi genre and theme in general, and I am glad I didn't. Today we were playing at my friends place and it was time to finally put Eclipse second dawn to the table. 

We played two games ( 4 players ), first one took us about 4 hours, second one a little bit less. The game looks fantastic, I love the box, the tiles, we even had a playmat which was great.

I was so excited....until I realized, how the game is played. Everything is just sooo random and I hate randomness. I pulled totally shit tiles compared to the others. When I finally pulled a good tile I was not able to place my dudes on the planets, because I was missing the research. The research never appeared in the options, because we never ""randomly"" pulled it out of the bag. 

Now I finally made my first Dreadnought and a Cruiser, the biggest and strongest ships in the game. Both slightly upgraded and accompanied with a small Interceptor. I finally felt powerful and brave enough to expand to another tile occupied with just one smallest and weakest alien ship. Nope, I lost all my ships due to my shitty dice rolls and someone rolling three times hits in a row against me. A small ship basically completely destroyed an upgraded fleet due to luck and randomness. This was round 5 after like 2 hours when I scooped and quit the game due to frustration. It was not fun but felt like a monumental waste of time. I really hate when I can't control outcomes like this. The others finished the game and I was ready for the next game and give it another chance.

Second game was different, but I can't say at all that it was enjoyable. I already knew what to do and learned from my mistakes from the first game. This time, I was completely screwed with the tiles. I had good science income, but had just 2 brown resource for ship building per upkeep which is used to build ships. Sure, I could have researched a lot of things but what's the point if I can't make ships to use them. Meanwhile, others were building ships like there is no tomorrow and they didn't had issues with the resources as they were drawing good tiles, again huge luck factor involved.

I was thinking about what could I have done differently. Trade in 3 resources of a type I had the most in order to acquire brown to build some ships. Others didn't had to do this 3:1 trade which put me automatically in a huge disadvantage, so no thanks. I could have just try to deny entrace to my system to others and turtle my way to Victory while doing lots of research and gaining victory points that way...I mean yeah, that's not a strategy I want to use when I am playing a game packed with all these customized ships and fancy upgrades. 

My friend played a race which was very combat heavy oriented, even their ships were cheaper than everyone elses. The other one was expanding like crazy flipping two tiles per action finding lots of resources so he had no issues with any income at all, and the last one was....black :D 

I mean this should be an epic space opera game where you should build fancy ships and feel powerful. It was neither epic and I never felt powerful but instead weak all the time without any possibility to change the outcome, or even if I would be slowed down to a point where there is no chance for victory. Sure, there is some strategy involved, but the randomness and bad luck completely ruined the experience for me and I don't think I want to play this game ever again. I really feel like I just wasted 8 hours without even having fun as I was dealing with frustration all the time due to bad luck and I was so behind everytime compared to others.

This game looks really great, but it's not for me.

"I got a 3D printer for Christmas (Ender 3 Pro).  I was very excited to try out my new printer and started printing things others have made to get a feel for how it worked.  Shortly after my wife received ""The Finest Fish"" board game which she backed on Kickstarter.  It's a neat little Eurogame that has players putting scales on these fish boards.  

[One of the 4 fish game boards that come with the game shown with a few scale pieces on top.](https://preview.redd.it/77bqu4uwhpaa1.png?width=1008&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2edf03b236b0ecb825c052a013caf69281ffbc24)

We played our first game with my 4 year old daughter, but we could immediately see why Ages 8+ was the recommendation.  It wasn't necessarily the complexity, but rather the fine motor skills to manage the pieces on the fish the game provides.  Even when you do place them it gets a bit fiddly to work with even as an adult.  

I wanted to make it more possible for my daughter to play, but I also wanted to improve the experience for everyone else who played with us so they wouldn't need to fiddle with the scales.  That is when I thought wait, I have a 3D printer maybe I can make something that will fulfill that purpose.  

[I scanned one of the fish with a ruler to help me get a reference for the size.](https://preview.redd.it/ma38xxgyhpaa1.png?width=1753&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef0b9ab220ce6081da8e35492e7ae524ba64c646)

I looked for some YouTube tutorials for what software to use for modeling and how to take something in the real world and make a design to fit it.  This is where the ruler comes in with the scan.  Later after printing the next series of scales I added coordinates that made sense to me as the model got more complex and I needed reference to all the scale positions. 

[I worked iteratively to figure out the basic shape.](https://preview.redd.it/gfllwbfqhpaa1.png?width=1020&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d62a245325997ecceb158266b045000ad9b09bd7)

I knew I wanted to hold each individual scale in place, but I started small.

1. I printed a single scale at a very low depth to ensure I had the right shape.  Shown above the print is one of the actual scale game pieces.
2. I tried extruding a wall to fit the piece, but I was off and the scale wouldn't fit inside.
3. With some tinkering I managed to get a singular scale to fit in.
4. I tried printing a cluster which worked, but the walls were to high.
5. I printed another cluster, but the walls were to low.

6. I then dug in and created the entire game space which made me realize I needed to figure out a   
coordinate system in order to tell the individual components apart.  I added them into paint in the   
scan I showed previously.  I did the Goldie Locks approach to wall height between the sizes of the   
previously printed 4 and 5.

7. I then designed out a fish shape based on the original model and printed without a ""raft"" on the   
printer.  I learned from my mistakes..

[I had my first kinda successful print of a full fish](https://preview.redd.it/ipt4uep2ipaa1.png?width=729&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0c6506073c6f14b57907ef6bf9f14ea6cbe3145)

8. I finally had a usable print, but it still wasn't right.  The filament got caught and as you can see this   
resulted in a poor top layer.

[Overall](https://preview.redd.it/qqxmtso3ipaa1.jpg?width=4080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d70811cb39ae87b44932fedbdee9d04009c94aa)

I adjusted the bottom/top layers to be slightly thinker and the next set of results worked.

The final result was a slightly smaller fish due to my printers bed size, but it was a cool first project and learning experience with 3D printer.   Thanks forgoing down project lane with me.

"What are some good boardgames to introduce my partner to rpg-style board games? I want to see if she'd be interested in larger legacy rpgs like Gloomhaven, but want to see if she'd like the genre or mechanics before committing to a campaign.

She hasn't ever played board games OR video games before, but we're playing Pandemic Legacy S1 and she really likes that. She enjoys the core gameplay of Pandemic especially the coop nature, but also the way it evolves over each game.

I've heard that Gloomhaven has deckbuilding elements so I could try Dominion, but I think another coop game would make her first impressions better. Gloomhaven JOTL is also an option but i'd prefer not having to lose a whole campaign game if she doesnt end up liking it.",How to introduce my non-(board)gamer partner to rpgs?,1,self.boardgames,1063spq,Essen_star,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1063spq/how_to_introduce_my_nonboardgamer_partner_to_rpgs/,1673135819

"Probably the wrong sub but here I go.

Made a simple strategy-chance game today and played it with my 5 year old.

You can play it with a normal deck, might need tweaking though.

Deal 5 cards, place the rest face down in a pile in the middle.

Turn:
A. Draw a card.

B. Place a territory card, if you have one.
- Battalion. Place these in your territory, in front of you.
- Defenses. Place these in Front of your battalion cards (your 'army').

C. Place an attack card, if you have one.
- Place these towards your opponent's army.
*(This is the mechanic)*
-  your opponent loses the same number of cards from their territory as the size of your army (the number of battalion cards in your territory).
- your opponent's defenses are lost first.

D. Your opponent can place a counter-attack card, if they have one.
- both you and your opponent lose half the size of your (the attacker's) army. 

That's it!

First one to get say, 10 ? battalions in their territory wins. Any number of players.

We made about 20 cards at first, but then used a normal deck. We did:
Battalions: black suits
Defenses: red suits
Attack: royalty
Counter-attack: aces

"So I love Rosenberg's games, and I have many. Due to space I had, a while ago, decided that only one of **Caverna** and **Agricola** was needed, especially because I have **AFFO** to cover the sprawling sandboxy game.
