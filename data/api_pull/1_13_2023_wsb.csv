"Hello Investors and Gamblers! We all know what Tesla is, but do we really know what it is worth? Are you bagholding and want to know if you shall cut losses or hold it to the core of the Earth? Or are you looking for a good entry price for a heavy Call or Put slapping?

Well you came to the righ post! Here i am evaluating TSLA Fair Value for you! Hope you enjoy the reading! And don't forget to share with the community your thought and prayers! Cheers!

 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Purpose**

The purpose of this thesis is to analyse the development of Tesla during the past three years, from 2019 to 2022. Not only are the financial statements taken into consideration. In addition, a comparison to its main competitors and the market situation is also made. All is made to determine the fair value of the stock price and determine the investment strategy. All is made to answer the following questions:

* What is its position compared to competitors?
* Is the company fairly valued by the market by its fundamentals?
* Is the company a Buy or a Sell?

**Delimitations and Assumptions**

This thesis is delimited to an analysis of TSLA between the years 2019 and 2022. The thesis is based on the assumption that TSLA is the one of the most trending automotive company in the world, and that the prestige it has will support its price action in the next months.

**Methodology**

In this thesis, data from its financial statements are taken from SEC filings, Yahoo Finance and other publicly available information on the company on-line. The Company valuation is made based on:

* Adjusted Graham Fair Value Formula
* Free Cash Flow Evaluation Model
* Discounted Cash Flow Model

**Hypothesis**

* US next interest rates hike of 25-50bps
* Inflation of 6.5% and cooling down to 6% for January 2023
* TSLA is high volume stock
* TSLA is overvalued
* There are many TSLA bagholders
* TSLA can‚Äôt outproduce its competitors in the near nor mid term

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# Methodology

The thesis used macroeconomics data from the 13th of January 2023 for its valuations, Income Statements, Balance Sheets and Cash Flow are considered and projected to the next three years. The final price tag is obtained by the average of three valuation methodology: Graham Formula, Discounted Cash Flow and Cash Flow Evaluation. It is then given a 20% margin of error in both direction.

# Evaluation Methods

In this paper, three methods are used to evaluate the company's final fair value. Each method gives us different current fair values for a single share of the company. The final price tag is determined by the average price between all the methods used.

&amp;#x200B;

# Growth Rate

**The Growth Rate of 24.40%** is determined by the average analysts consensus for the company‚Äôs next year growth rate.

&amp;#x200B;

# Free Cash Flow Evaluation Model

This simple model takes in mind the company last year‚Äôs available cash flow data, its WACC based discount rate of 12,84% and its Growth Rate of 24,40% to determine a fair value of **$78.88** per share.

&amp;#x200B;

# Adjusted Graham Fair Value Formula

This model is used in the Value Investing communities to price tag a company based on its intrinsic value. This formula is created by Benjamin Graham, a value investor and professor at Columbia University who is considered the father of Value Investing. This thesis uses the adjusted formula to better adjust it to the current market environment.

Data used for the calculation:

|Data|Value|
|:-|:-|
| EPS | 3.24 |
| Growth Rate | 24.40 |
| AAA Bond Yield | 4.40 |

 The Adjusted Graham Intrinsic Value Formula gives us a price tag of **$101.74** 

&amp;#x200B;

# Discounted Cash Flow Model

This thesis uses Free Cash Flow, gained by subtraction Capex from Cash floe From Operations. Free cash flow (FCF) is the money a company has left over after paying its operating expenses and capital expenditures. It is used to remove the impact of capital structure on a firm's value and to make companies more comparable

In simple words. It is the cash flow of a company based on the belief that the company owes no debt, therefore has no interest payments to make.

In this model, it is taken in mind the following data:

|Data|Value|
|:-|:-|
| WACC based discount rate | 12.84% |
| Growth rate | 24.40% |
| Average US GDP growth rate | 3.18% |
| Average Shares outstanding | 3,157,752,000 |

Which projected a FCF for the next five years as per follow:

Note: the projection is based on the assumption the company will keep growing by a perpetual rate of 24.40%, which is highly improbable due to unknown future events and variations in the market. This shall be taken only as an indicative forecast.

The calculation gives us a Fair Value of **$70.99** per share

&amp;#x200B;

## Final Fair Value

The Final price tag is determined as per following:

|Data|Value|
|:-|:-|
| Free Cash Flow Evaluation Model | $78,88 |
| Adjusted Graham Fair Value Formula | $101.74 |
| Discounted Free Cash Flow Model | $70.99 |
| **Final Price + 20% error margin** | **$104.83** |
| **Final Fair Price (Average)** | **$83.87** |
| **Final Price - 20% error margin** | **$62.90** |

# Products 

Tesla recently lowered their products price tag amid demand fall. Here are listed the current price tag as of 13th January 2023:

* **Tesla Model X** $109,990
* **Tesla Model 3** $43,990
* **Tesla Model Y** $52,990
* **Tesla Model S** $94,990 

Total worldwide unit sold in thousands:

* 2022: 1,313
* 2021: 935
* 2020: 367
* 2018: 244

We can observe a 40% increase of Unit sold in 2022.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# Insider Transactions

There are heavy and frequent sell activity from insiders of the company from all departments, biggest drop of shares come from the CEO itself.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# SWOT ANALYSIS

 Strengths

* **Most Valuable Automotive Company**: It is currently the the automotive company with the highest market capitalisation.
* **Tesla Increased its Electric Vehicle Delivery**: In 2022 it increased its deliveries of 40% from 935 milion  to 1.3 billion units.
* **Cross-sell and Diversification**: Tesla has comprehensive insurance program for its vehicles in association with Liberty Mutual insurance company.
* **Innovative Company**: Tesla has a very high rate of innovation, the market expects the company to develop competitive and profitable products.

 

### Weaknesses

* **Manufacturing Complications**: Tesla faces continuous launch, manufacturing and production ramp delays while launching their new vehicles and other products. For example, Tesla faced endless manufacturing challenges when they were about to launch Model X, which lead to constant delays for distribution. Similarly, the company went through extreme troubles while manufacturing Model X‚Äôs battery module assembly line at Gigafactory 1.  
* **Unable to meet demand might affect brand value**: Due to highly experimenting and complicated procedures, Tesla‚Äô might face an unbalanced supply and demand, unable to meet the production ramp. 
* **Lack of High Volume Productio**n: It has failed to produce high volumes of automobiles for any of its models. Even now, as the company plans to manufacture Model 3 vehicles at high volume, it faces issues in terms of production cost and management resources.
* **Shortage of Batterie**s: The shortage directly affectes the sales of electric vehicles and energy storage systems.
* **Elon Musk as Tesla‚Äôs Sole Representative**: Musk is deeply involved in other projects and side quests.
* **Financial Uncertainty**: Tesla has outstanding debt of $5.38 Billion. If the company is unable to generate enough cash flow to repay its debt, then there is a risk of delaying expansion, reducing investments, selling assets, etc.
* **Employee Safety Concerns**: Tesla was recently fined in 2019 for creating a tent production line without a permit or safety inspection. Also, the company did not train workers about the risks of working in the tent for long periods under the scorching California‚Äôs heat.
* **Leadership Wrangles**: Friction and conflict between management and the board of directors can undermine productivity and long-term success. Tesla‚Äôs management and board have been engaged in several power struggles.
* **Tesla Faces Lawsuit over Sexual Misconduct**: Many Tesla workers filed a lawsuit alleging sexual misconduct and harassment at the workplace. The women have complained that the company fosters a dark culture of sexual misconduct. They also alleged that they were cat-called and were frequently subjected to shameful remarks, groping, and misogynistic behaviour.  

 

### Opportunities

* **Sales expansion in untapped Market**: The most significant opportunity for the company right now is the Asian market, even tho there are increased risks.
* **Less Expensive Car**: Tesla‚Äôs Model 3 is a more affordable version of Model S with less range, power, and fewer features.
* **Bringing battery production technology in-house**: Tesla intends to make its own battery cells. 
* **Market Confidence in Tesla**: The stock market has shown confidence in Tesla after beating the projected car deliveries.

 

### Threats

* **Product Liability Claims**: The company has faced lawsuits and claims related to the failure of technology in their products. If these liability claims continued, then Tesla may be subjected to greater financial setbacks.
* **Extensive Competition**: Tesla, Inc. faces aggressive competition from both alternative fuel vehicles (Hybrid, Plug-in hybrid, fully electric car) and self-driving technology. Many automotive brands in the luxury segment like Mercedes, BMW, Audi, Lexus and in the economy segment like Toyota, Ford, General Motors , Volvo are getting ready for a fierce competition. Many brands are not only launching or planning to launch their environment-friendly-Self-driving technology but also, they are offering them at a comparably lower price. 
* **Product Defects**: Tesla‚Äôs cars and other energy products have exhibited major flaws in many cases. The defective products often have weaknesses in design, manufacturing, and other features which harm the company‚Äôs image permanently.
* **Long term confidence**: Tesla, due to its unstable manufacturing conditions, suffers from disbelief among the public about its long-term existence, which can result in a deficiency in further business development.
* **Customer Adaptation**: The company highly depends upon customers willingness to adopt electric vehicles.
* **Disruption of Supply Due to Shortage of Materials**: Tesla can face major suspensions in the supply of manufacturing materials due to the increased prices. The company uses aluminum, steel, lithium, nickel, copper, and cobalt, as well as lithium-ion cells from suppliers. All these materials have volatile prices, which can affect the company‚Äôs production line severely in the future.
* **High-Risk Factor Due to Usage of Lithium-ion**: Tesla uses lithium-ion cells in their battery packs. Lithium is a highly reactive and explosive element, which increases the risk factor of our products. Tesla has faced a a few cases where their cars have caught fire and vented smoke, which has defamed the company on a major level.
* **Elon Musk‚Äôs Behavior Affecting Tesla‚Äôs Reputation**: Tesla‚Äôs entire reputation is built upon the cult of Elon Musk. But recently, his waky behavior and impulsive reactions are affecting Tesla.
* **Competitors increasing productions of EV Vehicles**: Competitors are jumping in the EV segment eating huge portions of the market share.

Current short interest as of December 30th, 2023, is at 58%, or 38.55M shares, this does not account for the incredible amount of short interest that has accumulated over the last 5-days.

Both MM's and short sellers want to see this stock tank today. This biggest Gamma Squeeze is next week on Jan 20, 2023. This week is lined up nicely as well. If we close at $4.00, all of the $1, $2, $3, and $4 ITM contracts get exercised. We were all hoping to close at $5 or $6 to get those contracts in as well, but we will see.

Now, out of that 42M short interest volume increase, obviously they kept those shares for today to try and plummet the stock as much as they could, but do not forget the borrowing rate fee that they are paying, literally every day that goes by they are losing a shit load of money, and if they are holding any profits, it is now digging heavily into that.

Don't forget next week the markets are closed on Monday. The shorts that are in this stock are betting with conviction that this company is going to go bankrupt and hit zero, we are betting that it will either have an M&amp;A, or simply, not go bankrupt at all and remain in business. This is in addition to the FUD articles being printed this morning with the sources being ""Trust me bro"", it's actually kinda comical.

Those who are short this stock are in a very tough fucking situation because first off, there are no shares available, second, the borrow rate fees are fluctuating between 96% to 300% +, days-to-cover are ranging between 4.5 to 4.9 (which is even more insane). Float is 65M, Outstanding shares are only 117M.

This company has a lot of catalyst going for it and there is a lot of DD supporting these catalyst, equally, of course, this company could file for bankruptcy, but a lot of us do not believe or feel confident that they will be filing at all. It is really a 50/50 bet. 

Regardless of what was mentioned above, just based on the technicals alone, no matter which way you cut it, this stock is in a prime situation for some explosive action.

I wouldn't be surprised if we see a run-up in the last hour or in AH today.

Also, they are hunting your stop losses as they can see your stop losses when you apply them. Be aware of that. Short sellers always try to create a short and distort tactic and will invest heavily to create panic to better their positions.

Don't be discouraged folks and have fun gambling everyone.

"# ""Gaze Turns From Macro CPI to Micro Earnings... and an Inconvenient Truth Ahead""

***Summary of McElligott's important points below...***

&amp;#x200B;

**""Beautiful CPI print"" for the tactical 'disinflationary doves'**

* Increase in lagged 'shelter' pricing was easily offset by broader decreases in energy, food, autos et al
* Most recent trades went ""right way"" - all of the recent 'panic grab' into ""right-tail"" (rally) outcome trades from majority of clients w/o enough ""risk-on""

**USD Crushed**

**Rates -&gt; Curve explosively steepened** *to the delight of leveraged funds who desperately needed a break in the negative carry/roll trade*

**US Equities gapped higher** *before seeing rush to monetize upside option exposure which created substantial $Delta for sale on the unwind, and market consolidated intraday around the 4000 strk Gamma*

**Single Names saw duration-sensitive stocks** *- i.e., the majority of Most-shorted, lowest quality, highest leverage, highest vol/beta cause pain on explosive squeeze higher over the course of the day and YTD. Watch Meme stocks and squeeze stock stop-hunt exercises...*

&amp;#x200B;

**""Worst Shall be First, on de-grossing of shorts/adding back to nets:""**

https://preview.redd.it/pz50y12wzuba1.png?width=1262&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3acaa4c393da8817f5744e4971e05cc4461d6ea2

**""Most folks just don't have enough 'risk' on due to the impulse macro regime pivot to 'disinflation' - hence said 'grab', which is being echoed in Street PB data showing substantial Week over Week jumps in net exposure (chasing the rally)""**

Fits within the theme of recent weeks -&gt; now largely flipped out of the consensus ""macro trend trades"" from 2022's FCI tightening regime (Long USD vs Short Assets), and now seeing this pure reversal OUT of dollars and back INTO assets, with bonds/equities/credit/commods now being chased into FCI-Easing trades in early 2023 from historically low exposures.

**EQUITIES &amp; INDEX VOL NOTES**

* Much discussed talking-point on the persistent ""over-realization vs implied"" on CPI event days over the past \~year finally went ""wrong-way"" as Gamma didn't pay, with the market essentially pinned thanks to the aforementioned big monetization of Upside / Call structures - largely as a function of the magnitude of the phenomenal 7.7% rally in IWM/7.3% rally in QQQ/5.0% rally in SPY over the past \~week, which incentivized locking-in of gains, aided too by the gravity of the largest $Gamma 4000 strike (SPX), and helping to offset underlying buyers who finally are sensing a macro ""green light"" to add risk back

**Equities Index/ETF Vols were smashed**

https://preview.redd.it/jn2yg00xzuba1.png?width=1257&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=ff26ce6bafe28e93a610a9dd6699a90757cce228

* Overwriters snapped up the opportunity to lay into historically ""rich"" upside/Call skews and sold optionality - *YTD, seeing this increased confidence (and positive returns again) from options selling strats in general, after a rough 2022*
* Tail strategies continue to underwhelm despite this constant ""wall of worry"", bc we are seeing the macro 'worst case scenario' left-tail distribution of outcomes get cut/repriced lower and the ""good"" outcome of the ""transitory goldilocks""/""soft landing"" picking up delta
   * ""Immaculate disinflation"" in US looking outright ""transitory"" again, as Fed ""over-tightening accident"" risk passes with terminal rate projections off the boil and ""pause"" well in-sight
   * US economic growth holding firm, led by still-strong labor &amp; services
   * China ZCS being lifted, with reopening providing a boost for the global economy and pushing back ""global recession"" fears
   * Deep European recession viewed as avoided thanks to the energy crisis cooling
   * Ukraine/Russia relatively stable

***It has been a short-delta, short-skew trade for most of the past year, bc as global CBs were forced into an impulse tightening to crush demand-side inflation through tighter financial conditions, it's been a ""slow, grinding, controlled demolition"" of legacy risk/asset exposures.***

In turn, said ""grinding"" de-grossing of exposures, in the case of equities, meant a ""crashless"" selloff - very orderly, in fact, which by the second half of 2022 meant that Skew and Put Skew were at historically LOW levels as there was simply not enough exposure on to require ""crashy"" downside hedges.

Instead it meant that all the ""crash"" protection demand was for RIGHT TAIL upside trades, hence 100%ile/upper90%ile SPX Call Skew rankings over the back part of last year into the start of this year... because nobody had the underlying exposure -&gt; in case the macro data/narrative allowed for a shift in the ""FCI Tightening"" regime

Finally beginning to see signs of Skew/Put Skew firming as investors starting to require hedging again!

&amp;#x200B;

**CTA POSITIONING ESTIMATES &amp; EXPOSURES**

Aggregated Net Global Equities Exposure in the CTA model is now back to highs / ""Longest"" since Jan 6th 2022, where the massive ""Short USD"" trade expression into ""Rest of World"" Equities Longs being established on ""Past Peak Inflation = Past Peak Fed"" ironically sees the former decade-long high-flyer Nasdaq (Duration-sensitive of course) as the last remaining ""major"" full-tilt ""Long"" holdout from being all the way back in a ""+100% Long"" signal seen across 11 of the 13 total futures tracked.

"Hello!

There are tons of tools that track insider trades, but I ***think*** I'm the only one that tracks the returns of insiders that buy their own stock to know which insiders tend to buy their stock before the stock pops (or at least I'm the only one sharing it for free lol). I figured I'd share some findings here :).

&amp;#x200B;

**How It Works**

The startup I work at is building a social stock platform where you connect your brokerage and then can find other investors, see their holdings and returns, and follow them to get notified when they trade. To do this, we pay thousands of dollars a month for access to stock market data and spent the last year or so building an internal Stock Data Service. This makes it possible for us to calculate historic returns for insider trades and so I spent some nights and weekends building out my ""CEOWatcher"" program to track insider trades and see which insiders have the best returns.

Each day I grab the insiders that filed a Form 4 showing that they bought stock. I then go get all of their previous Form 4s, use our APIs and Stock Data Service to handle price adjustments and calculate returns, and then store that info in a DB. I built a leaderboard of the top insider trades (image below) and also check each week for the best insider trades which I shall share below.

&amp;#x200B;

**Terminology**

Returns - The weighted average return over a given time frame

* Overall Returns - The weighted average return for all of the insider‚Äôs trades from the day they made the trade until the day this post is made
   * Calculate ***the price when this post is made / price the insider paid*** to get the overall return for each trade and then take the weighted average of all of those returns
* 1-Year Returns - The weighted average return for all of the insider‚Äôs trades from the day they made the trade until one year later (note: a trade needs to be at least one year old to have this calculation)
   * Calculate ***the price one year after the purchase / price the insider paid*** to get the 1-year return for each trade and then take the weighted average of all of those returns
* 90-Day Returns - The weighted average return for all of the insider‚Äôs trades from the day they made the trade until 90 days later (note: a trade needs to be at least 90 days old to have this calculation)
   * Calculate ***the price 90 days after the purchase / price the insider paid*** to get the 90-day return for each trade and then take the weighted average of all of those returns

Win Rate - The percentage of trades that are profitable for the given time frame (overall, 1-year, 90-days).

&amp;#x200B;

## The CEO Trades

**Mark Hildebrandt - Director at HEI (**[**Form 4 Link**](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/46619/000004661923000022/xslF345X03/wf-form4_167347250092725.xml)**)**

This purchase marks Mark‚Äôs (nailed it) 16th purchase of HEI. It is also his largest purchase ever ($217,535) and comes after a big stock price drop (-40% in 6 months). He has purchased stock every year since 2011, but he skipped 2022 (probably because he knew the stock was not going to do well).

*Extra*\*\*\*:\*\*\* 8 other directors/executives at HEI also purchased stock simultaneously, and they all have similar returns and win rates as Mark.

**Returns and Win Rate**

***Overall***\*\*\*:\*\*\* 300% average returns with a 100% win rate (16/16 trades were profitable)

***1-year***: 40% returns one year after purchasing with a 93% win rate (14/15 trades)

***90-day:*** 23% returns with a 93% win rate (14/15 trades)

&amp;#x200B;

**Purchase Data**

***Total Amount Purchased:*** $217,535

***Purchase Price:*** $157.07

***Current Price:*** $163.65 (+4%)

&amp;#x200B;

**Rating**

***Rating:*** 9/10

***Why:*** The only minor knock is that the stock is already up 4% since his purchase, but everything else looks great. The win rate and returns are fantastic, we have a good amount of history (15 previous trades), the stock price is low (-40% in 6 months), and it‚Äôs his largest purchase ever.

&amp;#x200B;

**Leighton Thomson - CEO at AKAM (**[**Form 4 Link**](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1086222/000108622223000002/xslF345X03/wf-form4_167278319759747.xml)**)**

Last week, we found that Leighton had kicked off a 10b5-1 plan to start buying up stocks and he has continued purchasing this week. He has twice before gone on a buying spree with good results.

Back in 2017, he spent the last 6 months of that year buying $7M worth of stock and averaging 90-day returns of 13%, 1-year returns of 43%, and all-time returns of 67%, which has netted him almost $5M in profits overall on those trades.

In 2016, he also bought up stock every month except for January. He wasn‚Äôt as successful over the 90-day (5% returns) and 1-year periods (6% returns), but still has fantastic overall returns (56%) on the $15M worth of stock he bought that year.

**Returns and Win Rate**

***Overall:*** 106% average returns with a 97% win rate (32/33 trades were profitable)

***1-year***: 28% returns one year after purchasing with a 63% win rate (15/24 trades)

***90-day:*** 12% returns with a 63% win rate (15/24 trades)

&amp;#x200B;

**Purchase Data**

***Total Amount Purchased:*** $125,335

***Purchase Price:*** $86.05

***Current Price:*** $88.05 (+2%)

&amp;#x200B;

**Rating**

***Rating:*** 7/10

***Why:*** Overall, a pretty strong rating due to a large amount of history (33 trades), a nearly perfect overall win rate (32/33), and solid returns. The only downside here is that his 90-day and 1-year win rates aren‚Äôt amazing, but this still could be a solid long-term play.

## 

**Roxanne Austin - Director at CRWD (**[**Form 4 Link**](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1535527/000141588923000625/xslF345X03/form4-01062023_090123.xml)**)**

Roxanne doesn‚Äôt have a ton of history, but this was one of the largest insider purchases of the last week, her 2nd largest purchase ever (only \~8% lower than her largest purchase ever), and a well-known company.

**Returns and Win Rate**

***Overall:*** 66% average returns with an 83% win rate (5/6 trades were profitable)

***1-year***: 30% returns one year after purchasing with a 100% win rate (4/4 trades)

***90-day:*** 1% returns with a 50% win rate (2/4 trades)

&amp;#x200B;

**Purchase Data**

***Total Amount Purchased:*** $3,366,700

***Purchase Price:*** $96.19

***Current Price:*** $97.92 (+2%)

&amp;#x200B;

**Rating**

***Rating:*** 6/10

***Why:*** The two knocks on her are her limited history (only 6 trades) and her lackluster 90-day returns. However, you don‚Äôt often see big, well-known companies like this come across our scanner, so that makes it particularly compelling. Plus, in her limited history, she has pretty great long-term returns and with this stock being down \~65% over the last year or so, this may be a good long-term play with a lower risk profile than most of the stocks we find.

&amp;#x200B;

There are two more I found this week, but their market cap is too small for WSB so unfortunately I can't post them.

&amp;#x200B;

"https://www.home.saxo/content/articles/outrageous-predictions/a-country-agrees-to-ban-all-meat-production-by-2030-06122022

¬†The EU will continue to cut pollution. This will mean that traditional meat will be produced less or be banned, I don't think will happen. But at the same time, it must be remembered that it was not many years ago that we did not think electric cars would take over the world. And now tradisionaly cars will be banned in the years to come. ¬†So nothing is impossible. In any case meat shares as I call them such as Meatech 3D ADR will increase dramatically in price during a possible meat cut. I think 3D printed meat is the new salmon industry. Then, for example, a $1 share will cost $30 in a few years. This is the future I really belive it. Personly I buy hard for this stocks now a days. The future is clean, the future will create a lot of new companys not only meat. Because of EU focus on pollution. Think future, the past is past.

"The S&amp;P 500 is down 0.2% in midday trading, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 37 points, or 0.1%. The Nasdaq composite is also down 0.1%. 

Despite the mixed results, all the indexes are on track to notch gains for the week and the S&amp;P 500 is still up 3.5% for the year so far.

I'm keeping an eye on how companies are navigating high inflation and a slowing economy, as it's impacting their profits and ultimately affecting stock prices. 

Friday marked the first big day for companies in the S&amp;P 500 to show their results for Q4 of 2022. 

I'm paying attention to Wells Fargo, which fell 1.1% after reporting weaker revenue than expected, and Delta Air Lines, which sank 4.2% after giving a forecast that didn't meet expectations. 

On the other hand, I'm seeing positive results from health care companies like UnitedHealth Group, which rose 1.9% after topping analysts' expectations for profit and revenue.

I'm also concerned about the possibility of a decline in profits for S&amp;P 500 companies for Q4 of 2022, as it would be the first such decline since 2020. 

This, combined with a potential recession, could lead to sharper drops in profits for 2023.

"Hi guys! I decided to share my story with you because none of my friends irl trade or invest their money so they don't understand how it is possible to lose it so fast. (I didn't lose big numbers because I'm from Poland)

**RUN I**

So my first what I like to call a ""RUN"" started 2 years ago when I was in high school. I worked through the summer of 2020 and made a couple of grand. As a rational 16 y/o I decided that mere consumptionism is beneath me for I am more ambitious that the rest of the society, oh how wrong I was. I started with trading what I thought were stock (CFDs) with fixed 20x leverage. As you could predict after 2 months of trading I lost everything and got depressed, completely neglected school and made the worst decision of my life, got into crypto.

**RUN II**

So in 2021 I bought a gaming laptop with rtx3060 and heard you can make some money by mining crypto. At the time I thought crypto was I scam, but hey, who says no to free money right? So after mining it I thought that it is such a waste for it to just sit in my wallet and started trading with it (don't fucking do it). I got rugged in crypto more time than I can count. Every single project that I got into was a scam, tried some airdrop hunting but all I got from it was 2 USDT and 1 coin that I decided to hold and it went from $100 to $0.05. Lost everything again.

**RUN III**

So we fast forward to 2022, my 18th birthday so I get a lot of money from my family and friends. And as a young and ambitious man I decided that mere consumptionism is beneath me (again!) and put 50% of my life savings into a certain crypto ponzi called Time Wonderland. And of course as a young and ambitious man I decided that mere spot holding is beneath and used leverage (please don't do this). After 3 days there was a massive liquidation of founder of the said ponzi and I got liquidated. Lost half of the money I got for my birthday in 3 just 3 fucking days. After that I decided to quit crypto and went back to trading CFDs. Longed the shit out of DAX 2 days before Russia attacked Ukraine and lost the other half of the money.

**RUN IV (the last one so far)**

So I live in Poland and we border Russia and after the war in Ukraine started, our government started a REALLY good marketing campaign of the military forces. So after finishing high school and being a broke degenerate I decided to join the army. Fast forward next month I get my first military salary and go back to trading. After losing everything in crypto 2 times I decided that the lessons were learnt and it's time to make it all back. Summer 2022 Ethereum goes up from $1000 to $2000 due to the merge narrative (if somebody doesn't know what a narrative is: [https://youtu.be/V3mQ8Y9GiwE](https://youtu.be/V3mQ8Y9GiwE)). Shorted the shit out of it at the beginning of September with 20x leverage and make like $10k (more than the average yearly salary in my country). Than shorted another coin (don't even remember the name, just dumb fucking luck) and made another $10k, all in the span of one week. And after making what a the time for me was a life changing money I decided to yolo it all trading altcoins with high leverage, lost almost everything by the and of September 2022. Lost my last pennies in FTX crash trying to long their token, I know it's really fucking stupid, I also longed LUNA during the crash, I'm just really bad at trading.

**RUN V, when ??**

So right now I study Computer Science and accumulate money to make it all turbo back trading, I know I don't learn any lessons I'm a gambler. I really love trading and want to do this for the rest of my life but feel like I'm addicted to it. Sometimes when I was about to get liquidated I would stare at the charts an literally pray (even though I'm atheist) not to get to.

What do I do? Should I stop or keep grinding and just hope to get lucky?

"Crypto.com just laid off 20% of their workforce and let me tell you, it's like the apocalypse over there. Apparently, the company's ambitious growth plans couldn't handle the collapse of FTX, which is honestly pretty funny if you think about it. I mean, they spent $700 million on the naming rights to the old Staples Center, but couldn't handle a little crypto exchange collapse? Ouch.

But in all seriousness, the CEO, Kris Marszalek, said that it's all part of a ""continued focus on financial prudence."" Sure, Jan. But let's not forget that this isn't the first time Crypto.com has had to let people go. They also had a round of layoffs in 2022. And let's not forget those high-profile mistakes like accidentally transferring $400 million worth of assets to another exchange.

Honestly, I'm not surprised. Startups are hard, but Kris Marszalek's quote, ""there is no better way to live,"" sums it up pretty perfectly.

"Treasury securities are loans to the federal government. They are considered one of the safest investments as the U.S. government backs these securities.

As you can see below, Treasury securities are divided into 3 primary categories ‚Äì Bills, Notes, and Bonds. Treasury securities are classified according to the length of maturity.

* Treasury Bills mature in 4, 8, 13, 17, 26, or 52 weeks.
* Treasury Notes maturity date can range from 2, 3, 5, 7, or 10 years.
* Treasury Bonds mature in 20 or 30 years.

This article will cover one of the most closely watched indicators of broader investor confidence, The 10-Year Treasury Yield.

**SO, WHAT IS THE 10-YEAR TREASURY YIELD SPECIFICALLY?**

The 10-Year Treasury Yield is the yield the government pays investors that purchase the specific security. In short, a loan to the U.S. government. The yield is considered an indicator of investor confidence in the markets. It shows whether investors feel they can make a higher return by investing in stocks, ETFs, or other riskier securities. Or whether investors feel they can make a higher return on the yield offered on a 10-year note.

As I said earlier, the 10-Year Treasury Yield is one of the most closely watched indicators of investor confidence. The 10-Year yield is also used as a proxy for other important financial matters, such as mortgage rates

*‚ÄúHow is it used as a gauge of investor sentiment?‚Äù*

The U.S Treasury sells bonds via auction and yields are set through a bidding process. When investor confidence is high, prices for the 10-year drop and yields rise. This is because investors feel they can find higher-yielding investments elsewhere and don‚Äôt feel the need to play it safe with treasury securities.

Vice-versa, when investor confidence is low, bond prices rise and yields fall. This is because there is more demand for safer investment.

All else equal, when a bond‚Äôs price falls, its yield increases. When a bond‚Äôs price increases, its yield decreases. Bond price and bond yield are inversely related.

**WHAT AFFECTS TREASURY YIELDS?**

Many factors affect the 10-Year Treasury Yield, the most considerable being investor confidence. Investors set the yields of bonds via a bidding process.

Inflation also affects Treasury Yields. In short, inflation makes interest rates go up. This, in turn, makes bond values go down.

Interest rates also have a significant effect on Treasury Yields. Interest rates are the benchmark from which all other rates are derived, so they directly impact yields. Demand for Treasury securities increases when the Federal Reserve lowers its key interest rate.

**Key Takeaways**

* Treasury securities are loans to the U.S. government. Maturities can range from a few weeks to 30 years.
* Bond price and bond yield are inversely related
* When investor confidence is high, prices drop and yields rise.
* Treasury securities are backed by the U.S. government, so they are seen as one of the safest investments.

"I recently found out that the state of Louisiana passed a bill in June that requires websites with a certain percentage of sexually explicit material to verify the age of visitors to the site, effective in 2023. 

This has already started on the popular pornography site Pornhub, according to TechCrunch. I have to admit, I'm a bit concerned about this new development.

I understand that the bill is meant to prevent minors from accessing sexually explicit content, but I can't help but wonder about the privacy implications of this new law. 

I've read that Pornhub reassures users that it does not hold any user data, and that personal information would not be stored. 

But I can't help but worry about data leaks or the potential for people who watch porn related to LGBTQ topics, for example, to be noted or stored.

I also learned that a bill similar to Louisiana's, requiring age verification on a federal level, has been introduced in Congress by Senator Mike Lee of Utah.

This means that more states could soon follow Louisiana's example and implement similar laws. I'm not sure if my state is next, but if it is, I'll have to be prepared to verify my age every time I want to watch pornographic content online.

Overall, I can see why the state of Louisiana passed this bill, but I can't help but be concerned about the potential privacy implications. I'll be keeping an eye on this issue to see how it develops.",I recently found out that the state of Louisiana passed a bill,1,self.wallstreetbets,10awu1v,Beautiful-Leave6May,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/10awu1v/i_recently_found_out_that_the_state_of_louisiana/,1673622601

"Stocks are on a roll. The Dow and the S&amp;P jumped Thursday, after December‚Äôs consumer price index showed inflation slowed down, as expected. The Nasdaq registered its first five-day winning streak since July. But it‚Äôs time again for companies to report quarterly earnings, and for the superstitious among us, Friday the 13th isn‚Äôt the best day to kick off the season.JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Bank of America all reported earnings Friday morning, as investors look to Wall Street for evidence about the economy‚Äôs health and insight about where things are headed. BofA and JPMorgan both beat the Street as higher rates helped bolster interest income. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon on Friday said the U.S. economy ‚Äúremains strong‚Äù but warned of potential turbulence stemming from Russia‚Äôs war in Ukraine and still-high inflation.Tesla has cut the prices of some of its vehicles in the United States and Europe after wrapping up a fourth quarter that saw its deliveries fall below expectations. Tesla has long been the top dog in the electric vehicle space, but its competition is growing. Interest rates also surged last year, which made financing new cars more expensive for consumers. Tesla CEO Elon Musk is also widely considered to have damaged the company‚Äôs brand due to his chaotic, controversial and high profile takeover of Twitter.

Overall Market Outlook: 

**SPY** - Long legged doji candle close on the daily TF. We fully filled the gap above and we still have the one below to fill. IMO we see blood tomorrow! We are still in a rising wedge and squeezing setting up for a move on the hourly TF. Expected Move +/- $3.53

**QQQ** - Hanging man candle close on the daily TF. We are still in a rising wedge on the 4Hr and 1Hr TF. And we are squeezing setting up for a move on the 1Hr TF. Expected Move +/-$3.11

Watchlist:

**TSLA**: - Hanging man candle close on the daily TF. And we have a symmetrical triangle on the 1Hr TF. Take 128c or 130c Calls above 128 or 128.80 (safer entry.) Take 117p or 116p Puts below 118.70 BNH. Expected Move +/- $4.00

**NVDA**: Bullish candle close on the daily TF. The Three White Soldiers candle pattern I mentioned played out along with the ascending triangle we were in! We now have a double top but also a tweezer bottom on the daily TF. Aint that some mind games.. Take 170c Calls above 167.80 or 160p Puts below 161.58 BNH. Expected Move +/- $4.00

**DIS**: Came up to test resistance around $100 and pulled back from this level yesterday. I believe we could see a move lower over the coming weeks after rejecting this level.

**PTRA**: Trading around a major resistance level around $4.40, if we see a drop below this level I believe the stock moves lower over the coming weeks.

**IBB**: The stock rejected $135.50 support three times over the past couple weeks, I believe we get another rejection of this level.

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/carvana-cuts-workers-amid-slowing-sales-and-debt-squeeze-11673568956

Carvana Co. [US:CVNA] is further cutting staff and facing a deeper slowdown in sales as it tries to reduce costs and conserve cash to stay current on more than $7 billion of debt, employees and industry analysts said.

The online used-car seller is quietly terminating employees, cutting hours and letting open positions go unfilled, according to current and former employees and internal emails reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.

Several operations teams are working fewer than 30 hours a week or four-day workweeks, the emails said. Carvana laid off 4,000 employees last year, nearly a fifth of its staff, after growth slowed from a torrid pace during the pandemic.",Carvana Cuts Workers Amid Debt Squeeze.

BACKGROUND
I had been teaching for a bit over six years when I decided to change my occupation. Don't get me wrong, I loved teaching, but my real dream was to be financially independent and trade full-time. So, I shopped around the internet in search of trades to take. I spent time on youtube, and learned a lot about identifying set ups, option greeks, theta, momentum, etc. I found it interesting how I was following the same ‚Äústrategies‚Äù as others, but they were profitable and I was bleeding. In an attempt for relief I sought out a platform where I could receive trade alerts, and personalized guidance. I wanted profitable trades, and someone to answer my many questions.
IDENTIFYING A GROUP  
I didn't know where to start, so I created a paper trading account and joined all of the popular trading groups one by one. Most of the groups sent trades late, when they were no longer executable, or were being run by ‚Äúanalysts‚Äù who were in no way vetted or qualified. However I knew I found a winner 5 days into my week trial at Primetime Trading Group , I got clear timely entry and exit alerts on stocks, options, and spreads, as well as access a Superior web of analysts who took the time to explain things to me so I could understand what i needed to do to move my account forward.
FINDING SUCCESS
With the $25,000 I had saved over the years I switched from paper to a live account,  and began trading options, thanks to this group of traders. I  quickly started seeing success.  At first I was only able to mimic whatever John, the Lead Trader was doing on the live stream. With time, and after a couple private sessions I became more familiar with what to look for in trades, and how to control my emotions and always get out ahead of my peers. All in all, joining this group completely changed how I felt and the results of my trading for the better and I Hope you guys are able to get as much out of this group as I was.","Reddit lied, I printed off this trading group",1,self.wallstreetbets,10as1ap,Valuable-Champion422,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/10as1ap/reddit_lied_i_printed_off_this_trading_group/,1673608548

On Jan 12, the three major indexes all closed higher on the Dec CPI news, at one month high. At the close, the Dow was up 0.64%, the Nasdaq was up 0.64%, and the S&amp;P 500 was up 0.36%. The 10-year US Treasury yield dropped 2.71% to 3.455%, compared with a yield spread of -70 bps over the two-year note. VIX was down 10.72%. Brent crude closed up 1.11%. Spot gold closed up 1.11% at $1,896.79 an ounce. The dollar index was down 0.97%, closing at 102.25.

.

The quarterly U.S. consumer price index in December came in at -0.1 %, the first negative reading since May 2020, which economists attributed to lower energy costs. The seasonally adjusted annual rate of CPI came in at 6.5 %, falling for the sixth consecutive month and the smallest increase since October 2021. The core CPI rose at a non-seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.7 %, the smallest increase since December 2021. The US core CPI rose modestly in December, adding to evidence that price pressures are easing and giving the Federal Reserve room to slow the pace of interest rate hikes next month.

"My last serious DD I posted on a stock was about Lordstown Motors ($RIDE) and why they were headed to zero. While my timing might have been off their finances pretty much followed what I thought it would. Time to do the same for AMC.

Just a clarification‚Ä¶ When I say ‚ÄúAMC‚Äù I refer to the company. When referring to the specific tickers will use $AMC and $APE.

Also, a warning‚Ä¶ This is going to be long and detailed. Only read if you are interested in serious DD analyzing the fundamentals here. I try to minimize any speculation in my comments here and try to stock to factual points.

&amp;#x200B;

**$APE vs $AMC**

***What is $APE and $AMC***

To start with a brief discussion on the difference between $AMC and $APE shares is helpful.

In August 2022 AMC issued a ‚Äòstock dividend‚Äô of 1 unit of $APE for each share of $AMC owned, accordingly at that time for every share of $AMC there was a unit of $APE outstanding. The number of outstanding $AMC shares at the time was around 500,000,000 so there would also be about 500,000,000 million $APE units outstanding then.

The $APE units (you can call them shares instead of units) when created had contractual rights to be converted to $AMC shares, ***IF*** *at some point there are enough $AMC shares to allow conversion of all the $APE units*. In order for this to happen it would require a board resolution and shareholder vote to increase the number of $AMC shares. The conversion ratio (before factoring in any splits, reverse-splits, or future stock dividends) was 1 $APE unit = 1 $AMC share. Any splits or the like would require adjusting the conversion ratio accordingly.

The $APE units have participation rights in AMC equivalent to $AMC shares. This means if the company were to ever issue a dividend, each unit $APE gets the same dividend as each share $AMC does. The $APE units also have equivalent voting rights to $AMC.

If following; from a strict investment standpoint, $APE and $AMC are the exact same thing and you should buy the lower priced of the two. If you are looking at this from a squeeze potential you may have other considerations that determine why you may want to buy one or the other.

***Why did AMC create $APE if it is the same as $AMC?***

If $APE effectively is the same as $AMC a question arises as to WHY the company did this.

The purpose of creating the $APE units was to help with raising funds. In addition to the 500M $APE units issued in the stock dividend there were approximately another 500M $APE units created and retained by AMC that could be sold to raise needed cash.

An alterative option to raising funds would have been to increase the number of $AMC shares and sell those, however the company believed attempting a shareholder vote to increase the number of $AMC shares would fail and accordingly that was not a viable solution.

With $APE, the Board of Directors found a ‚Äúloophole‚Äù that they determined allowed them without a shareholder vote to create the $APE units and accomplish fundraising via that. The end result of all this is that assuming the $APE units are all sold there would be about 1 billion $APE units vs 500 million $AMC units outstanding. In any future shareholder vote, in such a scenario, the owners of the $APE units would easily outvote owners of the $AMC shares. This was by design as they wanted the $APE units to be an attractive way of investing in the company. Naturally, as evidenced by the price discrepancy between $AMC and $APE this failed spectacularly and the company raised far less funds for the $APE shares sold than it should have.

***$APE Endgame ‚Äì Conversion***

In the end we have this overly complex scheme to create $APE units in order to get around the roadblocks preventing them from raising additional capital. Perhaps AMC hoped to sell the $APE units based on a price of $15+ a share (*look at what $AMC was trading at in August 2022 when $APE was issued*) and raise $7.5 billion ($15 x 500M shares), unfortunately through 12/21/2022 they raised only about $162.4 million on sales of about 110 million $APE unit due to the share price decline. The end result is that the amount raised was clearly far less than what was hoped here.

On 12/22/2022 the company entered into an agreement with Antara to effectively buy 257 million $APE units for $210 million. This agreement limited further sales of $APE units to $40M worth (*assume Antara would have wanted this to prevent dilution and decline in value of $APE prior to conversion*). The agreement also required a shareholder vote within 90 days to increase the number of $AMC shares allowing for conversion. When that vote happens, Antara‚Äôs 257M shares are agreed to be voted in favor of that resolution. *It is important to understand that the company cannot raise additional funds via APE at this time and accordingly their only viable option is to increase the number of $AMC shares which also allows for conversion, hence it was in the company‚Äôs interest to ensure Antara will vote yes.*

The number of outstanding shares that can vote are summarized as follows:

||$AMC|$APE|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Est. shares outstanding 12/21/2022|516,820,595|642,750,982|
|Shares sold to Antara|0|257,137,472|
|Est. shares outstanding when vote happens|516,820,595|899,888,454|

*\[The SEC filings on 12/22/2022 specify the number of $APE shares. The SEC filings on 11/8/2022 specify the number of $AMC shares. There is no known way the actual numbers could be significantly different than the final totals above as limits on number of shares issued for $AMC or rights of the company to sell $APE limit any difference here\]*

When the vote happens (must happen within 90 days of 12/22/2022), based on the current price discrepancy between $AMC and $APE it is clearly in the $APE unit holders interest to vote for conversion and with the number of votes they can muster as compared to $AMC it seems inevitable that this resolution will pass. Before factoring the impact of any splits or the like in, post-conversion there will be about 1.4 Billion $AMC shares outstanding (899,888,454 + 516,820,595).

I think it is a reasonable assumption that post-conversion we will see shareholders like Antara and others who formerly held $APE sell their shares of $AMC driving down the share price accordingly.

&amp;#x200B;

**$AMC Squeeze?**

Well of course there is a possibility of a squeeze in $AMC in the two months or so before that vote happens and conversion happens. However, every day we get closer to that vote the risk of shorting should decline.

Also, if a squeeze does happen it may result in the price discrepancy between $AMC and $APE increasing which could drive 2 behaviors that would limit the extent of a squeeze.

1. Shareholders of $AMC would be tempted to sell $AMC and buy $APE. For example, if $AMC, reaches a share price of $14 vs $APE being at $1.40 for each $AMC you sell, you can buy 10X the amount of $APE shares and post-conversion you have 10X the amount of shares.2.
2. It creates an increasingly profitable arbitrage opportunity where for those willing and having sufficient collateral, you can short an equal number of shares of $AMC and go long $APE. At conversion such a position will be cancelled out. At $14 a share $AMC and $1.40 a unit $APE such an opportunity would result in $12.6 in profit per matched share.

Given the above I think the possibility of a squeeze becomes more remote each day we get closer to the deadline for that conversion vote.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Financial State of AMC and Why Continued Dilution Should be Expected**

Per Box Office Mojo, Quarter 4 of 2022 Domestic box office gross is $1.775 Billion vs $2.068 Billion for Quarter 4 of 2021, roughly a 14% decline. Of course, if you compare Q3‚Äô 2022 to Q3‚Äô 2021 or other earlier quarters against each other there are substantial increases in revenue, but for Q4 there is not. For 2023, various projections have box office gross increasing about 12%.

While analyzing what is the minimum revenue AMC needs to be profitable is challenging, I did come up with an aggressive minimum of $750 million in Admission revenue per quarter (so about $3 billion in admission revenue per year). This is assuming various costs remain relatively low.

The following shows the Admission Revenue vs Income Before Taxes (in millions):

||Q3' 2022|Q2' 2022|Q1' 2022|Q4' 2021|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Admissions Revenue|545.3|651.0|443.8|666.6|
|Income Pre-tax|\-225.1|\-121.0|\-337.3|\-130.7|

If we add-back depreciation and instead deduct CAPEX it is roughly a $40-60 million improvement in pre-tax income, so still all losses.

Based on the Q4‚Äô 2022 decline in box office receipts as compared to 2021, I think reasonable to assume results will be closer to Q3‚Äô 2022 and we may see a pre-tax loss of somewhere around $200 million.

If Q4‚Äô 2022 revenue is $575 million, then the total 2022 admission revenue will be about $2.2 billion. Assuming for 2023 the revenue grows 12% that brings us to about $2.5 billion in revenue, still short of the $3 billion I believe is required to be minimally profitable.

A brief look at the 9/30/2022 financials shows that there is a stockholder‚Äôs deficit of about $2.6 billion. Without having to get into the details of what the assets and liabilities here are, based on continuing losses foreseeable for 2023 there is no clear path via operating results to pay down that debt. Perhaps in 2024 or 2025 the situation may change but currently their current assets continue to decline and without remedial action their liquidity is declining.

In terms of 2023 they have $471 million in long-term debt coming due so offset that with $370 million raised via sales of $APE and add the $200 million loss for Q4‚Äô 2022 to that and we have a year-end decline in liquidity of about $100 million. In terms cash‚Ä¶ They had $685 million in cash at 9/30/2022 and should be obvious that this is headed the wrong way.

Their most substantial debt (about $3.4 billion) is due in 2026. This means that unless the company can turn things around between 2023 and 2024 it is almost certain that by 2025 they would be out of luck as their ability to refinance the debt then would be materially impaired. Practically speaking the company can decide to watch its finances continue to erode this year and hope 2024 is a great year that turns things around or they can just bite the bullet now and raise whatever cash they possibly can.

A look back at 2019 before the pandemic shows that they were losing money even then. Basically, the assumption that they can rely on a return to theaters to power past their debt issues is not supported by past results. The obvious conclusion is that raising funds NOW before people are more keenly aware of their disastrous financials is necessary. Waiting to 2024, when who knows whether we will see a recession or even worse stock market, does not seem viable here.

In light of the above, I think the actions the Board took with issuing $APE and now moving forward with the process to allow for conversion is all clearly necessary as part of their overall plan to continue raising funds.

&amp;#x200B;

**So, What Happens?**

Obviously, the key question is what happens now? 

Before I share my thoughts, here is some market cap history for $AMC‚Ä¶ In Sep 2018 it was worth about $2.2 billion, in Aug 2019 it was worth about $1.2 billion. In Feb 2020 in the midst of dilution it was worth $778 million. At the current share price for $AMC of $4.94 a share, assuming post-conversion there are 1.4 billion shares that is a market cap of $6.92 billion, but using the current share price of $APE of $1.58 that is a market cap of $2.21 billion. Obviously, there is a price mismatch here, but consider BBBY and how it fell apart the moment big money walked away from it. It fell apart very quick. With the upcoming conversion here and the fallout from that we will possibly see an even more significant event than what happened with BBBY.

So, my thoughts as to what happens are as follows:

1. End of Feb 2023 they announce year end 2022 earnings. The results as I expect show continued weakness (perhaps even a going concern). Projections for 2023 don‚Äôt offer much hope of seeing a profit either. This dampens ‚Äúinvestor‚Äù confidence in the continued outlook for the company or at least will cause people to think twice before buying additional shares. I would think this, combined with the upcoming vote may drop $AMC to under $1 a share, perhaps $0.75 a share. 
2. End of Mar 2023 the vote to increase $AMC shares passes and all the $APE convert, resulting in 1.4 billion $AMC shares outstanding. This is followed rapidly by hundreds of millions of shares of $AMC sold by former $APE holders dropping the price as few are willing to buy (might already drop before as a result of substantially increased shorting of $AMC offset by long $APE positions if the price mismatch continues). If I had to guess, I would not be surprised if $AMC declines to about $0.50 a share as a result.
3. A reverse split is also affected reducing the outstanding shares 1:10 so to about 140 million and adjusting the price 10X to $5.00 a share (market cap about $700 million).
4. Company attempts to sell as many $AMC shares as they can, based on whatever resolutions would have passed in the end of March meeting in order to raise as much funds as possible. My guess is this will drop the share price further to say $2.50 a share (pre-reverse-split $0.25 a share) before 2023 is over.

&amp;#x200B;

**So How Do I Make Money Here?**

Congrats on making it this far‚Ä¶ If you don‚Äôt make money at least you are better educated.

Just a warning, the following make timing and value judgements and while I am very certain of the inevitable decline of AMC as described to some extent above, I am a terrible trader who no matter how smart I think I am, manages to bungle timing.

1. If you have the collateral and are comfortable sitting through a possible squeeze (more likely a mini-squeeze) then shorting $AMC and going long a matching amount of $APE should be profitable. Of course, carries the risk of a squeeze and seeing a large loss, pre-conversion, so not for everyone.
2. Look to 3/17/2023 Puts that pay off if the price is $1.00, with potential for further profit if the price declines to $0.75.
3. Look to 4/21/2023 Puts that pay off if the price is $0.75 with potential for further profit if the price declines to $0.50.
4. Look to 1/19/2024 Puts that pay off if the price is $0.50 with potential for further profit if the price declines to $0.25.
5. I would be very cautious with Jan 2025 puts and likely stay away‚Ä¶ What happens if the company manages to sell 1.5 billion shares for $0.50 each raising $750 million and in 2024 improvement in the industry results in some profit. Suddenly a market cap of $1.5B+ might be justified, which would be a share price of at least $0.50. Very difficult to find interesting options for then. If anything, if holding Jan 2025 puts would look to sell them well before Jan 2025.

"Seems like BBBY rises roughly every 5 months. Check out the chart below.

First rise was in Jan 2021, second in Jun 2021, third in Nov 2021, fourth in April 2022.

The last rise was in August 2022, and now is Jan 2023 which is roughly 5 months after the last rise in August 2022.

The rise has just started and is still in the early phase. Together, lets take BBBY to the moon!!

"TLDR: Basically the money for spring is due tomorrow, had health issues, all money drained, can't get need based financial aid because of my parents, can't get a loan without a cosigner, need a cosigner because my credit is 660, parents can't cosign. I will be kicked out tomorrow if I can't pay. Also a summary of my college experience.

&amp;#x200B;

Essentially tomorrow my tuition is due for my fourth semester of college. I live on my own and pay my own bills. I went and got a health issue checked out over the summer, and the U.S. healthcare system didn't like that very much. I never even found out the issue‚Äîjust got given the bill. I can no longer afford to pursue any kind of medical care, and I'm completely broke. Because I had to basically take a month off school to deal with my financials I lost most of my scholarships from having to drop below full time enrollment. Now I have to come up with another $7,500 by 4:30 p.m. tomorrow or be unenrolled.

I can't get a loan because my parents can't cosign for me on account of already cosigning for too many things for my other three siblings. My parents are also hindering me in the sense that I don't qualify for any kind of need-based financial aid because my expected family contribution exceeds any reasonable expense for my parents. My credit score is also down to 650-670 because I had used my credit card to buy groceries thinking that I would be able to get back on my feet sometime in the future.

I'm coming here because I've talked to everyone else I could. My appeals for the scholarships I lost won't get through until after the due date, and the bursar's office won't defer my payment.

This community has always brought me joy. I'll read just the most insane stories of someone betting their house and trying to figure out how to tell their wife, and the first comment is always something like ""dude just bet the kids and keep gambling."" It's just a really cracked out energy that makes me not feel sad about sad things. I think there's a definite argument for that behavior not being healthy, but I also think at a certain point you just have to find the silly aspects of things that really aren't getting any better.

I'm also writing this just because I want to rant to some people, because this year really just was not fun. I think I literally started adulthood with the best possible hand apart from just starting as a millionaire. I was Valedictorian of my high school, and my college literally was paying me to go there. I had a job that was insanely flexible with their hours, and my major of choice‚ÄîNuclear Engineering‚Äîwas at a school 30 minutes away. I decided I was working enough that I could move out, and I did move out last January into a one bedroom apartment for $840/month. It felt nice to feel independent, and it still does. Even though I'm broke and kinda really screwed, I'm still mildly proud that I was able to live on my own and survive for a year‚Äîknowing how hard its been for everyone under thirty living on their own.

I'm down to answer any questions. It is kind of late, and I'm running out of energy to talk. I plan to wake up early, call a bunch of banks and administrators. I don't really plan on giving up. I recently learned of a nuclear engineering peer that only takes one class a semester. If need be I might resort to that.

Biogen also applied for approval in Europe and will be covered under Medicare. Quote from CMS - ""Because Eisai‚Äôs product, lecanemab, was granted accelerated approval by the FDA, it falls under CMS‚Äôs existing national coverage determination.""

Biogen also recently got a new CEO Christopher Viebacher who was the CEO of Sanofi in who helped turn it around. What more they also have a drug in pipeline for depression as well.

 Their stock price is still lower than the PT for most analysts who issued ratings after the approval. With Spy doing reasonably well, biotech stonks like biib, lly seem poised to break out.

"This is a small micro cap company that has been heavily shorted and called a zero but the great thing it doesn‚Äôt matter if it is a zero because the subsidies that utilities are getting for using solar, wind etc‚Ä¶ and all that needs backup so even if short sellers are right they have no way to deal with a now $8.5 billion dollar pipeline of deals that deals in gravity based technology and some more short term solutions like lithium but its already signed deals with PG&amp;E for 10.5 years for providing backup storage, another deal with Berkshire Hathaway energy subsidiary that invests in clean technology and so its extremely undervalued because these aren‚Äôt my words I took them from a Seeking Alpha author whose name escapes me currently:

‚ÄúValuation

The company is currently valued at an enterprise value of $157M. The market cap is $405M, so there is no debt and about $250M cash. Since the company has no positive cash flow, a fundamental valuation of the share is difficult.

The current share price is $3, but the company has $1.8 cash per share. This sounds great, but remember that this cash will be used soon. In the trailing 12 months, the loss was $68M. With this or an even higher cash burn rate, the remaining money will not last very long. In such a case, one should rather look at the market capitalization and less at the enterprise value.

From a price/sales perspective, the company is estimated to generate $83M in revenue this year. In the three quarters of 2022, the company is at $47M, so the last quarter would have to add quite a bit to reach that revenue target. More important is how things will go anyway. The stock is currently tracked by five analysts who forecast explosive growth: over $1 billion in revenue and positive earnings per share in 2024.‚Äù

Basically, its a win-win if their magic energy gravity machine technology works, or the secret sauce is actually the software not the original idea or even if the majority of the work they do is just short term battery backup solutions they will be getting subsidies and growing. 

The date to look out for is when they break ground in Nevada this coming year. Also, on the institutional front their was a lot more buying then selling.

Current Position: 200 shares but plan to increase it as the market does its thing going up and down until we really crash b/c I don‚Äôt trust a roomful of men surrounded by a probably overwhelmed staff to make any sound decision. It already went from $3 to $4 and my cost average is $3.52 with the squeeze that‚Äôs going on so this could be a terrible idea but to me its low risk/high reward. I‚Äôll make some more DD if anyone is interested. Not trying to pump and dump, its a legit company that has signed major deals. Just google Energy Vault, its a Swiss company and I forget if links are allowed but I would link the latest earnings presentation.",$NRGV,1,self.wallstreetbets,10ahr89,AdAny631,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/10ahr89/nrgv/,1673574743

"You stock brokers use game theory in a similar way to we poker players, but game theory wasn‚Äôt named after stock brokers! You guys work together in gangs, pushing your weight around to make profit, but we poker players work alone. 1 vs 1000. We don‚Äôt get massages off each other after work, we make each other cry and go home broke. You guys play a nice game, with great profit margins, but we poker players have always been the masters of strategic theory.

I‚Äôm a poker theorist who advanced way beyond my piers. Everyone in the poker world thinks I‚Äôm crazy, but only because my logic is way too advanced for them!! I am the Michelangelo of game theory, but teaching my theories is painful and slow, so, I‚Äôm going to put them into practice myself instead‚Ä¶

To that end, I‚Äôve designed a new game to replace trade. I‚Äôve built a prototype too, and the MVP will be out soon.

My game is far better than trade. It‚Äôs more efficient, and it realises far more currency. Eg. Google search is valuable to each of us, right? But it‚Äôs free. That means that ‚Äútrade‚Äù as a game doesn‚Äôt account for this value. This value is lost, because you can‚Äôt get paid in trade currency if you give away something for free!

My currency will add quadrillions to GDP. This won‚Äôt cause inflation, it will actually give all the trade markets a cute little boom in value, but that won‚Äôt last long. In around 10 years trade currency will be dwarfed by my new currency, then one day the trade markets will crash and the revolution will be complete. On that day, you‚Äôll all be grateful to sell me your worthless trade currency. In fact, the sooner you send me your money the better it will be for you!

Don‚Äôt hate the player! I‚Äôm being really nice here!! I didn‚Äôt cause the downfall of trade. All games go through the same death throws, caused by the loss of potential profit as the players get closer to equilibrium. All I‚Äôm doing is bringing all that profit back. I also reversed a couple rules so that when the players close in on equilibrium we‚Äôll see paradise on earth instead of the end times like we‚Äôre seeing now.",All Your Money will Soon be Mine!!,1,self.wallstreetbets,10agm3r,YadiJavadi,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/10agm3r/all_your_money_will_soon_be_mine/,1673571721

" I was thinking about the hype around Game Stop back in 2021 and was thinking that there probably won't be another like that for a while. But the main cause of the crash was Robinhood getting rid of the buy button, so what if there was a way that both investors and Robinhood would profit in a way that everyone goes home happy. Well, Robinhood has their own stock ""HOOD"" and has stayed the same since its quick fall in its launch. So the advantage? Robinhood won't want to turn off the buy button as their company's shares are on the line and their vault that they used to pay sellers will remain full and will continue to grow.

"Ok, so to clarify right off the bat, I obviously understand how quickly and easily you can lose money trading options but I dont understand how people lose 50k or over 100k like I see in so many posts. 

Do people buy options like loto tickets? Just go buy loto tickets then, or go hit up the roulette table at a casino. How much are are people even spending each week on options if they only have 50k in their trading accounts? 

Option trading is very high risk, high reward so you have to be extremely deliberate on when and why you buy them. Typically, I only buy options when I feel close to 95% sure there will be a large increase or decrease in the price of a stock in the short term. I also sell them rather quickly once I make profits since options are so volatile and you can usually buy them back for less than you sold them the second the price stops going up for 5 minutes. 

However, it feels like people on here buy options everyday, on any stock that is trendy and pretty much cross their fingers and pray to the investing gods that they land on red or black. Also, if you lose 5-10k on options, wouldn't you realize you have no idea what you doing and stop option trading?

A few great tips that have made me successful in trading options:

1. Don't spend too much on options since your going to make a lot of money if your right anyway. Best to have a rule on how much you are comfortable losing should the option play not work out. I try to keep it under 1000$ at the most, but usually I will only spend a few hundred when buying options. I think a good rule of thumb is spending no more than 1% of your overall portfolio value on a single option play.
2. Stocks, even when they are trending up in value day over day, will always have moments when people take profits, where the stock takes a break and goes sideways or down for a few hours (or even days) before continuing the hike up. This is the best time to buy options since they fluctuate so much in value based on whether the stock is trending up or down. The second that stock price stops climbing, options often halve or quarter in value. Thats when you swoop in, buy them, and then when it continues the hike up the next day you'll make profit.
3. SELL YOUR DAMN OPTIONS WHEN THEY ARE PROFITABLE!!!!! This is the by far, most important lesson in option trading. If you buy an option that expires in 1-2 months, you have a deadline and the option will lose value every single day you hold it. Best to sell the second it's in the green unless you have a very specific timing you are waiting on (like news that you're expecting).   
4. This one is probably the most important piece of advice that isn't specific to options but super important none the less when trading. **Don't trade stocks or options when your unhappy with your life.** You will trade them with emotion, not logic and you'll want immediate results leading to higher risk-taking. Have a plan, know why you're buying a stock or option, and stick to that plan unless something changes. I can't count the number of times early on that I lost money being impatient, selling stock in a company I did extensive DD on just to chase the trendy stock of the week only to have the stock I originally invested in double in value 2 weeks later.",How do people lose 100k trading options?,1,self.wallstreetbets,10aegy2,Ajax746,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/10aegy2/how_do_people_lose_100k_trading_options/,1673566321

Came in pretty spot on for my CPI projection‚Ä¶. But today we saw an extremely flat market. The biggest thing that once again is suspicious is that we had a huge $2 run up followed be a $5 drop on the candle BEFORE CPI data even hit the markets. This happened last time also but last time it was just a run up. Last time they claimed there was no leaks but I would like to see their excuse this time‚Ä¶.

So where does this leave us? (I will do a far more detailed analysis tomorrow)

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7mjur92aqoba1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=fd03f73c191f09c54a58431c241a91aaaa0d562e

I have been watching this cup and handle on the daily play out no since we were below 390. 

Lets talk about the bull and bear case for tomorrow and going forward. 

Bull case: On one hand we are now in that 390 to 405.3 channel and with the current trend we are pushing for 405.3. We have an official daily 8/20ema crossover and tomorrow the daily 8ema will crossover the daily 50ema. This will put support (daily 8ema) at also major support of 390.1. We had a very good CPI print and first negative MoM CPI print since June 2020. Despite a flat open and for a while a red trend day we held support and managed to close a small green day. The VIX has now completely unwound. Without any real big news or data until FOMC there is not in my opinion any negative catalysts to expect until FOMC. This is where the media COULD really drive things. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k3p8jbuhqoba1.png?width=295&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d860bbf9f730f818ba506a8bfe65be54c867c0ac

Current fed funds rate is 4.25 to 4.5%. This means according to this pole the next FOMC meeting on feb 1st and a 34.6% chance of a 0bps and a 65.4% chance of 25bps‚Ä¶ This is about a 20% increase of 0bps since just yesterday. 

There is a very good chance markets are going to run on this pivot/ slowing of hikes narrative here till next FOMC. 

Key resistance levels im watching‚Ä¶ 398.3 (daily 200ema) which we struggled at all day, 401.2 (previous bear market resistance line) and then 405.3 which is the channel resistance for the current level we are in. 

Key supports remain 392.2 and 390.1. As long as bulls defend 390.1 it is bullish and any pullback should be seen as a buying opportunity in my opinion. 

I still personally work under the impression that we are trading within the 375 to 408 consolidation channel. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dncaongiqoba1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=1b786400694047523f78ea1df69c49d30ac4883b

Taking a look at a futures honestly I feel fare more bullish on futures than I do on spy. Today Futures held and reconfirmed 3990 as support and it also closed back over its daily 200ema for the first time since December 13th (the day before Decembers CPI). 

The thick red line is the previous bear market resistance (this is just a data point its not something that I would make a trade off of). The actual current bear market resistance line is closer to 4100 currently. 

On futures the daily 8ema is crossed over the daily 50ema and 20ema. The daily 20ema is about to cross over the daily 50ema. There is quite a bit of bullish technical formed on futures especially. 

Key support- 3990 -&gt; 3965 -&gt; 3940

Key resistance- 4020 -&gt; 4055 -&gt; 4080

&amp;#x200B;

Taking a look at Tesla I actually find myself to be far more bullish on Tesla than even SPY right now. 

Despite some long wicks and tough resistance at 123 tesla just closed its third higher close in a row (granted not by much). 

This is also the 4th close over the daily 8ema. This has only happened one other time since the major selloff happened back in September. 

I see four patterns to watch on Tesla here.. The first one is the blue bear channel. We have been in this channel since the middle of August. That resistance tomorrow is at 132.2 (+6.9%). The next pattern is the black bull channel that started back on Jan 5th but the support was established today and on January 6th. Support of this line is 121 and resistance tomorrow is 138.4 (don‚Äôt expect it to make it here). We also have the black/ red rising wedge formed. Resistance is three pointed using the 3rd, 9th and 11th. Resistance for this comes in at 128.3 and support at 121. The Last pattern which we broke today was the black/ grey consolidation channel. This channel was from 102.8 to 123. We did poke through it yesterday and I really believed we would have without the market wide dump/ consolidation seen a bigger push into the 130s today. 

With our 4th closure over the daily 8ema, back to back closings over 123 resistance and our third higher high I would be surprised not to see tesla push to at least 128 if not that 132 resistance of the blue bear channel. We also have to keep an eye on the daily 20ema which should be around 129-130 tomorrow. IF bulls can close over the daily 20ema tomorrow going into next week I would be very bullish on Tesla. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v4bdl88mqoba1.png?width=610&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=af2e9f6f0a88ab498786e314c5c218916eb866c7

Now I am not a hug fan of the VIX or using it to determine trades but its worth chatting about. It just put in a -10.67% day today. The biggest drop it has had since May 4th. Notably this is similar drop to Decembers CPI. 

This is the lowest the VIX has closed and touched since April 5th. If we break under 18.45 tomorrow that would be the lowest level the VIX has been since January 13th. Yes EXACTLY one year ago tomorrow. 

There was a study done that every time the VIX touches 19.7 if you bought a longer DTE put you would end up extremely profitable and there is another study that if you bought longer DTE calls when we touched 30 you would also be extremely profitable. IF we believe the bear market is not over and IF we believe the markets are going to start to panic about the next FOMC, CPI, unemployment and the possible recession ahead this is about as great of a play as any to long on calls. 

I highlighted it back on the SPY daily chart at the beginning of this that the last time the VIX touched these levels was December 2nd which led to a local top and the start of a downturn before the December CPI. That CPI then started an even bigger down turn from 410.49 top to the local bottom at 374.77 before we started our run up. There is absolutely a chance and it would be 100% within trend IF we are still in a bear market that today is the local top on spy and that tomorrow we are going to see a bigger sell off and we will be back under 390.1 by next week. 

However, lets think about where we are and where the markets are going. For me I remain under the conviction that we are in the 375 to 408 channel like I said. I also am under the conviction that the bottom IS in. And IF its not in it will be an extremely fast bounce off the bottom just like the low at 348.11. 

If we think about a neutral to bull market what does the VIX tell us and what does the VIX do? The VIX tells us essentially how many people are hedged to the down side (aka how much fear of a drop there is). IS there MORE or LESS fear than the last time the VIX hit 19.7 and below? In my opinion I would say there is way less fear and way less unknowns. 

So in neutral to bull market the VIX unwinding is NOT a sign to go short on the market its actually a sign to go long. A spike in the VIX would be a sign to go long though. So the question remains what type of market are we in? While by definition until we break through 417.74 we ARE still in a bear market‚Ä¶ but that doesn‚Äôt mean this bear market cycle is going to be like 2022s. 

If we look throughout 2022 every down cycle had clear catalysts to continue that trend downwards. We need a bearish catalyst in my opinion in order to see another leg down. I do not until we either get an unexpectedly high FOMC rate, the next CPI misses, we enter an actual recession or some sort of black swan event that we are going to see a huge leg down. 

Things that would change my mind on that is SPY losing 390.1 and the VIX getting back over 23. I still favor as long as 390.1 support is holding that we will revisit 405 to 410 minimally before we see the 370s again. 

**Daily log-**

I played a 5:1 strength strangle on Home Depot over night. Took a calculated risk and also took took a high probability play. However, despite the 66% chance that a strangle pays out the 33% chance played out today. Worst case scenario for any strangle or straddle is a completely flat open/ day and that is exactly what we got today. I wouldn‚Äôt change anything honestly. 

&amp;#x200B;

Overall not a bad day despite the loser straddle and was able to recover some of the losses with both Tesla and some SPX scalps. 

Tomorrow is the last day before yet another 3day weekend. 

For me IF we close over 399 tomorrow (this would be a close over the daily 200ema, the weekly 50ema and a key weekly resistance line) I am very bullish and would look for 408.8 next week. However, IF we have another red day tomorrow and continue to fall I would look for support around 390.1 to be retested next week first. If we lose 390.1 support then I am looking for 383 and possibly 375.6.",CPI review and is the market headed down or up next? 1-12-23 SPY/ ES Futures and Tesla Daily Market Analysis,1,self.wallstreetbets,10ac7nx,DaddyDersch,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/10ac7nx/cpi_review_and_is_the_market_headed_down_or_up/,1673561018

"I am long CVNA. While the company has credit problems due to their loans outstanding with Apollo (the ruthless credit investor), I believe that the company has been caught in a once in a lifetime market downdraft in used cars, which have been severely impacted by rising interest rates and supply chain issues. That said, I believe that if CVNA is able to make it through these challenges, the opportunity on the back end of this is meaningful. CVNA competes against many mom and pop used car dealers, many of which will go out of business due to this market. Thus, CVNA has a meaningful market share opportunity on the back end of this situation, which will lead to higher sales volumes. The company has also done a significant amount of work to streamline operations, which combined with higher sales volumes should drive the company towards their long-term profitability goals. I also believe that Ernie (CEO) and his team are top-tier operators in a sector not known for good management teams. Overall, while CVNA has a low-single-digit market share now, the opportunity to drive meaningfully greater market share in the years to come make me excited about the opportunity. Also, let us not forget that AMZN faced similar issues in the dot-com crash (problems with debt, falling share price, wall street investors turning against the company), yet has grown to become one of the greatest businesses we've ever seen. I'm not saying CVNA will become the AMZN of used cars, but the parallels are interesting, at least.",Carvana (CVNA),1,self.wallstreetbets,10aahd0,Chemical-Item-9318,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/10aahd0/carvana_cvna/,1673557058

"Been doing research to figure out why Party City is going to be the next big thing. Let's first dive into our previous meme stocks/squeezes to figure out what was the reason behind them:

Gamestop: Low market cap, retail, and the fact that no one really buys games anymore

Bed Bath and Beyond: Low market cap, retail, and the fact that no one really goes into stores to buy bedding

&amp;#x200B;

So where does Party City fit into this? Well, Party City does party supplies, and no one is really going into stores anymore to buy party supplies since we have online giants like Amazon. In addition, it has very low market cap and has the potential to squeeze to the moon. What do you guys think?

"It seems like selling 1-2 year out puts on major firms, or even just an index, would be a reasonably reliable way to play the market. My thinking is that the short AND long term trend would be for the stock price to go above your starting price (i.e. short term, for any given day, it is unlikely that you are selling puts at teh top simply because of regression to mean. And long term, because the mean of the market is generally increasing, on a long enough timeline.)

Am I missing something here, or is it basically printing money to sell such puts, and programmatically buy to close at some profit price (e.g. 30% profit, which seems conservative and likely just on the randomness of the near and decay). If a firm or the market at large has some major even that causes too high of a  cost to roll, then assignment would shrink the cash available for this strategy, but you still get the company at a price you were ok with at some point (assuming you are only selling the puts at prices you would have bought at.)

I see this as an inversion of ""buying the dips"" where you are effectively being paid on each dip by promising to buy at random prices (with the understanding that, eventually, any random price will be a ""low"" price for a healthy firm. 

The only real tradeoffs I see are to macro events where in severe downturn of the market or the firm, you are in for the ride. 
a) If market, you are probably fine in the long term just taking assignment and waiting for the security to recover. this is risky if the firm was heavily inflated and will not be reassessed at anywhere near your assignment price once the market recovers. Still, as long as you only sell at conservative values of the underlying (a non trivial problem), this should be unlikely.
b) If the firm is tanking due to structural problems (its model no longer working, legal trouble, isolated political/social challenges), your best option is to cash out at a loss. Depending on the degree of this loss, it could wipe out any benefit of this strategy. This seems like the only true ""loss"" mode.

Am I missing risk?
Anyone do this? Is there a name for this strategy?

"Some breaking news today, SpaceX announced Starship will launch soon officially, after year in development (Check Elon Musk twitter for Space). This is huge fucking news and I wish me as a space nerd could explain the gravity of the situation to the fullest, but just like the pre 1995 computer nerds, its difficult. Heres my best explanation.

The only thing that has stopped Space to become a trillion dollar + economy is the insane launch prices, which has slowly been going down due to reusable rockets.

Launching shit up in space went from 10k a KG ONLY 10 YEARS AGO, to 900$ now, and will BE ONLY 10$ if starship goes as planned (I dare you to bet against Elon musk)

This will enable us to launch infrastructure, sattelties, do in space manufacturing, mining, energy production (the list fucking goes on) the market for space is predicted to be bigger than the EV market (trillions, all because it now economicallyMakes sense to launch shit up in space cause of reduction in launch costs, and will soon be dirt cheap, which will cause an economic boom beyond belief). A space race is happening right now with 80% of all sattelties EVER LAUNCHED IN THE HISTORY OF THE FUCKING WORLD has been launched in the last couple years due to the recent cost reductions, imagine what will happen when starship launches.

Sattelties services from imagery, defence, communications, the market is fucking huge and is predicted to explode to 100 000 sattelties by 2030 (currently less than 5000) . Keep in mind sattelties last 4 years roughly in space before new ones need to be launched again (ca Ching, cash cow for launchers)

Companies like Varda space plan to manufacture organs and semiconductors in space with them launching there first manufacturing test plant in space next year (Google it, its real) the market in space is huge, companies are still trying to figure out how they will monetize this huge untapped market in the coming years as launch costs have finally dropped

Space stocks soared on this news today, whole sector is up a lot, especially $RKLB (SpaceX main competitor).

A huge bubble is going to form, like the dot com bubble. this market is huge, huge contracts of space infrastructure like space stations and satellites will be given.

Take this as a grain of salt, but in the space community here are the top ones

Recommended tickers $RKLB $PL and Rewire Space Stock

Stay the fuck away from $SPCE $VORB, any galactic Richard Branson stock, those aren't space stocks those won't benefit, they are billionaire joy ride companies.

$RKLB is my favourite.","Space, the finally frontier. Trillion dollar + economy opening up soon.",1,self.wallstreetbets,10a8z1n,CDNWSYOLOER,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/10a8z1n/space_the_finally_frontier_trillion_dollar/,1673553483
