"I have around $200,000 that I plan to invest this year while the market is down. I will be mainly using ETF‚Äôs and I am comfortable investing it for at least 10 years. For simplicity, my target allocation is 70% SPY and 30% IJR. My plan is to utilize a combination of direct purchases with short puts to DCA over the next several months till I am fully invested. My logic around using both is that the puts will help me enter at more attractive prices while also lessening the risk of missing a rising market from direct purchases (additional premium income is secondary consideration).  I am still trying to figure out what the ‚Äúbest‚Äù approach is to accomplish this goal. Does anyone have any experience or advice using short puts to DCA into the market? A few questions I have:  
\-	If my goal is to invest an equal amount over the next 4 months, for example, should I use the same ratio of short puts to direct purchases every period? (ie short 1 put for every 100 shares I purchase each month)  
\-	Should I short puts at different strikes for same period or keep it same % strike?  
\-	Should I use longer maturity puts with various strike prices?",Using short put options to DCA into market,1,self.wallstreetbets,106zfnh,Rich-Unit-1892,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/106zfnh/using_short_put_options_to_dca_into_market/,1673224342

"The 10-Year Treasury Yield is the most important indicator of Investor Confidence.  Why is it forgotten then?  What's the 10-Year Treasury Yield? And Why is it Important? 

Treasury Bonds are considered one of the safest, most secure investments. Because the U.S government backs it.  Treasury securities are loans to the government that range from weeks to as many as 30 years.   We will be talking about the 10-Year because it's the most prevalent

Wait wait wait  Quick Explanation  Think of Bonds like this  ""Bonds are forms of tradable debt""  The Government is the borrower, we as Bondholders are lenders

How can this help me?  Let's give you example: \*Prices for the 10-Year drop and Yields rise\*  What does this mean?  Investor confidence is high  Investors feel they can find higher-returning investments elsewhere and do not feel the need to play it safe

\*Bond Prices rise and Yields Fall\*  What does this mean?

"# January 6 Recap

https://preview.redd.it/giwalfoc6waa1.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4d172643f5fbe6e50e4001b6de8977652805531

SPY recently ended a streak of four consecutive weeks of losses. This was accompanied by a strong upward trend and increased trading volume, both of which are considered positive indicators. The index closed near the highest point of the session, suggesting further potential for upward movement in the future.

[Market Wrap](https://preview.redd.it/9xeq9sbe6waa1.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce2ddbf41489cfa7ee2e470361574e18cf90caa3)

US stocks closed near session highs on Friday, as traders expect wage growth to slow, assisting the Federal Reserve in its efforts to combat inflation. Treasuries rose while the dollar fell. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indices both gained for the week, with the S&amp;P 500 up 1.5% and the Nasdaq 100 up 0.9%. These gains marked the end of a four-week losing streak for both indices.

The December jobs report, released on Friday, did not provide a clear indication of the state of the American labor market. Hiring exceeded expectations for the month and unemployment fell to its lowest level in decades, but there were weaker gains in hourly wages. This has led to uncertainty about the future direction of Federal Reserve policy. In light of this data, investors now expect the policy rate to peak at less than 5% this cycle, down from 5.06% just before the release of the jobs report. Traders are divided on the size of the expected rate hike in February, with 33 basis points of tightening priced in. However, a quarter-point increase appears to be more likely than a half-point increase.

# üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I SPY TA - Monday January 9, 2023

SPY recently broke out of its rectangle pattern with increased trading volume, which is a hopeful development for bulls. Last week, the level of 387 was identified as a key point for a potential breakout, and it is now important for this level to hold.

If the breakout proves to be valid, it is possible that the index may test the levels of 395 and the 200-day moving average, which is currently at 398.68.

&amp;#x200B;

* Downside levels:
   * 386.46 (20 MA)
   * 384.96
   * 377.69
   * 368.42
   * 362.16
* Upside levels:
   * 390.08
   * 395.19
   * 398.68 (200 MA)

Bullish RSI divergence on the daily chart remains a viable indicator at this time. It is important that bulls maintain a position above the 20-day moving average, which is currently around the level of 387. This level will likely be tested in the coming week, and increased buying volume at or near this level could be a good sign that it will hold.

It is important to keep an eye on the 387 breakout level, as it is expected to be tested in the near term. If the breakout is successful, the first target to watch for is 393, with the second target being the 200-day moving average at approximately 396.

On the other hand, if the breakout level is not maintained, the index may retreat to the level of 382.

# Scalping Chart - Best on 2 or 3 min. Timeframe

*Try trimming 70-80% of your positions at the closest target and slowly scaling out as you approach the rest. You can also throw in a trailing stop loss once your positions have been reduced to protect against any potential losses. By following these guidelines, you can manage risk while still allowing room for some sweet, sweet gains.*

The current support level is 387.69 and resistance is at 389.29. Upside targets are at 390.76 - 392.03 and 394.47 - 395.09, while downside targets are at 385.65 - 385.03, 383.11, and 381.50.

What just happened in the house was the 20 forcing capitulation for certain demands by the speaker. One primary demand was that any single member at any time can call for a speaker revote. Aka fuck you and do what I want. The second major demand was to include some of them on the rules committee.

You may or may not know that these 20 individuals seem to be very highly regarded and have dogged support by many regarded individuals.

One of the first items coming up is the budget. I know many of you have an attention span shorter than my smol penis, but the last time this issue came up we came closer to an impasse than ever in our modern history. Why? Becaise of this same caucus, who openly said they're willing to go into default to get their way.

And now they have their party hostage and winning momentum, by stomping their foots while plugging their ears until everyone else gives up.

"Yes, you heard it correctly, if you are a beginner and you want to learn stock trading, Paper trading is the best rather than trying somewhere else.

If you are not desperate to trade by yourself, just start trading on paper whatever you learn or whatever you get from someone. You will get knowledge every day once you will start doing paper trading. I strictly recommend this because I have seen hundreds of people losing their entire money just because of limited knowledge and skill in the stock market.

It takes months to learn everything so don‚Äôt jump and trade with your hard-earned money. Just focus on learning if you have just entered the stock market rather than doing trades in your account.

I follow discipline while trading in the stock market because it‚Äôs most importantly required. The stock market is bigger and riskier for newcomers than they actually think. They are unaware of the potential loss probability behind intraday trading. They don‚Äôt have proper knowledge of intraday trading. They either follow tips providers or brokers who provide them recommendations which are giving them losses most of the time.

When the market is stable, they may earn a few bucks which gives them confidence but profit is not consistent for experienced players also so is loss amount will be always higher than the profit amount for newcomers, and in this way, they end up losing their initial capital.

Learning is a key to earning. I learned many lessons in stock trading I am mentioning a few below:

* Risk: Trading is 100% risky so if anyone tells you about Guaranteed or Assured profits, never believe in them. Trading involves high risk and it can be controlled but can‚Äôt be avoided. Risk will always remain there.
* Stoploss: Stoploss is like a shield for your capital. If you don‚Äôt wear a shield on the battlefield, you are taking a risk of your life and you may lose your life. The same thing applies in trading because if you don‚Äôt apply Stoploss to your trade, you may lose your entire money. So never hold a losing position without stop-loss.
* Profit/Loss are not Certain: Profit and loss are part of trading and nothing is certain so you have to be prepared for both. Every day is not the same and nothing is permanent so you have to be habituated to little losses too.
* Follow the Market trend: I have seen people either buying or selling one side without knowing the trend which gives losses every day. You have to follow the market trends. If the market is falling or in a bearish trend and you keep on buying, you will get failure most of the time. The same thing is on the short side. You have to trade with trends otherwise you won‚Äôt be able to gather profit.
* Over trading: I used to do too much trading in my initial trading days which gave me losses only. I learned that trading should be done sensibly not frequently. So do fewer trades which generates good profit rather than doing too many trades.
* No emotions or sentiments: Never expect from the market anything because the market doesn‚Äôt have any emotions or sentiments. Though you are in deep trouble and you want money for someone‚Äôs operation, the market will not understand your problem so never be sentimental while trading and control your emotions. Do trading like a robot who doesn‚Äôt have any emotions.
* Spare Capital: Use your spare or extra capital only for trading. Never use your primary capital which you are going to use after a few days in some emergency or other expenses. I have seen many people who use their emergency capital or that capital from which they have to pay certain fees for children or something.
* Risk Reward: Always calculate risk before entering into any trade because if you are targeting to make 10 Rs profit, your stop loss should be also 3‚Äì5 rs as per your risk appetite. Never hold any losing position without Stoploss.

" Up, down, sideways?! 

Good afternoon fellow traders!!! A pretty noneventful week last week IMO overall market wise as we were in a range most of it till an exciting Friday to bring us home!!!

I‚Äôm going to share my analysis of the SPY for the coming week to see which way we may go.

To start us off let‚Äôs remember Thursday the 12th we have CPI reports, this will likely bring some type of reaction either way from the SPY, so keep that in the back of our minds.

Starting with the micro let's analyze the price action of the last week. Below is a 6M day chart. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5sx7akppevaa1.png?width=883&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=351c682035d461c629e16c21bac253dfb1f338ca

 

The action Friday really shakes things up here. An above avg range day on above avg volume, with a strong daily candle close. 

Technically speaking this 380 level has been a line in the sand for the last 9 months. Let‚Äôs look at the chart below and see its importance.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h5n74l3uevaa1.png?width=883&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=443671ec76095e99b92bc96eb234fb9777989d05

 This 380 level, as well as 410, have been my two key levels in play for the last 9 months. As you can see 380 support was first set back in May of 2022, offering a sharp reversal back to 410 before retesting the support area of 380 once again. 

Each subsequent time we‚Äôve come down to this support area we‚Äôve had the same outcome. A reversal to the upside. The main difference between the prior times we‚Äôve spent down in this demand zone is how long until a reversal? 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/16zek28zevaa1.png?width=886&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e95aad0c4694ae3f8c262ac5c519e93ac366bc9

 The next key level we are coming into is 390. This is going to be in my opinion the place to watch whether we will go higher or lower in the coming weeks. At the very least this week I expect to test the 390 level pretty early on in the week. Either Monday or Tuesday. Depending on the price action at 390 this will give us more information on the next move. If we see some topping signs here and a failure to hold 390 then I am expecting a move such as this. 

 

https://preview.redd.it/jiv3n5k4fvaa1.png?width=883&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0808f981db0fa6abf172a970c03697079942e46e

 

However, if we can break and hold 390. Then I‚Äôll be expecting a move similar to the last few times we reclaimed 390 as support back in July as well November. If we can get a move like this then I‚Äôd expect at a minimum to test the descending trend line I‚Äôve had drawn for quite some time, at around 400. At max, a retest of the 410 area and hopefully our first higher high.

Lastly, let us look at some higher time frame weekly charts to see exactly what in my opinion may or may not be a good time for all of this to turn itself around.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/it4ojh57fvaa1.png?width=883&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1499670999ebcd376a81ba406de78eefb929900c

 

So as we can see in this weekly chart. I‚Äôve tried to portray via colors the significance of the swing highs and lows that have been set the last year. In red we have bearish trends, lower highs, and lower lows. Green ovals are our attempts of reversing this trend with either a higher high or higher low. The sole gray oval is neutral as it is yet not validated as a higher high or lower high until we see what the next attempt at it is. 

As of now, we are in the first position since last year to possibly rotate this trend and create a reversal. If we can break and hold 410 to the upside and then set a higher low to 380 after it pulls in then we will for the first time since 2021 be making higher lows and higher highs once more. What happens after that we do not know!

To wrap this up, In my opinion, I think we have some upside in the SPY earlier on in the week good for at least 2% to the 395 area. What we do after that will be key to whether or not we head higher to 400+ or see 370‚Äôs. So I will be watching mainly if we can flip and hold the 390 support once more and that will dictate my bias. 

Lastly, remember CPI numbers report Thursday which are bound to create some type of reaction in the markets. Again, in my opinion, if we come in under estimates I believe markets should rip off of that report, showing that even at Christmas time inflation can still start to fix itself and give participants hope the next Fed meeting will be good news. However, the odds of that happening may be pretty low so watch for the flip scenario to happen.

Good luck and happy trading!!!",We are going up this week! $SPY,1,self.wallstreetbets,106ruxu,SystemaTrading,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/106ruxu/we_are_going_up_this_week_spy/,1673206190
"Since the world is full of idiots, lets take away some logic to fit this DD. I promise, its for a good cause.

I look at robinhood, and in the past quarter have been exploring taking a few thousand into HOOD over the next two quarters. Robinhood is the Apple of investing. And here is why. 

**Robinhood: An idiots adventure**

When a company takes consistent steps towards gaining market share, it gets an eye from many. Robinhood is a primary ticker I think to watch this year and the next as even during this economic situation coming up, robinhood is showing solid ability to leverage their full potential. I see constant features opening doors for more accounts to open or expand their current methods. It allows for the platform to use is expertise in marketing to make you lose your money. And it's on your phone. More people from more walks of life are trading, and putting money into the platform. Reaching for Quantity while also aiming for quality. Which I will delve into below.

The aesthetic is important in life. Apple took this to a level that would have happened eventually, but of course they were first. And look at them now. The UI, ease of access, and marketing made them, and it's making HOOD. Remember, who made it easy to get and run a computer in a household? And who made it easy to open and trade for the average guy? 


**Debt, Cashflow, and other stupid numbers:** Alright fellas, we have reached the point where we start to dismantle some logic to fit this DD. It still works so try and follow. I keep hearing about debt load, cashflow, tricks, and other super intelligent things BUUUUUT A company such as this, when they take on more debt I see as a WIN and here is why; They have proven to take steps that work. I do not know how much those initiatives cost, but damn are they attracting people. So when they get more debt, I have a high expectation they will utilize that money in a great way for future investors. If someone is willing to give them money, with their track record of expansion I hope they TAKE IT.

** HOOD $8.25** 

I know nothing. I am terrible at math. But something is pulling me towards a multi year strat that has high gains possible. Where can they go but up? A backslid has happened but with consistent marketing wins and features grabbing more users this seems a fine price to get in on a secondary play. 

Where do I see it going? North of $20 but won't close the year above $30. Beyond that, it will take firm roots as core institution simply because people want them around, like what they do and how it looks. In the next ten years we must all expect something reasonable in gains but I bring you here for the 2 year look.


Q: What about (insert bank here , coinbase ) as a comparison? 
A: Shut up nerd robinhod is in a different catagory at this point with how they operate its just something I feel. Go touch some grass. Loser.

Hey guys  ready for fun next week?

We've got important data from the United States, China, and Europe, including CPI and trade figures, GDP figures, and unemployment and industrial production figures coming this week.

The market is kind of in limbo right now, trying to figure out whether to worry about more Fed rate hikes or hope for an economic boost from China's reopening. The latest Fed minutes made it clear that the central bank is still committed to targeting inflation, but they also warned that market rallies could get in the way.

We'll see if the upcoming CPI release is lower than expected,. It's not clear how the market will react to softer inflation numbers, especially with the Fed being cautious about market rallies.

Although the official data hasn't shown much of an impact from recent Fed rate hikes yet, GDP probably grew at an annualized rate above 2% in Q4. But survey data is starting to show the negative effects of tighter monetary policy, especially in financial services. S&amp;P Global's PMI survey data showed business activity falling sharply in December, with financial services seeing the steepest contraction. Consumer-facing sectors and manufacturing also struggled due to rising costs of living and slowing global trade. On the bright side, tech and healthcare remained in expansion territory, but it looks like GDP growth might disappoint in the New Year.

Let‚Äôs get to the calendar.

 

# MONDAY, JAN. 9

**12:30 pm: Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic speaks**

Bostic's speech might give us some clues about what's going on with the economy and where the Fed is headed in terms of its policies. Sounds interesting, huh?

**3:00 pm: Consumer Credit Change (NOV) Forecast: $24B Previous: $27.08B**

This data release from the Federal Reserve just shows how much credit people have taken out in the past month. It's just a measure of how much people are borrowing, and it might give us some clues about consumer spending and borrowing habits.

 

# TUESDAY, JAN. 10

Jerome Powell is giving a speech on 10th? It's like, who cares, right? I mean, Powell's speeches are always such a wild card. It's like the weather - you never know what you're going to get. One minute the markets are soaring, and the next minute, BOOM, everything crashes. But hey, at least it's always entertaining.

**16:00 Fed Chair Powell Speaks (medium-high )**

**17:00 Wholesale Inventories MoM (NOV) Forecast:** 1% Previous: 0.5% (medium )

This shows us how much stuff wholesalers have in stock, and it can tell us about supply and demand in the wholesale sector. They're expecting the number to go up by 1% from last month, which was when it went up by 0.5%.

**EIA Short-Term Energy Outlook**

This report tells us what to expect in the energy market over the next few months. I know it doesn't sound very exciting, but it can give us an idea of what energy prices might do, which can affect how much we pay for things like gas and home heating. It's not the most thrilling topic, but it's worth paying attention.

 

# WEDNESDAY, JAN. 11

It's going to be a busy day for oil and bond traders, with a couple of key data releases on the calendar.

**17:30 Crude Oil Inventories**

This report shows the change in the number of barrels of crude oil held in storage in the U.S., and it can give us an idea of the supply and demand dynamics in the oil market.

17:30 Cushing Crude Oil Inventories

More crude oil inventory data? You bet! As I said, busy day for oil traders. 

**20:00 10-Year Note Auction**

Time for a little bond action!

 

# THURSDAY, JAN. 12

The busiest day of the week!

**7:00 AM - ECB Economic Bulletin: The European Central Bank** will be dropping some serious knowledge on the state of the economy. Hopefully, they won't bore us to death.

3:30 PM - Core CPI (YoY) (Dec): This release measures the change in the price of a basket of goods and services over the past year. In other words, it tells us whether stuff is getting more or less expensive. **Forecast** **5.7% Previous 6.0%**

 3:30 PM - Core CPI (MoM) (Dec): This one is similar to the YoY release, but it only looks at the change in prices over the past month. **Forecast** **0.3% Previous** **0.2%** 

3:30 PM - Core CPI Index (Dec): The Core CPI Index measures the average price of the basket of goods and services included in the Core CPI. It's kind of like the ""average temperature"" of inflation if you will.

3:30 PM - CPI (MoM) (Dec): The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of the average change in prices over time for a basket of goods and services. This particular release looks at the change in prices over the past month. **Forecast** **0.1% Previous 0.1%**

 3:30 PM - CPI (YoY) (Dec): This release is the same as the MoM version, but it looks at the change in prices over the past year. **Forecast** 6.5% **Previous** 7.1% 

3:30 PM - Initial Jobless Claims: A measure of how many people applied for unemployment benefits in the past week.

**Forecast** 220K **Previous** 204K

 8:00 PM - 30-Year Bond Auction: The government will be selling some long-term debt today. Let's hope they can find some takers, or else they might have to default on their loans. 

 9:00 PM - Federal Budget Balance (Dec): The government's financial report card for the month. 

 FRIDAY, JAN. 13

**14:30 Fed Harker Speech**

**17:00 Michigan Consumer Sentiment Prel (JAN) Forecast: 60 Previous: 59.7%**

Following are details of the price cuts:

CHINA
Tesla slashed prices for all versions of its Model 3 and Model Y cars in China by between 6% to 13.5%, according to Reuters calculations based on the prices shown on its website. The starting price for Model 3, for instance, was cut to 229,900 yuan ($33,427) from 265,900 yuan.

Tesla cut the prices of Model 3 and Model Y cars by about 10% each in Japan, the first time it had done so since 2021.

"That is all. We waste so much mental and physical energy trying to ‚Äúget rich‚Äù. You think the rich are happier, only happier than those who can‚Äôt afford basic needs. Otherwise no. I‚Äôve met and mingled with so many wealthy people and they are all druggies or alcoholics and say things like ‚Äúthat trip you think is gonna be so great is never as great as you thought‚Äù.  

So my advice is, get yourself financially stable as long as it takes but don‚Äôt make money the focus of your day everyday.  And don‚Äôt worry if you have to rent a room with someone and figure out ways to eat cheap. Just don‚Äôt let money consume you. I‚Äôve had a lot at times and it never changed the things in me that only letting go and being present (yeah I‚Äôm a Tolle fan) can do. In fact I‚Äôm selling almost everything I own. And it feels great. 

I trust that if I am a good person I will find a place in another good person‚Äôs home. And yeah I‚Äôm now an empty nester 49 yr old woman who is starting to get ignored by men and you know what? I find it entirely liberating to know that the biggest source of pain in my life is gone. 

Be free. Don‚Äôt strive for wealth, it‚Äôs really not as great as it seems. Nor is love. Just do good in the world.

"BABA has nearly doubled from its lowest point. All Chinese stocks have been rallying to the moon. 

Two years ago China was not viewed as uninvestable. Not much has fundamentally changed about the investment system in China. It‚Äôs still authoritarian, VIE structure, the CCP can do what it wants. It‚Äôs always been this way. Yes short term crisis like the real estate bubble and tech crack down have occurred, but China is mostly the same as it was 2 years ago. 

I‚Äôve been pounding sand for months about the amazing opportunity China presents. It was extremely undervalued even with risks considered. Now that I‚Äôve been proven right and China stocks are rocketing, will people finally end this overly pessimistic fear mongering? The choir will come out with the same tired points about how idiotic it is to invest in China. 

As of now, the naysayers have been proven wrong. BABA is performing wonderfully despite the noise. 

I just want to know how much longer the sheep will keep avoiding China before they fomo in. It‚Äôs not to late to jump into Chinas recovery. This is only the beginning of a long rally back to fair value. 

I know most commenters are going to berate me. But to the few wise ones with open minds, consider what the criticism argues vs the current price performance.

"**From the article:** ""Over the past five months (June to November 2022), inflation has slowed to a crawl. Whether measured by the consumer-price index, or CPI, which most people watch, or the price index for personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, which the Federal Reserve prefers, the annualized inflation rate has been around 2.5% over these five months.

Yes, you read that right. Yet hardly anyone has noticed this stunning development because of the near-universal concentration on price changes measured over 12-month periods, which are still 7.1% for CPI inflation and 5.5% for PCE inflation.

Normally, focusing on 12-month inflation rates is the right thing to do, for two main reasons. First, it guards against hyperventilation over ‚Äúblips‚Äù in the inflation data, whether up or down. Second, it obviates the need for seasonal adjustment, since, for example, you are comparing prices in November 2022 with those in November 2021.

But when the inflation rate changes abruptly, 12-month averages can leave you watching recent history rather than current events. Today is one of those times.""

"Under the Accelerated Approval Pathway the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved lecanemab-irmb (Brand Name in the U.S.: LEQEMBI‚Ñ¢), a humanized immunoglobulin gamma 1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody directed against aggregated soluble (""protofibril"")\* and insoluble forms of amyloid beta (AŒ≤) for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). LEQEMBI is indicated for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the U.S. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on reduction in AŒ≤ plaques observed in patients treated with LEQEMBI.

Pricing for the treatment is set at $26,500 per year in U.S. More than 6.5 million people in the U.S. suffers from Alzheimer's, incapacitating the lives of those who suffers from it and with devastating effects on their loved ones. This irreversible disease destroys memory, thinking skills and eventually the ability to carry out simple tasks. 

Analysts estimates that LEQEMBI could take over roughly 11% of the market 3 years after it's launch, driving $18.9 Billion in U.S. sales alone. Globally, nearly 50 million people have Alzheimer‚Äôs or related dementia, potentially bringing in &gt;$100 billion annually (ridiculously basing on the healthcare cost in U.S.). As of the successfully phase 3 results announcement, stock price ($BIIBI) has shot up \~42%. BIIB trading was halted late Friday before the approval announcement was made.

A lot of famous companies didn‚Äôt hire the good webmaster team. They have ALL domain extension (for example mcdonalds.com , mcdonalds.co , mcdonalds.io, etc‚Ä¶) BUT‚Ä¶.

- Trading famous websites .ai

Truth be told - Tesla has the best deals when it comes to EVs. You won't find faster, better EVs with longer range than a Tesla for its price and they've been reducing their price and getting even closer to mid range ICE vehicle prices(imo one key turning point to EV uptake is them being cheap enough to buy as a taxi, and they are very very close).
