I am swapping to text so that I can link the proof that these actions have been completed.""If GameStop takes practical steps to cut its excessive real estate costs and hire the right talent, it will have the resources to begin building a powerful e-commerce platform that provides competitive pricing, broad gaming selection, fast shipping and a truly high-touch experience that excites and delights customers. This is the type of world-class infrastructure that was constructed at Chewy, which is worth multiples of GameStop’s current market capitalization. There is no doubt in our minds that GameStop has the flexibility to evolve into a technology-driven sector leader. As you know: * The Company’s average lease duration is approximately 24 months. Now is the time to identify duplicative, underperforming stores and plan to forgo lease renewals.""If this were true, according to Google we will see a decrease in Operating lease liabilities.

In 2021 that number dropped to ""a total of 4,816 stores across all of our segments"", solid. Now in 2022 we see ""a total of 4,573 stores across all of our segments"". What do y'all think? Cuz I think they delivered on that one.* ""Non-core operations in Europe and Australia can be streamlined or sold in order to reduces losses and potentially generate cash. While the Australian market has shown signs of life, it is not nearly big or strong enough to offset the losses linked to the Company’s hundreds of stores across European nations.""In [2020](https://gamestop.gcs-web.com/static-files/57ac340d-3332-4e3a-a9ec-817bcf8ef0b1) total stores Aus 426 Eur 1142.

"It was a cold and rainy night, alone in my house in full darkness, the only form of light was coming from the TV playing some horror movie, but the true horror was about to hit me soon. A ring from my phone moved my attention from the movie to the notification I just got. It was about my position…I knew this couldn’t be good…A sudden fear and panic started to build inside of me, like I’ve seen a ghost in front of me, but in fact, it was much worse. My trade was negative 231% somehow. I dropped my phone and everything turned slow mode as I’ve just lost all the money I had saved. It was all too much to take…I woke up in sweat and terror. My phone was on the table. Didn’t wait a second and I grabbed it instantly to check my position. I watched the loading circle spinning for so long it felt like it was taking ages. The moment of truth…I sighed in relief as I came to the realization that my position was down only 70%. It felt like a huge weight fell off my shoulders.

"The stock market went up because people expect that wages won't go up as much, which would help the Federal Reserve (the people who control our money) fight against prices going up too much. When the stock market goes up, that means that the value of the companies that make up the stock market are worth more. The dollar went down, which means it's worth less compared to other currencies. The government also sold a lot of bonds, which are a kind of IOU, and the value of those bonds went up. The jobs report came out and it showed that more people got hired than expected, and that unemployment went down a lot. However, wages didn't go up as much as some people expected. This is confusing for the Federal Reserve because they are trying to decide if they should make it harder or easier to borrow money, which could affect how fast prices go up. Some people at the Federal Reserve think they should make it harder to borrow money to slow down prices going up, while others think they should make it easier to borrow money because the job market is doing well. It's confusing for everyone right now because they are trying to figure out what the best thing to do is.https://preview.redd.it/fyma61rv4laa1.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e9327b010734049a078c5825b7dac6c12b22792","El5 Market Recap Monday, January 7, 2023",1,self.wallstreetbets,105ketb,jjd1226,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/105ketb/el5_market_recap_monday_january_7_2023/,1673081543,1298,40,7,216,0.04,0.852,0.108,0.933,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

"2001 -  The premise of today’s values on  Wall Street is that Alan Greenspan, public servant, will be able to do  what no one has ever been able to do before – prevent stock prices from  regressing to the mean.  ‘Information technology’ had a ring to it, but it needed the objective  correlative of higher productivity and economic growth to give it  substance.

"Why do your own DD if you can let ChatGPT bankrupt you without lifting a finger? Plus, it's free - so more money to put into TSLA.FOR:* Apple has a ton of cash (like, $200 billion-worth) and they might as well put it to use by buying Peloton and turning the company's exercise bikes into really expensive iPhone docking stations.* Peloton's stock has been on fire lately, with a market capitalization of over $30 billion. Apple could get in on the action and make a killing (pun intended).* Apple has a history of making smart acquisitions (like when they bought Steve Jobs' garage for a cool $1), and Peloton could be the next big win for the company. Just think of all the bougie tech bros who would pay top dollar for a Peloton-branded Apple Watch.AGAINST:* Apple is known for making shiny gadgets, not sweaty ones. Buying Peloton could be a stretch and take the company out of its comfort zone.* Peloton's business model relies on selling exercise equipment, which doesn't exactly fit with Apple's focus on software and services. It's like if Apple tried to buy a meatpacking plant – it just doesn't make sense.* The price tag for Peloton could be steep, with estimates ranging from $25-40 billion. That's a lot of money to drop on a company that's essentially just a spin class on a bike.

So you know how these conversations go at work. Don’t tell anyone but… well I decided to go to Reddit 😀.My company like many of yours is looking at  reductions in work forces and under resourced programs . We had a huge war chest of cash due built up in earlier years. Since COVID our supply chains are strapped. We ship some of the product but can’t invoice because of supply chain issues. Need customer sign off after all deliverables etcI won’t say the name of the company. Regardless we will figure out how to solve our issue but it got me to thinking this could be a symptom of a broader issue and have market implications. I’m a wannabe Ape and my son got me into your sub and thought it may help some of you decide on what you want to do with your portfolio.  If we are burning down cash and unable to invoice because of supply chain issues what happens if COVID hits China hard and further impacts global supply chains ?

"With things like climate change, water shortages, rising demand for single family shelters. You would think I would be hearing more about the potential for a big new market in housing speculation.

Now people love their future bargaining potential and it just creates a lot more ""wealth"" when adding in speculative value.

"Good news is good news and bad news is good news as they say… &amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/gsnjwz8kwiaa1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64d5570360a075172ec9cf52504563d279e2f6f1Overnight I mentioned I had expected a lower than expected UE rate and that I had anticipated with the way we are focusing on the labor market recently that we should see a big red opening because of that. Well low and behold I was correct about the UE rate which came in at 3.5%... but what I did not expect was for markets to take the average hourly earnings (wage growth) that slightly dropped and jump back on the bull train. That’s the hardest part about swing trades and the even harder part about swing trading data days. We can have the perfect analysis and the perfect play only for the algos to choose not to react how they have previously. For instance this was first time since April (8 readings between then and now) that a lower than expected UE opened with a green day. Sucks to lose a trade but in the end we have to take the high probability plays. The nature of the beast is we cant win them all. &amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/a3tvuplkwiaa1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aab2eb98e8d9747d8788bbb41e23a0b4c995380fTaking a zoomed out look here. We are now approaching 4 days out from the next CPI reading on Thursday. The previous two CPI readings have had pretty significant drops leading into the actual reading (usually happening 3-6 days prior). The last time we had a rally into a CPI was back in September. However, the August reading also had a pretty significant run up and then consolidation prior to the CPI reading. &amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/lrwu7a2lwiaa1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2cb2638f55540db21dc977ebf7b806a438044a6If you remember last night I talked about the fact that we have been holding these $10 ranges and that all but 6 or 7 days total over the last 36-37 trading days have occurred within a $10 range of eachother. I also mentioned that we needed to see a breakout of the triangle and a breakout of this blue consolidation range. Granted I was bearish that we would get a bad UE and that would start our leg down into the 360-370 range… however, I mentioned a good reading would get us a nice 1% open near 383 (opened at 382.61) and that I would look for a push to the top of the channel. I did not expect bulls to find a 2.3% green type of day today but the bulls came out in full force. So where does this leave us? We can say that this blue channel is officially broke and we have confirmed 4x now that the red support line is indeed support. With a breakout of the resistance side of the channel and closing over the blue channel resistance for the first time since December 15th this should lead to a recovery back over 390 next week. That means we very well could see a run up into CPI instead of the usual sell off. However, we need to recognize how strong of a level 390.1 is and that we very well could see a pretty major rejection there Monday. My initial thoughts are that the bulls are going to make a move to get us back into the that 392 to 302 channel from before previous CPI. However, if the bears can defend 390.1 resistance we just might fight ourselves seeing that pre-cpi sell off and landing right back in this 376 to 386 channel next week. The biggest bullish catalyst from a technical standpoint is that this is the first time we have close back over the daily 20ema since December 14th (day after CPI). &amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/gk2lzillwiaa1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c7189cc9f406b773424a90673dbfb02b7935d066Taking a look at the SPY weekly chart here I mentioned these $10 ranges and something I have been wondering if we might actually be trading in a wider $20-$30 range. The key weekly levels I have our 375.6 -&gt; 390 -&gt; 408.8 that we have been bouncing between since the week of October 24th. I mentioned that I believed 2023 could be the year of consolidation and range until we see a significant enough of a catalysts. What if we actually our trading in a wider $375.6 to $408.8 range with $390 being our pivot? That gives us a total range of about $33 or about 9% total of movement. With $390 being our pivot we have an $18 upside and about a $15 down side. &amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/ojpwwq2mwiaa1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=783b1b2faf2c88744a51afbb14750be83cbb2d2aIn the above screenshot I have highlighted this $375 to $408 range. If we look at it since May all but 10 weeks (35 total trading weeks) have closed within that $33 range. That means 71.4% of the last 35 weeks of trading has all happened within the same $33 range of eachother. We could even go further to se that 363.8 to 427.5 is our expected range for 2023. Looking back we have seen all but 3 of the last 38 weeks of trading close within the same $363.8 to $427.5 (about $64 range) range. That means 92.1% of the trading over the last 38 weeks (or about 9.5 months) have all happened within the same $64 range. This should be our expectation of a range for 2023. The one thing that is very clear from these ranges is that $390 is our pivot point. Over $390 we push for $408.8 -&gt; $427.5….. below $390 we push for $375.6 -&gt; $363.8. That brings us back to todays close for the daily and weekly. WE did touch $390 after hours but we did not quite get to or over $390. We should officially test that Monday. A breakout over $390 would signal that we are headed back to $408.8 area and a good CPI reading (consensus came out very bullishly today) could push us to $427.5. However, a rejection Monday at $390 and we should start thinking about a retracement back to $375.6 area going into CPI Thursday. That CPI could very well be the catalyst to push markets back up. The thoughts I have here are as we break under $390 once we cross under $383 start sizing into a 30-60dte call position… at $375.6 we should be almost fully into the call position. If we touch $363.8 we should fully be in calls. And the opposite for puts. $393 should be where we start loading 30-60dte puts…. Almost fully in puts at $408.8 and if we ever touched $427.5 we should be heavily in 30-60dte PUTs… $390 is no mans land in my opinion. This new consolidation channel being recognized along with that break through the 2022 bear channel resistance line back on last CPI brings up the question of whether we are still in a down trend or if we are in a sideways trend. Key weekly support- 383.1 -&gt; 375.6   key weekly resistance- 390.1 -&gt; 398.9&amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/p2e5n5nmwiaa1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54cacc7030a1af9a53f7b392c3b61e67ddfce1cbFlipping over to futures here we can see a very similar pattern. Honestly the futures daily chart is what first put me on to this $wider $20-$30 range that SPY has been trading within.Today held that key 3830 support area, broke through key 3872 resistance, broke the resistance line of that triangle, closed direction at the channel resistance of 3915 and closed back inside the 3910 to 4100 channel. &amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/v3cm2b6nwiaa1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=153cce549e3957fc53a3e5a360e14cef53e0d2deTaking a look at the futures weekly here I am eyeing a nice 3770 to 4095 channel formed here…. This would be similar to that $375.6 to $408.8 channel on SPY. With the pivot on futures being $3910. Shortside resistance is 3970 and short side support is 3860. This would be mean to me that 3860 to 3970 really is no mans land. But the same thing should apply to futures break 3910 -&gt; 3970 -&gt; 4095… reject 3910 -&gt; 3860 -&gt; 3770. You could play these levels in a similar 30-60dte manner as SPY. This is our third gravestone doji weekly candle with a wicks huge wicks to the downside. However, this week is the first time that we have seen price action close back over the weekly 8ema and test the weekly 20ema.  With a close back over 3910 we should be looking for a push to 3970 minimally this week. With a run up to CPI and a good CPI print we could be eyeing that 4095 level within the next 2 weeks. However, if we lose 3910 Monday we very well could see that sell off into CPI and look for CPI to be the bullish catalyst to push us back higher. Key weekly support- 3910 -&gt; 3860 -&gt; 3770   key weekly resistance- 3970 -&gt; 4095&amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/5p37lnqnwiaa1.png?width=767&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9fd5e771df389e56f5973fa833a56188fd4b48ebTaking a look at the Tesla cycle chart we put in a 4 day -18.2% sell off on Tesla. And may I just say that was one hell of an impressive recovery today! -9% I believe to closing almost 3% green… a solid 12% swing intraday… When we look at the cycles assuming today was the bottom… we should be looking for about a 3.8 day 14.2% push to the upside… That limits us to about 116.5 area using todays low. However, I am eyeing a possible consolidation channel forming. &amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/tpawmr5owiaa1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=996cb6e09e7ac35a41e99004e6a60ff4eded81d3It has been a little while since we have seen Tesla hold one of these consolidation channels and actually was expecting $108-$110 to be that support area. However, with todays breakdown we could be looking at a $102.9 to $123.1 channel. $123.1 will be a big resistance area if we were to go and test that as you can see after establishing it as resistance on 12/23 we reconfirmed it as resistance on 12/30. We had nearly a two day bullish engulfing candle on Tesla today. Despite the back to back inside days which should have led to consolidation Tesla was able to find a very big support bounce. I remain bullish on Tesla going into next week. I would like to see an official retest of this daily 8ema which should be near 115.7 on Monday. However we have not touched the daily 20ema since December 5th. I think this is an overdue support bounce. With presumably no bad news coming for Tesla until earnings on the 25th and presumably with SPY going for a decent run back to the 400s we could see Tesla receive much like today a nice sympathy bounce/ rally. &amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/8lj4wioowiaa1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a39b9c11e07cc30537ad97cc463f66c457f1693eTaking a look at the Tesla weekly here the biggest bullish case I see for tesla is that this is now the 2nd week in a row that tesla has attempted to break down below 111.4 support and has failed to close below it. This support if you remember was established back in August of 2020. With this support holding, back to back hanging man candles on the weekly and presumably a bullish market week we very well may see tesla go and attempt to test the resistance of this rising wedge channel. Key support- 111.4 -&gt; 94.4   key resistance- 122.6 -&gt; 150&amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/r9idtzqqwiaa1.png?width=615&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1147d1d392de3a2d1bcd0949cbd6b47cf89ec900The VIX here is signaling also a bullish momentum for next week. Interestingly enough I mentioned that yesterday was the first time the daily 8 and daily 20ema had crossed over since October 24th. However, that appears to have been a fake crossover and now we are finding ourselves closed back under the daily 8 and 20ema. The structure of the VIX looks like we very well might go back for a test of 19.7 key support early next week before we presumably get a nice spike leading into CPI. I have been waiting for a 390.1 support retest since we broke it middle of December and I believe we finally get it. My thoughts remain break through and close (this is important) over 390.1 Monday and we most likely see a nice run up into CPI on Thursday. However, a rejection at 390.1 or failure to even test it Monday when we are $2 away would signal a return to that 380-383 magnet area. **Daily Log-**Overall a red day but a meh day too. I swung some Home Depot puts overnight (a little off caliber play for the UE numbers to avoid SPYs crazy premiums…. Which was the correct move considering this nearly 1% move on SPY barely netted 30% for most of those who swang calls)… I was down a decent amount at open. The spreads were extremely wide at open and once I was able to finally get a fill HD went on a pretty impressive dump. Had I held for 5 minutes total I woulda been breakeven… had I held for 30 minutes it woulda been 115%+ gains. Just the way the cookie crumbles sometimes…The most frustrating part of today was the fact that I made profits on 3 put plays on the run up and managed to get stopped out on two calls plays on the run up. Taking a loss on calls on a very green day like this is highly frustrating. But trend days are always my least favorite days to trade. &amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/erzqx0qpwiaa1.png?width=747&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a976abacfb7d9b83fd91a5a689012ca749591a35Not a big green week to start things off but nonetheless a green week.

I asked my grandparents for a small donation of $12k and lost all of that too.I then took a loan of $20k with the $5k I had from saving to unlock infinite day trades thinking I could make it all back. I proceed to lose all of that too. Now I’m in debt and work a 9-5 trying to get back in the game.I learned a lot from all these terrible choices. I realized I’m a gambler who belongs here and don’t know if I’ll make it in this game or not. I wish I could go back in time and not take the loans, but Its too late now. I wasted 4 years of my life trading and at this rate will continue to waste another 4. Thanks for reading, I just wanted to get this off my chest. Don’t make the mistake or it will come back to bite you later. I lost good relationships and hard earned money through options and it sucks a lot.Don’t take money from anyone for gambling in options.

"As some of you may know, when sentiment is overly biased on a single asset, such as the SPY or QQQ, brokers like to harvest the return to equilibrium. This happens all the time in the stock market. People call it stop hunting or ""pulling the rug"" on inexperienced traders. Today was particularly bloody for anyone that was short today, in this case, the majority. **Why am I always getting f\*\*\*\*\*\* by the market exactly when I buy anything?**Well, first of all. The data centers that run all U.S. markets, located in the Northeast, are built and operated by some *really smart motherfuckers.* They can literally see everything about you in real-time. When you have your trading terminal open, what tickers you are watching, how much you have in your account, where your mouse and keyboard are pointing, and your historical trading patterns. It's not one dude spying on you, it's a huge array of supercomputers that have enough power to predict what you are going to do and if it would be profitable or not to trade against you. This is why we hear the old saying, ""always bet against the crowd.""**How do I beat these so-called master algorithms?**You don't need to beat the computers. You just need to beat the crowd. If you think like everyone else, you will lose more money. You need to be patient and buy when markets are sinking. Sell when markets are strong. Pay attention to the overall trend. Right now, the Federal Banks are trying to restrict spending. This means that over the year, the stock market is going to stay flat or keep going down, with the exception of some sectors. Yes, there will be ups and downs, but basic Dow theory states that up-days will be smaller and occur less frequently than down-days in a downtrend.**How do I grow my capital wicked fast?**If you really want to grow peanuts, you need to be aggressive. A good 2-3% day on the QQQ will net you multiples of two to three with short-dated options contracts. You want to be fighting the short-term price action, like what happened today, and riding lower lows. If you're afraid of trading that hard, then you really are a poor sucker. Losing a couple grand is not going to have a major effect on your life. Otherwise, you are wasting time and should just get a job. **What is good inversing?**Inversing is when you hear or see an idea that makes sense, but still take the opposing view. It's actually a useful social skill, beautiful women do it all of the time because of the bullshit they have to deal with. Anyways, if you see this sub getting overly excited about being short or long, the following session will more than likely move the other way. This has to do with cascading information. We can always assume that the worst traders, people like us, are last to the party. If we know that we are likely to be wrong, it's smart to deny the first impulse that comes to mind. This is how all good traders think. If you are worried about a position, that's a good thing. If you think that a trade is free money, you're going to lose.**What's the poop desk up to?**I work at a poop desk, which means that I get to work swanky, sweaty, try-hard traders. They think that a recession is going to happen. Not only that, but the war could get worse too. That's a double whammy for anyone that isn't long bonds. It's going to be a slow year for small-caps and growth stocks. Be careful with DOOM calls and 0DTEs. Today was a big exception, I missed the run-up but was able to get a good position with weekly puts on the QQQ. We treat money like a videogame. None of us are attached to the value of our trading accounts. All we care about is learning how to improve and being right about future events and prices.

"*Hello Investors! I am presenting you with this sector research that i did for the Lithium Market. Have a nice reading session!*# Table of Contents* Introduction* Lithium Locations* Top Lithium Reserves Currently known* How Lithium is produced* Top Producers of Lithium* Prices in China* Lithium Price Drivers* Important points to consider for the lithium market.* Criticism to Lithium ExtractionsIn the late 1980s, the discovery of Lithium’s efficiency in the storage of energy for the construction of electric batteries helped to increase the demand of this precious metal in the last decades, even today the demand is not ceding. Compared to other materials, Lithium can store lots of energy in a tiny space, making it ideal for consumer electronics and EVs.Worldwide production in 2021 increased by 21% to approximately 100,000 tons from 82,500 tons in 2020 in response to strong demand from the consumer electronics market due to the Covid-19 pandemic’s lockdowns and increased prices of lithium. Global consumption in 2021 was estimated to be 93,000 tons, a 33% increase from 70,000 tons in 2020.The metal’s global end-use is conveyed as follow:* 74% batteries;* 4% ceramics and glass;* 3% lubricating greases;* 2% continuous casting mold flux powders;* 2% polymer production;* 1% air treatment;* 4% and other uses.Lithium consumption for batteries has increased significantly in recent years because rechargeable lithium batteries are used extensively in the growing market for electric vehicles and portable electronic devices, increasingly used in electric tools, and grid storage applications. Lithium is extracted from:* Lithium oxide and hydroxide* Lithium carbonate* Lithium-cobalt oxide* Lithium-nickel-cobalt-aluminum oxide# Lithium LocationsFour mineral operations in Australia, two brine operations each in Argentina and Chile, and two brine and one mineral operation in China accounted for the majority of world lithium production. Additionally, smaller operations in Brazil, China, Portugal, the United States, and Zimbabwe also contributed to world production of this strategic resource.Lithium supply security has become a top priority for technology companies’ strategic alliances and joint ventures among tech firms and exploration companies continued to be established to ensure a reliable, diversified supply of lithium for battery suppliers and vehicle manufacturers. Substitution for lithium compounds is possible in batteries, ceramics, greases, and manufactured glass. Examples are calcium, magnesium, mercury, and zinc as anode material in primary batteries; calcium and aluminum soaps as substitutes for stearates in greases; and sodic and potassic fluxes in ceramics and glass manufacture.|**Brine Base Lithium Sources**|**Mineral Base Lithium Sources**|**Lithium Clay Source**|**Searlesite Sources**||:-|:-|:-|:-||Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, China, and the United States|Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Congo (Kinshasa), Czechia, Finland, Germany, Mali, Namibia, Peru, Portugal, Serbia, Spain, the United States, and Zimbabwe|Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Congo (Kinshasa), Czechia, Finland, Germany, Mali, Namibia, Peru, Portugal, Serbia, Spain, the United States, and Zimbabwe Mexico and the United States|United States|# Top Lithium Reserves Currently known:1.

Portugal:  60,000 MTChile has the most reserve of economically extractable lithium in the world, estimating for around a 37% of global reserves. SQM (NSYE:SQM) is a key lithium producer in Chile’s Salar de Atacama, and in 2018 it finally reached a long-awaited agreement with Corfo, the country’s development agency, over royalties. Albemarle (NYSE:ALB) is another top lithium producer in Chile.# How Lithium is producedPut simply, lithium from Australia comes from ore mining, while in Chile and Argentina, lithium comes from salt deserts, so-called salars. The extraction of raw materials from salars functions as follows: lithium-containing saltwater from underground lakes is brought to the surface and evaporates in large basins. The remaining saline solution is further processed in several stages until the lithium is suitable for use in batteries.# Top Producers of Lithium1. **Jiangxi Ganfeng Lithium Co. Ltd (SHE:002460).** The company has acquisitions in Mexico, Ireland and Australia.

Spodumene, a lithium source gemstone, was selling for $450 per ton in january 2022 to about $2,300 in November 2022. Lithium metal was selling for $77,000 per ton in China to 97,000 per ton in July 2022.# Lithium Price DriversThe lithium market is changing and the battery boom is the primary driver of this. The way physical market participants price lithium is evolving, with increased monitoring of spot-based price movements having an evermore profound impact on contract negotiations.Lithium pricing trends are deeply rooted in the transportation segment’s ongoing shift toward electrification. In recent years, accommodative government policy, declining costs, consumer preference, and technological improvement have supported rapidly increasing adoption of electric vehicles. So far lithium supply have not kept pace with the surge in demand. It is expected for the lithium market to enter a supply deficit state for several years, presenting opportunities for the mining companies that dictate supply.Surging demand for EVs and the inelastic nature of lithium supply are the primary drivers behind the increase in lithium prices in 2022.Supply is unlikely to grow in lockstep with demand through the first half of the decade, likely generating deficits that could support elevated lithium pricing. Elevated lithium pricing has generally translated into strong results for lithium miners in recent quarters, including Albemarle, SQM, and Ganfeng.Lithium prices have surged more than 120% year-to-date and are up as much as 10x versus historical levels, according to the Benchmark Minerals Intelligence lithium price index.Miners are hesitant to boost production, fearing that flooding the market with supply could push the prices down. For example, this scenario occurred between 2015 and 2018 when miners hiked lithium production in anticipation of rapid EV sales growth in the immediate term. This speculation turned out to be premature, leading to lithium price volatility during that period.# Important points to consider for the lithium market.* Lithium oversupply and slow downstream demand are weighing on lithium prices in China after material supply grew faster than demand.* During periods of high price volatility, producers and consumers negotiate more regularly to control the price risks of procuring lithium* Some consumers are procuring part of their material as a long-term contract as well as on spot to control the price risk.* Global lithium prices should follow China’s spot market.# Criticism to Lithium ExtractionsThere are critical reports on the extraction of lithium from salars: locals complain about increasing droughts, which threatens livestock farming or crops failures. It is still unclear to what extent the drought is actually related to lithium mining even though no drinking water is needed for the lithium production itself. What is disputed, on the other hand, is the extent to which the extraction of saltwater leads to an influx of fresh water and thus influences the groundwater at the edge of the salars.","Overview of the Lithium Market - production, location and main producers",1,self.wallstreetbets,1056849,Charoenlai,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1056849/overview_of_the_lithium_market_production/,1673040823,11287,72,11,1674,0.03,0.884,0.086,0.9979,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

"Correct me if I am wrong if my understanding of naked short-selling is wrong.Naked short-selling involves a borrower requesting shares from a lender to sell and repurchase at a later time. In order to borrow and sell shares, the borrower must agree to a borrow rate while borrowing/selling the security. If the borrower receives shares that don't technically exist, this is because the lender has yet to receive a real share that exists yet (hence an FTD). The lender knows real shares should come around eventually to fill the order. Thus the borrower sells a fake share initially, receives money for it like it's a real one and the price of the stock reflects an increase in supply (lowers the price). If there doesn't happen to be any real shares the lender can provide, well, it just get's registered as an FTD till it does. This process can happen a million times over without any oversight. If the price of the stock goes up by x percent, the borrower can be margin called giving the lender the legal authority to liquidate said holdings plus any other holdings to make up for the loss. Is this about right?Also...1. Why does the overall float never reflected the added FTD shares used in shorting even though the price changes when supply does?2. If a company goes bankrupt and naked shares were sold into the float, does that mean there will be more shares available than what was originally released into the secondary market? For example, if BBBY goes bankrupt, there would be the shares the company originally released plus any additional shares that were FTD yet used for short-selling purposes. If this addition of FTD shares is astronomical, say, 100000% of the original float, would that draw attention to the SEC? Or are additional shares masked somehow? 3.

"There are lots of bullish arguments to make for solar stocks this year, including the Inflation Reduction Act and global demand, especially in Europe. California-based Sunrun designs, installs, sells and maintains residential solar panels directly to customers. Other business areas include battery storage, leasing energy services, and a ""virtual power plant"" with installed Sunrun panels actually exporting energy back to the grid. Relatively few homes have solar panels installed, but homeowners are increasingly interested in them and associated tax benefits, making growth potential in this area of the clean energy market quite high.Sunrun recently secured $835 million in non-recourse financing to support its growth. This financing includes a $600 million syndicated bank facility for a portfolio of leases and power purchase agreements, and a $235 million non-recourse subordinated financing. The $575 million senior loan was priced at a credit spread of 212.5 basis points to the Daily Simple Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) and had a fixed base rate of 3.49% with a total initial swapped senior loan cost of debt of 5.62%. Sunrun reported a networked solar energy capacity of 5,392 MW in its third quarter, with 255.8 MW of installations during that same period. [Source: RenewablesNow](https://renewablesnow.com/news/sunrun-raises-usd-835m-in-financing-810487/)# FundamentalsSunrun generates revenue through the sale of solar energy systems and the sale of the electricity generated by those systems to homeowners. The company also generates revenue through the sale of excess electricity back to the grid. Sunrun has a strong financial track record, with revenue growing consistently in recent years. In 2020, the company reported revenue of $2.9 billion, up from $2.5 billion in 2019.Sunrun has also been successful in expanding its customer base, with the company serving over 500,000 customers as of the end of 2020. In addition to its strong financial performance, Sunrun has also been recognized for its commitment to sustainability and environmental responsibility, with the company being named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the past several years.[RUN weekly chart](https://preview.redd.it/cxewt5b7dgaa1.png?width=2428&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ab1bff4e3780b7867079a8be5fbcc6aca550252)Technically-minded traders might wonder if RUN stock will repeat its falling wedge pattern, and possibly even see a double bottom forming.

It expects to sell “a portion” of those securities in 2023, to pay down its $6.7 billion wholesale funding ($2.4 billion brokered CDs and $4.3 billion FHL Bank advances). And so it will recognize the anticipated losses as an “impairment charge” in Q4.Since these securities are now held “for sale” instead of “hold till maturity,” it may have to mark to market even the securities that it doesn’t immediately sell, bringing the total write-down possibly to as much as $300 million.""Regarding the 718million loss they reported today, this was a duration mismatch...they got customer deposits a year or whatever ago, bought bonds, now customers are panic withdrawing and Silvergate is forced to sell those bonds and recognize losses on them.

Following the legalization of recreational cannabis and hemp in Mexico, the firm launched its development plan by acquiring trademark rights in the nation, which opened doors to new commercial prospects. A customer in New Mexico has already placed a $527,000 purchase order for Cartel Blue's boutique, indoor-grown hemp cigars. In addition, $CRTL will be negotiating a $137,500 purchase order for our new Cartel cigarillos, which is expected to extend until 2023.Cartel Blue is a constantly growing company. It is a quality-based company that believes that maintaining good quality over quantity is more important.* The Cartel blue cigars are the finest hemp cigars ever made.* All the hemp that is used in Cartel cigars is grown in an Indore environment.* All the Cartel blue cigars are handmade and checked thoroughly for quality purposes.Cartel Blue is one of the fastest-growing cigar brands in the United States.

On 7/5 BBBY bond prices reached a new low of $34 par value which it revisited to close out the quarter. Let's say RC dumped the entire value into bonds at $34 par value, this would give him $411M in bond value. I guess that's close enough to the extra 600k in long term debt Cohencidentally appearing the same quarter he sold his stock position.I know that he is in a position to force the board to do his bidding because he did the exact same thing with GME's board.

It expects to sell “a portion” of those securities in 2023, to pay down its $6.7 billion wholesale funding ($2.4 billion brokered CDs and $4.3 billion FHL Bank advances). And so it will recognize the anticipated losses as an “impairment charge” in Q4.Since these securities are now held “for sale” instead of “hold till maturity,” it may have to mark to market even the securities that it doesn’t immediately sell, bringing the total write-down possibly to as much as $300 million.""Regarding the 718million loss they reported today, this was a duration mismatch...they got customer deposits a year or whatever ago, bought bonds, now customers are panic withdrawing and Silvergate is forced to sell those bonds and recognize losses on them.

"Bed Bath &amp; Beyond warned Thursday it’s running out of cash and is considering bankruptcy.The retailer, citing worse-than-expected sales, issued a “going concern” warning that in the upcoming months it likely will not have the cash to cover expenses, such as lease agreements or payments to suppliers. Bed Bath said it is exploring financial options, such as restructuring, seeking additional capital or selling assets, in addition to a potential bankruptcy.Shares of the company fell about 30% to close the day at $1.69 after Bed Bath issued the updates in a pair of financial filings. The stock earlier touched a 52-week low earlier in the day. Its market value has fallen to about $149 million as of Thursday’s close.Still, CEO Sue Gove said the retailer is focused on rebuilding the business and making sure its brands, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, Buybuy Baby and Harmon, “remain destinations of choice for customers well into the future.”Among its challenges, Bed Bath said it is having trouble getting enough merchandise to fill its shelves and is drawing fewer customers to its stores and website.The retailer also said it wasn’t able to refinance a portion of its debt, less than a month after notifying investors it planned to borrow more in order to pay off chunks of existing obligations.Bed Bath’s debt load has been weighing on the company. The retailer has nearly $1.2 billion in unsecured notes, which have maturity dates spread across 2024, 2034 and 2044. In recent quarters, Bed Bath has warned it’s been quickly burning through cash.Bed Bath’s notes have all been trading below par, a sign of financial distress.Full article: [https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/05/bed-bath-beyond-shares-plummet-as-company-warns-of-deeper-financial-troubles.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/05/bed-bath-beyond-shares-plummet-as-company-warns-of-deeper-financial-troubles.html)Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY) shares have fallen 32% this week after the company warned that it’s running out of cash and is considering bankruptcy.

"Interesting Tickers on the move TL:DR|Trading Thesis: Tracking the float along with daily volume along with company financials helps to narrow down moving tickersFundamental and technical analysis is often used to find growth tickers and information about them. Fundamental analysis looks to see whether an investment is overvalued or undervalued based on underlying economic conditions, as well as the finances of the company or other organization that issued a stock or bond. Technical analysis instead looks at patterns in the price of an investment to predict future movements in that investment’s price.I look for tickers that are trading at least 2 million in volume a day, with a market-cap of no less than 500 million.The shares traded are compared to the average volume to determine how much of the float is used (Or shares traded). That information is compiled with data on how profitable the company is and how much cash do they have compared to what is expected.|:--||Uptrending Tickers\&amp;nbsp;||BABA 1/20/23 115C 1.64||TMUS 1/20/23 150C 1.07||RRC 1/20/23 26C .30||DAL 1/20/23 35C 1.37||NVDA 1/20/23 160C 1.24||MCHP 1/20/23 72C 1.10||DQ. 1/20/23 40C .80||Downtrending Tickers\&amp;nbsp;||BYND 1/20/23 13P 1.29||SI 1/20/23 13P 1.20\&amp;nbsp;||Things to consider when finding the plays-&lt;/span&gt;· If the stock volume has traded 1 million or more in volume premarket, I will use that and calculate a rough estimate on what the stock will trade for the day.&lt;/span&gt;· If the ticker looks to be trading more volume than the day before, I will consider it for a long play.

" After being fed up of always getting liquating and being stop loss hunted I got fed up. I was down to my last $1.5 in my crypto trading account. I decided to spend yesterday drawing all the resistance on my chart I could possible draw, back testing, seeing what happened in the past based on this scenarios. I had created a pinpoint accuracy of what the market will do (crypto ticker). I said well this is it. I successfully deposited another $25 into my trading account and kept my patience until the green candle hit my pin point resistance level because I saw the dip coming. That was it! I successfully shorted the top using only $14 out of the $25 and I made $10. I was proud of myself. I closed my position with a %80 gain. I went to take a nap as a happy man. I had a dream that fox news invited me to for the investing segment because I turned $14 into $250k. They were asking all sort of questions. then... I woke up.....After the previous successful night I decided to give it another shot. I watch the screen for hours upon hours waiting for another green candle to hit my resistance level. the green candle didnt.... All while I'm still seeing the dip coming. during this week to next week. I decided to instead of waiting for the green candle to hit my resistance I will ride the green cnadle up for minimal profil, i mean 50% is 50%...oh i forgot to tell you guys I'm using 25x. so the green candle became a red candle and candled all the way to my support line. I SLAPPED THE MARKET LONG. that was it I was in the trade, I decided in order for me to not get rekt again I will use a small stoploss.. so I did. I set my SL and my TP. The marekt went ahead and continued to candle away and hit my stoploss to the tick after 20 seconds of pondering of whether or not I just enter this trade...it bounced back up after hitting my SL to the tick. I was out of my trade and I was out of my previous profit. I was back to square one. I immediately closed trading view. I went back to doing my work. I decided that I will forever be poor and in order for my to buy a lambo I will save $50 every month until the days the nurse will have to whip my ass.......",well that jsut happened,1,self.wallstreetbets,104ro63,porula,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/104ro63/well_that_jsut_happened/,1673003771,2164,23,4,428,0.018,0.891,0.091,0.9814,0.0,0.588,0.412,0.2732

"It's shocking how few people (analysts) have mentioned Coinbase's revenue segmentation and fee structure. Here's a look at Coinbase's revenue from their previous quarter:  Retail: $26B volume and 346M in revenue (roughly 1.5% fee)  Institutional: $133B volume and (pathetic) 20M revenue (.015% fee)  1.5% fees are insane and Coinbase Pro (now Advanced Trading) had .6% taker fees as the highest possible fee. This illustrates just how much of their revenue is a result of uninformed user paying super high fees. The fees are unsustainable. Simply moving to ""Pro"" which is really just a link you click and KYC would lower revenue by at least 50%.  Traditional brokers have had more or less no problem moving to free trading, and the spreads are definitely not 1.5%+ just to make up for that ""freebie"". There is no reason to think crypto will be any different in the end. Fees will continue to collapse and likely also go to ""free"".  This also comes at a time when volume has completely collapsed. Coinbase volume is public. It's more or less already known how badly it has fallen. Couple falling volume with falling trading fee rates and you have the perfect storm for earnings.  As it stands now, I believe the vast majority of Coinbase's valuation should just be in their ownership of Circle (and potential earnings on reserves) and their user base/brand as an acquisition target. If you believe crypto will actually go mainstream, then you should believe that there will be tons of ETFs that can just be traded for free by people with Ameritrade, e-trade, ML, whatever. There will be no reason for anyone to deal with CB if they can just get exposure via free trading of ETFs through their traditional broker.  In short, Coinbase is fucked. Not only are you subject to the shit trading model, but you are also subject to the crypto asset price declines.  Coinbase goes down just as much as crypto, but never goes up as much as crypto. There is really no reason to own Coinbase if you can just buy Bitcoin. Coinbase has the same or worse downside, with absolutely worse upside.  Coinbase is barely more than an acquisition target for its user base. Can get plenty of return on reserve from other financial institutions if you just want exposure to short term interest rates.",COIN is still at risk of a huge drop given its revenue makeup,1,self.wallstreetbets,104qfqq,throwaway1177171728,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/104qfqq/coin_is_still_at_risk_of_a_huge_drop_given_its/,1672999318,2275,61,13,400,0.091,0.848,0.061,-0.8136,0.271,0.581,0.148,-0.2263

My point is that they could have prime day 24/7 365 in 2023 and revenue would inevitably go up, but your eps yield on your own money would be incredibly negative because you'd be spending $5 on shipping for every $1 in additional revenue.

"Operating income for amazon for all of 2021 was $24.8B on revenue of $469B. Operating income for the TTM is $12.9B on total revenue of $502B. I suspect, as I've been saying for the past year, 2021 will be the highest pure eps for Amazon for at least 2021-2025. Despite it's more than 50% decline in stock price, it's PE ratio has pushed up to 74 because it's earnings have been absolutely decimated. The difficult part for amazon is that it's about to lap Q4 2021 where it netted $11.8B from it's Rivian investment to prop up the eps by a huge magnitude. In Q4 2022 it'll prob take a roughly $700M-$1B loss again from Rivian, but this time it's operating income may also be down. That could cause a MASSIVE shortfall in terms of eps for the TTM. Think about it, in Q3 2022 it's eps were $0.28, then in Q2 2022 they were ($0.20), Q1 2022 ($0.38), and the dangerous part (like I said), in Q4 2021 they were $1.39 because of Rivian. So, if you look at the trailing 3 quarters because those are what matter (for a TTM PE ratio), you are down a negative ($0.30) eps. Do you think Tesla will have a GAAP eps of greater than $0.30? Remember that it's going to take another +/-$1B loss from rivian.

"Bullard has been a pretty big hawk over the past 2 years and has been out in front of most of the other Fed Presidents in terms of interest rate hikes and the serious nature of our inflation problems. So why the dovish tone today? Sure, it was not exactly an over the top dovish speech, but one that definitely was not overly pessimistic and had moments of optimism.  My take, something could be breaking in the financial system because of the severe pessimism people have in the upcoming economy, and those fears are compounding an already existing issue with the swift interest rate hikes. Think an old style run on the banks but in a modern form.  Was Bullard sent out to send a calming message?  If so, will it hold, or will the underlying problem continue to get worse regardless? Either way, I don't see this as a bullish sign, and that is what the market realized too when it sold off after its initial pump.

"-Crack spread: price of gasoline less cost of oil. This is how oil refineries make $$$-Oil and gasoline are priced based on the laws of supply and demand. Their supply is not the same, and neither is their demand. The price of one can go up while the price of the other goes down. Crack spreads widen and contract.-Refineries basically run at full capacity. Once the assets are in service, it really doesn’t make sense to idle them unless oil cost exceeds gasoline price.-More oil supply does not create more gasoline because refineries already run at capacity (se above)Now imagine that the government dumps a whole bunch of oil supply on the market via the SPR. Does this create more gasoline and reduce gas prices? No, because it does not create more gasoline, and it does not change gasoline demand. What effect does it have? It widens the crack spread by reducing the cost of oil and creates record profits for refineries. This was summer 2022.Now imagine the government wants to do the opposite: refill the SPR. What will result?  The opposite: lower crack spreads because it will increase the cost of oil and will have no impact on gasoline supply or demand. This will be summer 2023. Throw into the mix that we won’t have consumers blowing stimulus cash on post-covid revenge travel; gasoline prices fall. This would be a double whammy.2022 saw a perfect mix of conditions which resulted in very profitable crack spreads; unfortunately, perfection does not exist in perpetuity.

"Has anyone read Elon Musk's contract for the $12.5B debt he incurred to purchase TWTR? [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000110465922048128/tm2213229d1\_ex99-d.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000110465922048128/tm2213229d1_ex99-d.htm)I would refer you to A-2 where the LTV ratios are set out. Basically, he needs to maintain a collateral stock value of 15% of his obligation-less-cash if he wants to offset the debt as he pleases. Put differently, if he put up $2.5B in cash initially, he would have needed to put up at least $66.7B in stock to retain the ability to sell-and-offer-as-additional-collateral that stock-turned-cash, and that's assuming the stock price didn't drop as a consequence of his sale (which it would).Here's a little simulation: if he put up nothing but TSLA as collateral on Oct 27, 2022, and left himself a 3% margin (so, $104.2B against $12.5B obligation, thus 12% LTV ratio), he would have hit the 15% threshold at a TSLA price of $180 (it was $225 on 10/27). He then sold $3.95B on Nov 8, 2022 when TSLA was at $200, $20 over the threshold. With this sale, the new threshold for 12% would be a TSLA price of $160 (given that his obligation-less-cash was, in this hypothetical, then $8.55B). Lo-and-behold, around Dec 15, when TSLA was hovering at $160, he sold an additional $3.6B of TSLA, reducing his obligation-less-cash to $4.95B. If Mr. Musk wants to maintain a 12%-or-less LTV ratio, this puts his next sale at a TSLA price of $98.Given that TSLA is currently hovering at $110, with lows of $105 over the past few days, this puts it within 7\~11% of this (granted, assumed) 12% LTV ratio threshold for Mr. Musk. TSLA is, arguably, rather sensitive to shorts at this point in time, albeit recognizing that 7\~11% of its share price represents $24B\~$36B market cap.",Mr. Musk's Debt Obligations,1,self.wallstreetbets,104h1ta,_TechnocratiK_,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/104h1ta/mr_musks_debt_obligations/,1672969288,1835,27,4,289,0.028,0.939,0.032,0.0534,0.455,0.545,0.0,-0.3612

"**Recap On Tuesdays Market Action:*** SPY closed down 1.14%* QQQ closed down 1.57%* Dow Jones Industrial closed down 1.02%* VIX closed up 2.05%Good evening everyone, the major indices all closed down today with the VIX closing slightly higher than yesterday. All eyes will be on the employment numbers coming out at 8:30am tomorrow. This data release is of particular interest because it will give investors an idea of how well the Fed is doing at fighting inflation. Interestingly, if the data release shows strong employment and wage growth, we may see the market indices sell off. But why, employment and wage growth is good right? Not when you’re the Federal Reserve and are looking for signs that inflation is easing. Strong employment data shows companies still have demand for workers and large wage increases can be passed onto consumers in the form of price increases. Now let’s take a look and see what the charts are telling us.https://preview.redd.it/zo2cr6l5rbaa1.png?width=2261&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d6bcb59bcbf50264ca3df2bc5870739453a2706fSPY is still trading sideways and is forming a small triangle. We may see a break of this range tomorrow with the big data release coming. Although SPY closed down it did so on less volume, this may indicate weak selling power or just the usual drop in volume before announcements. However, he picture for upside potential is not very rosy. We are currently below all of the moving averages and very close to the 52 week lows.https://preview.redd.it/6wk5al96rbaa1.png?width=2268&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ace5781c5918cff7f264c2ebe3a8de4656c3252QQQ is looking even worse than SPY, much closer 52 week lows and very far below the moving averages. SPY at least has a somewhat constructive pattern forming but QQQ has really nothing going for it.**Watchlist:**https://preview.redd.it/sugo7707rbaa1.png?width=2264&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd3938e960da552e45df21c2649943583abab904If we see the market rise tomorrow SSO has a good potential entry. SSO is a 2x leveraged ETF that tracks the S&amp;P 500, so for every 1% increase in SPY we would see a 2% increase in SSO. This is a good way to get some market exposure as it allows for some extra leverage. The trigger for this stock would be $45.40 which is right above the recent high. If SSO gaps up above or near the entry it would be best to wait 15 minutes for the market to settle and see where price is at.https://preview.redd.it/rhozw408rbaa1.png?width=2262&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f2a87ca0007b3a04cc2b345aea59c2faeee47257Conversely, if the market begins to drop tomorrow we can watch SDS. SDS is similar to SSO except for every 1% decrease in SPY, SDS increases 2%. We can see better volume here as well as a base forming above all of the moving averages. Again, if there is a gap up, wait for the market to settle and then see where price is at.https://preview.redd.it/zlvhine9rbaa1.png?width=2253&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b5961df245dcc082350fd0e4b88657936d835a58CPRX (Catalyst Pharmaceuticals) is still looking good with an entry price of $19.10. This is a shorter base and is less reliable than a long base breakout. A good sign is that volume increased with price, however on the breakout we would like to see a heavy increase in volume.https://preview.redd.it/xzslhu0arbaa1.png?width=2261&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1e82ffb85ad9cb986dba62b719bc353bfe52dc1cMMP triggered yesterday with a small volume increase. Today price really increased and ran right into the 50 day EMA. This is not on the watchlist as it is too extended from its base.https://preview.redd.it/n5h6zdoarbaa1.png?width=2266&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e36f4e64d0d6b33ce3ac695ba4e6425aeeedd7e4PSX (Phillips 66) is an energy stock that how a nice move up today and is close to a base breakout price of $104.80. Energy stocks have been very strong this year and may rally again.https://preview.redd.it/igho3z5brbaa1.png?width=2264&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e06c365be0a0eda57f5e6f634e273d5c653ff087Lastly, we have DCP (DCP Midstream) another energy stock. This stock is of particular interest because we can see large spikes of buying volume and very little selling. The sales and EPS are great and there are also 8.0 days of short interest. Considering how close this stock is to recent highs, these shorts may have to cover if price moves up to much.With all of these stocks be sure to do your own research before if you decided to open a position. Also this is not the time in the market to have large exposure, be very careful with your buying and be ready to close positions quickly.**Bringing everything together:**While many market indices are weak at the moment, there are pockets of potential that may be pushed to breakout depending on tomorrows news. SPY should be the favorite over QQQ as it is much stronger at the moment. There are also several individual stocks, mainly biotech and energy, that are nearing base breakouts. Regardless of what index or stock you buy caution needs to be priority number one. This market can whip back and forth very fast and it is not good mentally or financially to go along for the ride.Please comment below what stocks you are looking at and why in addition to your thoughts or comments on my watchlist.",Stocks To Watch for 01/06/2023,1,self.wallstreetbets,104gl2h,everyday_trades,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/104gl2h/stocks_to_watch_for_01062023/,1672968064,5304,30,5,770,0.027,0.825,0.148,0.9986,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

"So, a school friend of mine once told me about a casino roulette strategy. Let's say it's the classic red and black roulette with a 50% probability to get one of the two.  He says, what stops someone to bet increasing sums to cover the previous losses until he's going to be profitable? Let's say he bets $1. If he wins, cool he takes my dollar. But if he loses and then he loses that dollar. Then he would bet $2, so now he's at -$3, so he just bet $3, and so on.

"Hey everyone on r/wsb,It's your favorite billionaire playboy here, Bruce Wayne. I just wanted to share my thoughts on the recent market action.As we all know, the stock market can be a wild ride. One minute you're up, the next you're down. But that's what makes it so exciting, right? It's like a rollercoaster of emotions.I've been keeping a close eye on the market lately and have noticed a few trends that I think are worth mentioning. Firstly, it seems like tech stocks are on the rise. I've been seeing a lot of activity in companies like Tesla and Apple, and I have a feeling they'll continue to do well.On the other hand, I've also noticed a bit of a dip in the retail sector. Companies like GameStop and AMC have been struggling lately, and I'm not sure if they'll bounce back anytime soon.Overall, I think it's important to stay diversified and not put all your eggs in one basket.

"TLDR: Buying calls and shares here and keep expanding  if we drop some more &amp;#x200B;This is all fugazi and former hyperbulls and degenerate gamblers are talking nonstop about how TSLA could drop to 0 and still is highly overvalued, AMZN is done and AAPL and the others are overinvested and inflated shit stocks. Insane recession will kill us all. You see the issue? Yep, those are the ones that kept longing in 22 and hold bags from TSLA above 1k, and now they start their doomsday crash talks. Most of the mentioned stocks and their peers are at their lows, lows that have not been seen in a while, I don´t care if it has a PE of 80 or 100, if you wanna make sense of valuation and what´s worth what you are wrong here. It´s not as simple as that, and it also won´t work on those stocks. However, we are seeing these lows and we see the crowd getting really regarded, pretty much the opposite of what we see at the highs. Now I don´t think everything will bottom and fly from here, you would be foolish if you would think anyone can say the bottom is in or not, but I see an asymetric opportunity here. Max amount of bearish regards that were the absolute biggest bulls when it was the worst time to be bullish, furthermore the data that helps the bear case is losing it´s impact on the market, CPI is gonna keep dropping for the near future and the FED can talk but they are not doing anything wild for now.&amp;#x200B;So I think we might chop and even have a bit of a drop still for tomorrow and the next week till CPI on thursday, probably the turn already happens earlier and thursday will give us a major push up. Then it´s only earnings and I think earnings could throw this into the trash and make me regarded or they could absolutely melt us up. &amp;#x200B;Yes the last part is key and we cannot predict it , but I take the bet against the crowd.

"I’ve always been attracted to the idea of crypto and stocks since 2020 and used to think it was a get rich quick sorta thing but i know that’s not impossible, but how unrealistic is it? I’m 18 Years old, Senior in high school graduating in May, been unemployed for a couple of months now and was given 1000$ by my mom with the money she got as compensation for my brother’s death (over 100k).  I wanted to use the money toward dropshipping 2 days in so far and no sales. Very saturated market but thought i’d give it a go. Only spent 100 on it of the 1000 so lost it but at least i learned it’s not really realistic.So i decided today I’d go to r/personalfinance to ask the same thing. I set a goal for New Years of having 50k by 2024. “how can i get there?” Now, me not knowing I was going to get clowned on by middle aged men that get happy over 100 dollar profits in a year,  i posted it. And it ruined all my motivation for it. I want to know, how unrealistic is that from this subreddits POV. I plan on getting a job this summer because I know I can’t and don’t want to stay unemployed forever, that’s being a bum. So for the time being with the 1000 I was given, I just wanted to find ways I can flip that and make more money with it. Now, 50K is a very extreme goal to make in a year, but how hard would it be? From the wallstreetbets side of things. I know this is going to make me sound naïve but at 18 right now, I don’t want to choose the slow, happy at 100$ yearly profit path. I want to be a millionaire by the time I’m 30. Those are goals I’m setting for myself, and I know nothing is impossible. I just wanna be pointed into the direction of how I can get there. My mind has been rotten by the crypto, get rich quick influence and it’ll be hard for me to leave it.

This data with the revision of the revision is very interesting going into tomorrow. &amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/q2e6fqseqaaa1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28d3f9f59af6593a7fff3e84467a92ee1aaa1022Tomorrow is also a huge data day for the markets too. Looking at the trend of UE numbers we have held anywhere from 3.5% to 3.7% UE rate since 4/1/22. We have not seen a reading lower than 3.5 and we have not had one over 3.7% since march. Remember the lower that UE rate is the more bearish that markets will receive that data. The lower the UE rate is the more strong the economy is and the more room the fed may have to go. We are average a +/- 1% open on these UE rate days. I do expect a bigger move at open. With that being factored in we could see an open near 375.6 or we could see an open near 383.2.&amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/k5wa0ybfqaaa1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e56482519255abc9eb7f88cf579c5e0b2dd72fb5I noted something interesting on the daily chart. If we take a look back at November CPI starting the day after CPI we held about a $10 range for the whole month from November 11th to the next CPI on December 12th with the exeception of 5 days total closing outside of that $10 range. Note on November 30th was that JPOW speech where the market randomly rocketed 3.15% on his “bullish” news. It took two days to erase all of those gains… if we eliminate that artificial and rogue pump all but one day from CPI to CPI closed in the same $10 range… Looking at the December CPI till present after the 3 day post CPI drop we have closed all of our daily candles within the same about $10 range… We are in some massive consolidation right now for really the last two months. If we took away 6 of the last 37 days essentially all 31 days have maintained a $10 range from high to low. The next thing I am noting here is that there is a very clear bear flag forming on the daily chart. If we look at this daily bear flag here IF we were to finally breakout of this $10 range we could see our new $10 range form down below. I would target 360 to 370 if that was to happen. I still unless unemployment data tomorrow can finally break us out of this range believe that we are going to see SPY hold this say $10 range with a few outliers until CPI next Thursday. That CPI is either going to put us back in the same 392 to 403 range OR its going to leg us down to the next $10 range down below which I anticipate would be 360 to 370 area as we spent a lot of time in October. We also sent a lot of time int eh 370 to 378 range in June and some in October and November. Focusing back on the daily technical we maintained that red support line with a near perfect support line bounce. However we did close below 379.6 which I would consider one of the more important support lines from the last three weeks of trading. I mentioned EOD yesterday I was bearish and favored overnight puts with the daily 20ema rejection with also a rejection of the upper blue consolidation channel. Today we closed under the daily 8ema completely. With a rejection of the daily 20ema for two days in a row and now closing back under the daily 8ema I favor bearish but still recognize the incredible strength of this blue consolidation channel. Key support- 379.3 -&gt; 379 -&gt; 376.6 -&gt; 374.1Key resistance- 380.7 -&gt; 381.8 -&gt; 383.1&amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/k97ov3vfqaaa1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9b52f5d8e7765a9cc6838ccc453c04c0c950c09Taking a look at futures here you can see the same upper consolidation channel from November and now our current blue consolidation channel. I am seeing three rejections in a row of the daily 20ema, and a closure below the daily 8ema again. It is not quite a bearish engulfing candle but it is very close. I am bearish for tomorrow. However we did manage to hold that red support line. With a rejection on the upside today at 3872 that should favor more downside. There really is an even tighter consolidation range of 3872 to 3842 that 9 of the last 12 candles have closed within. There has only been one candle closed below 3842 since futes has entered this consolidation period. This should and could be a signal of the bear flags pending break down. Support- 3832 -&gt; 3805 -&gt; 3787Resistance- 3872 -&gt; 3895&amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/eihgmlegqaaa1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5c47ce1995e10b83f63dcf04cdf2cb28e4f19a9Tesla came within 40 cents of putting in back to back inside days. I did expect a continuation day today based on structure. We did see a red day today however it was not quite as bearish as I expected. This 108 to 110 area is putting in some heavy support here on Tesla. We very well COULD be finding support on Tesla here. If you remember 111.5 is support that dates back to August of 2020. This is not too surprising after 3 months of straight dropping on Tesla for it to finally enter some consolidation. Looking at the daily unless it opens under 107.97 (-2.2%) we are actually going to break that red falling wedge resistance. Going into next weekend if we did break that resistance on the daily that could provide some upside relief. With this 108 to 110 area proving to be strong support I would eye a push back up to 120-130 next week IF we get a break of resistance. However if we did maintain that resistance I would still eye 94.5 support area. &amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/50462skhqaaa1.png?width=626&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce0252af6cccc38088cd3e88c4894550f98f0a94Not a whole lot going on with the VIX currently we did break that diamond support I mentioned and we are now facing another breakout triangle on the daily chart here. We are holding the daily 8 and 20ema as support. This actually could be the first time the daily 8 and 20ema crossover bullishly (bearish for stocks… bullish for VIX) since October 24th. This movement on the VIX is actually giving me more information to support the bear flag breaking and we see a sell off going into CPI. If we lose this consolidation pattern on SPY before CPI happens we could end up seeing a leg down before CPI. CPI could end up being the bullish move back up to prevent the next major sell off assuming the data comes in as bullish as it looks now. With this trend we very well could see a repeat of November where we were holding in the 380s going into CPI and saw a bigger sell off leading into CPI that put us down at 370 support. **Daily log-**https://preview.redd.it/z120pz7iqaaa1.png?width=802&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=19aab38481cc36a8d0092d7e2a13b10befd9e524I am finding myself having to become increasingly patient in this market and I also find myself struggling to take high probability setups due to rogue movements we have seen. The only L2L play that stopped out today for me was the 10am setup that looked like the perfect setup for puts however we ended up with a massive $2 pump out of nowhere only to give it all back up the very next candle. Scalps were pretty great today but I ended up getting greedy on a possible EOD breakdown trying to test my technical to play out and for spy to continue only to see 7% gains immediately go to my stop loss.

"Alright folks, its been awhile but here's some fresh DD for you all. There's some major money sitting right under your noses and y'all have no idea. #The PlaysEnter $ARCK and $RNER. Two SPACs who carry floats of **61K and 54K** respectively.Yes you read that correctly. **61,000 shares and 54,000** shares. This is **verified** through the following SEC Filings:[$ARCK 8K outlining redemption](https://app.quotemedia.com/data/downloadFiling?webmasterId=90423&amp;ref=117109637&amp;type=PDF&amp;symbol=ARCK&amp;companyName=Arbor+Rapha+Capital+Bioholdings+Corp.+I&amp;formType=8-K&amp;formDescription=Current+report+pursuant+to+Section+13+or+15%28d%29&amp;dateFiled=2022-12-09&amp;CK=1855886)[$RNER 8K outlining redemption](https://app.quotemedia.com/data/downloadFiling?webmasterId=90423&amp;ref=117152001&amp;type=PDF&amp;symbol=RNER&amp;companyName=Mount+Rainier+Acquisition+Corp.&amp;formType=8-K&amp;formDescription=Current+report+pursuant+to+Section+13+or+15%28d%29&amp;dateFiled=2023-01-04&amp;CK=1854461)#But how does the math breakdown NewDM?Thanks for asking! Here's how we get the share count with both stocks:$ARCK can be derived from this line in the 8K filing: *Item 8.01 Other Events.Stockholders elected to redeem an aggregate of 17,188,668 shares of Class A Common Stock, representing approximately 99.6% of the issued and outstanding Class A Common Stock*We simply take the 17,250,000 common shares available for redemption from the [10Q filing](https://app.quotemedia.com/data/downloadFiling?webmasterId=90423&amp;ref=116881896&amp;type=PDF&amp;symbol=ARCK&amp;companyName=Arbor+Rapha+Capital+Bioholdings+Corp.+I&amp;formType=10-Q&amp;formDescription=General+form+for+quarterly+reports+under+Section+13+or+15%28d%29&amp;dateFiled=2022-08-11&amp;CK=1855886) and subtract the 17,188,668 shares from it, giving us a grand total of **61,332 shares**.Next, is $RNER, derived from this line in the 8K: *Item 8.01. Other Events.**In connection with the stockholders’ vote at the Special Meeting, the Company’s public stockholders had the right to elect to redeem all or a portion of their shares of common stock for a per share price calculated in accordance with the Company’s organizational documents. The Company’s public stockholders holding **2,660,436 shares** of common stock validly elected to redeem their public shares in connection with the approval of the Business Combination.**These redemptions were in addition to the **14,535,798 shares** of common stock that were tendered for redemption in connection with the special meeting of the Company’s stockholders held on December 21, 2022.*Now, this one took me a minute but I did the math so you don't have to. Their [10Q filing](https://app.quotemedia.com/data/downloadFiling?webmasterId=90423&amp;ref=117037238&amp;type=PDF&amp;symbol=RNER&amp;companyName=Mount+Rainier+Acquisition+Corp.&amp;formType=10-Q&amp;formDescription=General+form+for+quarterly+reports+under+Section+13+or+15%28d%29&amp;dateFiled=2022-11-04&amp;CK=1854461) also outlines 17,250,000 shares. The math goes as follows:14,535,798 shares redeemed prior plus 2,660,436 shares gets us **17,196,234 shares**. 17,250,000 minus 17,196,234 equals **53,766 shares left in the float.**Do you have any idea how rare this opportunity is? When was the last time you saw a stock with less than 1M shares? What about less than 500K? Less than 250K??#How do I play this and not get burned?Now this is the trick. **What follows is not financial advice. You are not obligated to act based on what I am about to write. I am purely writing up how I plan to play these. I am not responsible for your investments nor your investment choices.**I have accumulated both of these in the $11-$13 range. SPACs typically hover around $10 until they de-spac and go public. Then the market does what they please with them. These plays are completely under the radar at this point. I would venture to guess less than 50-100 folks know. **You are early if you buy now.**I've learned not to be a pig and hold profits for the de-ramp. If you want to see how these can go, check out $RACY. It had a 153K float and ran yesterday. $12 to $44 from open to end AH. I played it from $14.95 to $28 for a nice 65ish% gain. Folks likely made more than me.I plan to hold 90% of my position for 50-100% and then let the rest ride. These floats are unprecedented so who knows what could happen.#ConclusionYou. Are. Not. Obligated. To. Act. On. This. Info.Seriously. I am passing this along because it has potential to rocket once it gets eyes. I think $RACY got derailed by the Chinese pumps today (see $HKD). But once it cools down, folks will be looking for plays. I know exactly where I'm betting the shed.","You degens want a low float play? Ever invested in a stock that has 61,000 shares?

"https://youtu.be/F5a9aASy--cFrom the announcement:&gt; Palantir Skykit brings intelligence and operations to the edge. It is a fully disconnected intelligence center giving soldiers an advantage over adversaries. Skykit is powered by Palantir software including Meta-Constellation and AIP, allowing users to task and analyze data from anywhere.There’s limited news out at the moment, but my understanding is this will be an “intelligence center in a box” which soldiers can use in the field to make better decisions. Each unit comes equipped with built in laptops, monitors, drones, battery power supply, and a satellite link to access continuous feed from all overhead satellite images of the area. All running on Palantir software which analyzes that collected data to flag potential threats and points of interest. Thoughts? The DoD has the fattest piggy bank of any organization or company on earth. Palantir already being ingrained as their core software provider and now moving to also provide hardware seems like a guarantee of increased “safe” revenue as well as much better opportunities to be selected for future contracts. This is a stock that burned a lot of people over the past 2 years but they’ve been making a lot of good moves lately and are expected to turn profitable in 2023.

"Hey WallStreetBets,It looks like Amazon is preparing for some tough times ahead, with the company taking out an $8 billion unsecured loan and reportedly planning for workforce reductions. While some may see this as a sign of trouble, I see it as a buying opportunity.Yes, Amazon's stock dropped 50% last year and the macroeconomic environment is uncertain. But with peak inflation hopefully behind us and a consumer base that is still in good shape, I believe there's potential for an upside surprise in the near future. And who better to lead the company through these challenges than Jeff Bezos himself? It's been less than two years since he stepped down as CEO, and if Bob Iger can make a successful return to Disney, why not Bezos at Amazon?Don't let the short-term challenges discourage you.

Xadago, its marketed drug for Parkinson’s disease, and its key driver, evenamide for schizophrenia, are virtually free. Further clinical progress of evenamide in schizophrenia and starting the PD-LID label extension trial for Xadago should add significantly to the value while reducing the clinical development risk. Moreover, the exciting “Studies 014/015” interim data might trigger a potential global partnering deal with a major CNS player earlier than expected, providing further equity upside.Key catalysts include:1. Full results “Study 014” trial of evenamide in TRS (March 2023)2. Start new label trial Xadago in PD-LID (H1 2023)3.

"Hey WallStreetBets Community,I know this is going to be a controversial opinion, but hear me out. I think that the current obsession with short-term gains is doing more harm than good for the stock market.I understand that the allure of quick profits is tempting, but constantly buying and selling stocks based on short-term trends is ultimately destabilizing for the market. It creates unnecessary volatility and can even lead to market crashes.Instead, I think it would be more beneficial for investors to focus on long-term growth. This means taking the time to research and carefully select stocks that have the potential for sustainable growth over a period of years, rather than just looking for a quick buck.I know this kind of thinking goes against the grain of WallStreetBets, but I think it's important to consider the long-term effects of our actions on the market (example Warren Buffet). What do you guys think? Am I off base, or do you agree that a focus on long-term growth is a better approach for the stock market?",Making a Stronger Impact,1,self.wallstreetbets,1043v8w,PolymathPundit,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1043v8w/making_a_stronger_impact/,1672937797,1031,24,4,173,0.049,0.751,0.2,0.9835,0.0,0.435,0.565,0.3818

"Hi everyone,I know this is going to be a controversial opinion, but I think we need to start considering the long-term implications of our investments on the overall economy. I know we all want to make as much money as possible, but I think we need to start considering the ethical implications of our actions.For example, investing in companies that have a history of exploiting their workers or engaging in unethical business practices might make us a quick buck, but it ultimately hurts society as a whole. It's short-sighted to only focus on our own profits at the expense of the well-being of others.I'm not saying we should completely avoid these types of investments, but I think we should at least consider the bigger picture and try to make a positive impact with our investments. It might mean taking a slightly lower return in the short-term, but I believe it's the responsible thing to do.What do you guys think? Am I being too idealistic or do you agree with me?

"Due to its CEO who is following a personal agenda.

A carefully planned orchestrated move by Sundadarajan Pichai.Google buys stocks back and Sundar takes 242,000,000 every year worth from these treasury stocks. This makes the Google stock buybacks worthless.All management is taking treasury stocks in the form of compensation (bonuses). In short, all Google managers are diluting the company and existing Google stockholders are fucked.Google is doomed. The only way Google can bounce up is to stop compensation in the form of Google stocks and just pay Google employees a salary, starting with the CEO Sundararajan. Google needs to continue making stockbuybacks and it must stop its CEO from taking more Google treasury stocks.This will be the end of Google is Sundar doesn't stop.Google doesn't even pay dividends. Stockholders are double fucked. There is nothing that motivates people to buy Google stock.The greatest scam is taking place.

" Silvergate bank?Silvergate Bank is a financial institution that primarily serves cryptocurrency companies. It provides cryptocurrency exchanges and investors with bank accounts and operates a network that connects these investors to exchanges. The bank is well-known for having a high percentage of cryptocurrency-related deposits, which account for roughly 90% of total deposits.. Silvergate Bank has contributed significantly to the growth of the cryptocurrency industry by providing a dependable banking solution for companies in the space.# What is going on?As the crypto market continues to face challenges, Silvergate Bank has found itself at the center of the storm. The collapse of FTX triggered a rush of withdrawals totaling $8.1 billion, leading Silvergate to sell assets at a loss in order to cover these withdrawals. The resulting $718 million loss far exceeds the bank's profits since at least 2013In response to the crisis, Silvergate has made significant changes to its operations. The bank has laid off 40% of its staff, or around 200 employees, and plans to scale back its businesses. It has also abandoned its plans to launch its own digital currency, writing off the $196 million it invested in technology developed by Facebook for its failed crypto-based payments network.As a bank that primarily serves the crypto industry, Silvergate operates a network linking investors to crypto exchanges. FTX and other companies controlled by its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, made up around $1 billion of the bank's deposits. The collapse of these companies in November sent shockwaves through the crypto market, leading to a sharp drop in Silvergate's stock.Despite the steep decline in deposits, Silvergate's unique business model of providing bank accounts to crypto exchanges and investors, as well as its high percentage of crypto-related deposits (90%), allowed it to weather the storm. Additionally, Silvergate remains committed to the crypto industry and has the resources to handle a sustained downturn, with more cash on hand and debt securities that can be quickly sold at the end of Q4. Furthermore, the bank's network saw an increase in daily average volume during this time.In the past three months, Silvergate's stock has dropped more than 70% and is heavily shorted. While the trade has been profitable for shorts, with profits of over $400 million in the past year, the stock saw a rally of 27% on Wednesday, its best percentage gain since 2020.#  How can this affect my crypto assets?Silvergate is a major player in the industry and its failure could cause a ripple effect among other companies in the crypto space.If Silvergate were to go bankrupt, it could potentially disrupt the operations of the companies it serves and lead to a loss of confidence in the cryptocurrency market more broadly. It could also lead to financial losses for companies that rely on Silvergate's services and potentially create uncertainty among investors.[Orignal Article](https://vallo.substack.com/p/is-crypto-bank-silvergate-struggling/comments) \- add charts and pictures, but the bot countered me anyway, trying now via link&amp;#x200B;================================================================================The moral of the story is :If you think that the current state of the cryptocurrency market represents a good opportunity for investment and you have confidence in the future potential of cryptocurrencies, then investing in Silvergate could be a smart move.In fact, if the market reaches a market cap of $10T in the coming years, it could potentially lead to crazy returns of 500K USD/BTC, given its current price of around $17,000.However, if you are concerned about the economy or believe that the price of bitcoin will decline below $16,000, it may be best to stay away from the crypto market.It is important to be careful with the amount you invest and to be aware that the value of your investments could temporarily go down, but in the long run (2024-2027), the cryptocurrency market has the potential to generate significant returns like no other market out there.

"Ticker: Jeffs' Brands (JFBR)Company Analysis: JFBR is a premium conglomerate of e-commerce consumer goods that primarily operates on the Amazon platform. Its customers are primarily online individual consumers and resellers who source products primarily on the Amazon US and Amazon EU marketplaces. And quickly established a good basic relationship and brand awareness among consumers. JFBR's advantages lie in traffic, users, and advertising. Judging from the data, the correlation between the three is not strong. Because user growth is still the main growth method of JFBR, thanks to their perfect service system and strong strategic goals.The advantages of the Amazon platform where JFBR is located are mainly manifested in several aspects: First, the user base. As a shopping platform, Amazon's users account for a large proportion of the total population. In the United States, almost one out of every three people uses Amazon's services. With this user base, Amazon pays a lot of attention to products. The second is the huge scale and efficient distribution system. JFBR has now taken the lead in the EU market and continues to grow. In terms of shareholding, institutions are also more optimistic about JFBR's future development prospects. Since the Q3 quarter, the number of shares held has been increased, and the stock price is expected to usher in a turnaround after more than a month of precipitation.Although the timing is missed in the morning, but in the plate is expected to have a sharp rise in, suitable for short term investment, about 15% to 25% left to have the rise",今日观点 JFBR,1,self.wallstreetbets,1042fjt,Nelia0520,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1042fjt/今日观点_jfbr/,1672934247,1589,9,2,256,0.02,0.854,0.126,0.9427,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

In last FLJ's prospectus, as stated in F-3 SEC filling report: “On October 26, 2021, we transferred all of our equity interest in the WFoE, to Wangxiancai Limited, which is beneficially owned by the legal representative and executive director of one of our subsidiaries, a related party (the Equity Transfer). The WFoE has a series of contractual arrangements with the ViE. Through the ViE entities, we carried out certain rental apartment operation business prior to the Equity Transfer.” “As of the date hereof, **we have initiated bankruptcy proceedings with respect to major VIE entities**.”[  P1 F-3 Description](https://preview.redd.it/60ch1mknx8aa1.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3bac9082929b0366984cad9c848d09a63c93b3d9)[  P2 6-K Financial statement](https://preview.redd.it/wg3o4aeqx8aa1.jpg?width=1100&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a69c233c9b1e7314561d88a74f5a57dc3348a512)During its latest SEC 6-K filling, the ViE entities contributed only 0.4% of FLJ consolidated revenues for the six months ended March 31, 2022. But carry over 54% liabilities which worth over ￥1,552,194,000. Therefore, since its keep transferring its debts to WFoE, I think FLJ's liabilities will be significantly reduced, and the revenue will not be affected at all.  * **$FLJ assets will increase over 232%, debts will decrease over 98%, shareholders’ deficit will GONE, in its next earning report!**As FLJ will keep divesting non-performing assets, I estimate the next financial report for FLJ will make huge changes. As discussed, since FLJ will divest most of its liabilities while retaining as much of its main business as possible, the following tables shows what will likely to happen: [  P3 Estimate financial statement ](https://preview.redd.it/ojk6ky6xx8aa1.jpg?width=1100&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f027c2c47e9b612baa57e742fb8e32bd7569e1fd)Since deposit are normally one month rent from tenants. Therefore, rents receivable from April 1 to September 30 is ￥56,170,000 \* 6=￥337,020,000. Which lead the total  assets increase to ￥482,214,000, as they keep divested the financial liabilities, it will likely to decrease its liabilities to ￥56,170,000. That’s 232% increase in total assets, over 98% decrease in liabilities! Which is huge financial condition change for a company like this! Therefore, the next earning will cause stock price to go up significantly!* **Based on the technical analysis, you can expect a 1000% increase in stock price!**https://preview.redd.it/oiu0wnj1y8aa1.png?width=1758&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe6d2ae052d634d3a162d217bd5ff1540f463bc3https://preview.redd.it/cv0tq9h2y8aa1.png?width=1761&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=02aeb0baf2f1c58566992ce835fece9ae4bef197From technical side of analysis, I noticed there have been several days of unusual volume.

Fundamental analysis looks to see whether an investment is overvalued or undervalued based on underlying economic conditions, as well as the finances of the company or other organization that issued a stock or bond. Technical analysis instead looks at patterns in the price of an investment to predict future movements in that investment’s price.I look for tickers that are trading at least 2 million in volume a day, with a market-cap of no less than 500 million.The shares traded are compared to the average volume to determine how much of the float is used (Or shares traded). That information is compiled with data on how profitable the company is and how much cash do they have compared to what is expected.||Things to consider when finding the plays-· If the stock volume has traded 1 million or more in volume premarket, I will use that and calculate a rough estimate on what the stock will trade for the day.· If the ticker looks to be trading more volume than the day before, I will consider it for a long play. If trading less than the movement of the ticker, I would consider a short or put play. (If all the other factors previously mentioned checks out.)· The trades are researched afternoon daily to find possible tickers making a big move. Some of the prices may be less depending on day and time trade is executed.|||||",Thursday Tickers Tl:DR,1,self.wallstreetbets,103ywt7,Badboyardie,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/103ywt7/thursday_tickers_tldr/,1672925183,1690,22,3,279,0.008,0.923,0.069,0.9349,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

At the close, the Dow rose 0.4%, the Nasdaq was up 0.69%, and the S&amp;P 500 was up 0.74%..The 10-year US Treasury yield dropped 1.628% to 3.687%, compared with a yield spread of -67 bps over the two-year note while VIX was down 3.89%. Brent crude closed down 5.26%. Spot gold closed up 0.84% at $1,855.15 an ounce.

Second, no one on the FOMC is considering cutting rates in 2023; Finally, the fear that markets are too optimistic and that if they underestimate the Fed's determination to keep rates high through 2023, financial conditions loosen uncomfortably, reducing the Fed's effectiveness in controlling inflation.**Trending Stocks**[**Microsoft (MSFT)**](http://www.testainvest.com/stocks/NASDAQ-MSFT/)Microsoft dropped 4.37% after UBS analyst downgraded the stock to hold.

"Amazon.com Inc. is laying off more than 18,000 employees — the biggest reduction in its history — in the latest sign that a tech-industry slump is deepening.Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy announced the cuts, which represent about 1% of Amazon’s employees, in a memo to staff Wednesday, saying it followed the company’s annual planning process.The eliminations began last year and were previously expected to affect about 10,000 people. The move is concentrated in the firm’s corporate ranks, mostly Amazon’s retail division and human resources functions, like recruiting.“Amazon has weathered uncertain and difficult economies in the past, and we will continue to do so,” Jassy said. “These changes will help us pursue our long-term opportunities with a stronger cost structure.”Though the prospect of layoffs has loomed over Amazon for months — the company has acknowledged that it hired too many people during the pandemic — the increasing total suggests the company’s outlook has darkened. It joins other tech giants in making major cuts. Earlier Wednesday, Salesforce Inc. announced plans to eliminate about 10% of its workforce and reduce its real estate holdings.Full article: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-05/amazon-to-slash-more-than-18-000-jobs-in-escalation-of-cutbacks](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-05/amazon-to-slash-more-than-18-000-jobs-in-escalation-of-cutbacks)Amazon (AMZN) is currently up 2% despite its announcement of laying-off more than 18,000 employees, the biggest cut in its history.

Fundamental analysis looks to see whether an investment is overvalued or undervalued based on underlying economic conditions, as well as the finances of the company or other organization that issued a stock or bond. Technical analysis instead looks at patterns in the price of an investment to predict future movements in that investment’s price.I look for tickers that are trading at least 2 million in volume a day, with a market-cap of no less than 500 million.The shares traded are compared to the average volume to determine how much of the float is used (Or shares traded). That information is compiled with data on how profitable the company is and how much cash do they have compared to what is expected.||Things to consider when finding the plays-· If the stock volume has traded 1 million or more in volume premarket, I will use that and calculate a rough estimate on what the stock will trade for the day.· If the ticker looks to be trading more volume than the day before, I will consider it for a long play. If trading less than the movement of the ticker, I would consider a short or put play. (If all the other factors previously mentioned checks out.)· The trades are researched afternoon daily to find possible tickers making a big move. Some of the prices may be less depending on day and time trade is executed.|||||",Moving tickers of interest,1,self.wallstreetbets,103y6ir,Badboyardie,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/103y6ir/moving_tickers_of_interest/,1672923040,1679,26,4,279,0.008,0.923,0.069,0.9349,0.0,0.5,0.5,0.4588

"So, if you don't know, a new president has been elected in Brazil, who is a socialist based president and plans to take $PBR, or Petrobas, into an age of government control over parts of the Brazilian economy. The stock plummeted by over 10% when this news came out.[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-criticism-lulas-economic-plans-151648109.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-criticism-lulas-economic-plans-151648109.html)Lula's policy is a worker's policy. So, from what I know, Petrobas is going to lose a lot of value in the coming years until they can regain control over their company, which requires a different president or for the current one to change policy, which wont' happen. I'm concerned about other investments having similar issues, like Vale mining.My average cost in Vale is close to 18 per share. It's starting to drop, which is fine in normal conditions, but this might be a bad sign, or a good sign to buy more when the stock goes down enough. Like around $12 or $10. I'm just wondering what more educated people on here would do based on past experiences. Is this the kind of political situation where it's not going to affect all Brazil's stocks, only the ones where the president takes over the company's prices/operations, or will this be a new turn in their economy and I should get the hell out?I just never dealt with South America until I bought this stock so I have no clue what it's like down there.My position: https://preview.redd.it/jf0syy0vm4aa1.png?width=1344&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=afd85687363a2f32e5e107da104f9468070a2fceMods: Do not delete my post.

"Hey guys, &amp;#x200B;Today, we will be discussing the ""Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee December 13-14, 2022.""**Quick Summary for Those in a Hurry**The main takeaway is that the FOMC is taking actions to maintain stability in financial markets and support economic growth by keeping the federal funds rate within a certain range and managing the supply of reserves in the banking system. The FOMC expects economic activity to expand at a pace below its trend growth rate in 2023, and notes that recent economic indicators showed modest growth in spending and production, but strong job gains and low unemployment. However, the FOMC also notes that inflation remains elevated due to various factors and is above the Committee's goal of 2%. There is considerable uncertainty around the consumer spending outlook, and the FOMC expects housing activity to remain weak. Investment spending has appeared modest and is being restrained by high borrowing costs and slow growth in final demand. The FOMC also discusses a number of other issues, including international economic developments, the energy and agricultural sectors, and the labor market.Overall, the FOMC's outlook for the economy is mixed. While there have been some positive developments, such as strong job gains and low unemployment, there are also ongoing concerns about inflation, slow growth, and imbalances in the labor market.&amp;#x200B;**Committee Policy Action**The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has directed the Desk to take certain actions starting on December 15, 2022 in order to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4¼ to 4½ percent. These actions include conducting open market operations as needed, conducting overnight repurchase agreements with a minimum bid rate of 4.5 percent and an aggregate operation limit of $500 billion, conducting overnight reverse repurchase agreements at an offering rate of 4.3 percent with a per-counterparty limit of $160 billion per day, rolling over principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of Treasury securities at a monthly cap of $60 billion, reinvesting principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) at a monthly cap of $35 billion, and engaging in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions to facilitate the settlement of agency MBS transactions.The stated amounts for reinvestments may be allowed to deviate modestly if necessary for operational reasons.&amp;#x200B;**FOMC OUTLOOK**&amp;#x200B;FOMC noted that recent economic indicators showed modest growth in spending and production, but strong job gains and low unemployment. This is generally seen as a positive development, as a healthy labor market is crucial for overall economic health.However, the FOMC also noted that inflation remained elevated due to a variety of factors, including supply and demand imbalances, higher food and energy prices, and broader price pressures. This is a concern because high inflation can erode purchasing power and make it more difficult for households and businesses to plan for the future.Looking ahead, the FOMC expects economic activity to expand at a pace below its trend growth rate in 2023. This suggests that the economy may not be as strong as it has been in recent years, but it is also seen as a positive sign that the FOMC expects growth to return over time.In terms of consumer spending, the FOMC reported that it has shown stronger growth in recent months, likely supported by a strong labor market and households running down excess savings. However, there is considerable uncertainty around the consumer spending outlook, and the FOMC expects housing activity to remain weak.In terms of investment spending, the FOMC noted that it has appeared modest and is being restrained by high borrowing costs and an outlook for the slow growth of final demand. This is a concern because investment is an important driver of long-term economic growth.The FOMC also discussed a number of other issues, including international economic developments, the energy and agricultural sectors, and the labor market. In particular, the FOMC noted that the labor market has remained very tight, with an unemployment rate near a historically low level, robust payroll gains, and a high level of job vacancies. However, there are also signs that labor market imbalances may be improving, including declines in job openings and quits and reports of more qualified job applicants for open positions.Despite these positive developments, the FOMC noted that there is still a large imbalance between labor supply and demand, as indicated by the still-large number of job openings and elevated nominal wage growth. This suggests that the labor market may not be as strong as it appears on the surface.In terms of inflation, the FOMC noted that it is unacceptably high, at above the Committee's goal of 2%. While there have been welcome reductions in the monthly pace of price increases, the FOMC believes that more evidence is needed to be confident that inflation is on a sustained downward path. Some measures show that firms' markups are still elevated, and a continued subdued expansion in aggregate demand may be needed to reduce the remaining upward pressure on inflation. The FOMC believes that the appropriate stance of monetary policy is accommodative in order to support the recovery and return inflation to its goal over time…..Overall, the FOMC's outlook for the economy is mixed. While there have been some positive developments, such as strong job gains and low unemployment, there are also ongoing concerns about inflation, slow growth, and imbalances in the labor market.&amp;#x200B;**Bullish factors to consider may include:**The FOMC is taking action to maintain stability in financial markets and support economic growth.Recent economic indicators showed modest growth in spending and production, as well as strong job gains and low unemployment.The FOMC expects economic activity to expand at a pace below its trend growth rate in 2023, indicating that growth is expected to return over time.Consumer spending has shown stronger growth in recent months, potentially supported by a strong labor market and households running down excess savings.The labor market has remained very tight, with an unemployment rate near a historically low level, robust payroll gains, and a high level of job vacancies. There are also signs that labor market imbalances may be improving.&amp;#x200B;Some potential bearish factors to consider may include:Inflation remains elevated due to various factors and is above the FOMC's goal of 2%.There is considerable uncertainty around the consumer spending outlook and the FOMC expects housing activity to remain weak.Investment spending has been modest and is being restrained by high borrowing costs and slow growth in final demand.There is still a large imbalance between labor supply and demand, as indicated by the still-large number of job openings and elevated nominal wage growth.&amp;#x200B;**Congratulations on sticking around!

 Outlook by FED* FOMC submitted projections for real GDP growth, unemployment rate, and inflation for the next few years* Recent economic indicators showed modest growth in spending and production, but strong job gains and low unemployment* Inflation remained elevated due to supply and demand imbalances, higher food and energy prices, and broader price pressures* Economic activity slowed significantly in 2022 and was expected to expand in 2023 at a pace below its trend growth rate* A sustained period of below-trend real GDP growth was expected to bring supply and demand into balance and reduce inflationary pressures* Consumer spending showed stronger growth in September and October, likely supported by a strong labor market and households running down excess savings* There was considerable uncertainty around the consumer spending outlook, and housing activity was expected to remain weak* Growth in investment spending appeared modest and was being restrained by high borrowing costs and an outlook for slow growth of final demand* International economic developments and monetary policy were also discussed.* FOMC discussed developments in the energy and agricultural sectors* Risks of severe disruption from the European Union's embargo and the Group of Seven's price cap on Russian oil exports have diminished* High costs for inputs such as diesel, feed, and fertilizer are causing challenges for the agricultural sector* The labor market has remained very tight, with:Unemployment rate near a historically low level* Robust payroll gains* High level of job vacancies* Elevated nominal wage growth* There are tentative signs that labor market imbalances are improving, including:* Declines in job openings and quits over the second half of 2022* Reports of more qualified job applicants for open positions* Despite this, there is still a large imbalance between labor supply and demand, as indicated by:* Still-large number of job openings* Elevated nominal wage growth* Labor demand has remained strong despite a slowdown in economic growth* Some business contacts reportedly keen to retain workers even in the face of slowing demand for output due to recent experiences with labor shortages and hiring challenges* Labor supply appears to be constrained by structural factors such as:* Early retirements* Reduced availability or increased cost of childcare* More costly transportation* Reduced immigration* Inflation is unacceptably high, at above the Committee's goal of 2%* There are welcome reductions in the monthly pace of price increases, but more evidence is needed to be confident that inflation is on a sustained downward path* Measures of rent based on new leases are indicating a deceleration in the housing market* The pace of increase for prices of core services excluding shelter is high* Some participants noted that the appreciation of the dollar could be contributing to the recent slowing of inflation* Participants agreed that the appropriate stance of monetary policy is accommodative to support the recovery and return inflation to the Committee's goal over time",Key Takeaways from FOMC Meeting Minutes,1,self.wallstreetbets,103l8ex,SnooRecipes1908,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/103l8ex/key_takeaways_from_fomc_meeting_minutes/,1672881175,13998,39,6,2116,0.063,0.765,0.172,0.9998,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

"Today was FOMC minutes lets take a look at what was reiterated…. Remember none of this is new information all of this is things said at the December FOMC meeting (information below form Zerohedge).* · Fed officials were not pleased by the surge in stocks (easing in financial conditions) ahead of the meeting, warning against an “unwarranted” easing in financial conditions:   *  *""Participants noted that, because monetary policy worked importantly through financial markets,* ***an unwarranted easing in financial conditions, especially if driven by a misperception by the public of the Committee's reaction function, would complicate the Committee's effort*** *to restore price stability.""** · **Slowing rate hikes is not pivoting:**   *  *""Participants reaffirmed their strong commitment to returning inflation to the Committee's 2 percent objective. A number of participants emphasized that it would be important to clearly communicate that a slowing in the pace of rate increases was not an indication of any weakening of the Committee's resolve to achieve its price-stability goal or a judgment that inflation was already on a persistent downward path.""** · **""Few"" signs of a wage-price spiral**   *  *""Participants noted that, in the latest inflation data, the pace of increase for prices of core services excluding shelter—which represents the largest component of core PCE price inflation—was high. They also remarked that this component of inflation has tended to be closely linked to nominal wage growth and therefore would likely remain persistently elevated if the labor market remained very tight. Consequently, while there were few signs of adverse wage-price dynamics at present, they assessed that bringing down this component of inflation to mandate-consistent levels would require some softening in the growth of labor demand to bring the labor market back into better balance.""** · FOMC inflation forecasts:   *  *""****Core goods inflation was anticipated to slow further,*** *housing services inflation was expected to peak in 2023 and then move down, while core non-housing services inflation was forecast to move down as wage growth eased.""** ·  **risks are skewed to the upside for inflation but downside for growth**   *  *""With inflation still elevated, the staff continued to view the* ***risks to the inflation projection as skewed to the upside. ""***   *  *""Moreover, the sluggish growth in real private domestic spending expected over the next year, a subdued global economic outlook, and persistently tight financial conditions were seen as tilting the risks to the downside around the baseline projection for real economic activity, and the staff still* ***viewed the possibility of a recession sometime over the next year as a plausible alternative to the baseline""**** · QT:   *  *""Staff indicated that they would* ***continue to monitor money market conditions closely as balance sheet reduction proceeds.""***&amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/nzjjee91y3aa1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ac51583cff065d7f4f57f3187e390bf27cf5cce* · Bloomberg Economics' Anna Wong summarized as follows:   *  “**Minutes reveal that Fed staff are cautious about interpreting recent data as showing a definitive decline in inflation.** For example, they note that the falling inflation compensation implied by TIPS is due to a decline in risk premiums rather than inflation expectations.   *  “Staff point to job-openings data moving down in October. However, **JOLTS data for November (released today) showed an upward revision to October’s job openings,** and the vacancy-to-unemployed ratio actually edged back up in November.   *  “Staff sound **more alarmed about nominal wage growth than in previous FOMC minutes,** hinting that the underlying pace might be running at 5%.”So fed still is scared inflation hasn’t peaked… and they are worried about the strength of the economy. &amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/4amnv4g2y3aa1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10779a1973f81a4c1d7377f8efd2bdd1270c959aWhen we take a look at the daily here you can see we are still in this blue consolidation channel and are still also in a red breakout/down triangle. Today we closed back over 383 for only the second time since December 21st. However, we did reject at the daily 20ema yet again. The daily 20ema has historically been an area of key rejection and until we can truly break through that which also would be a break through of this blue consolidation channel its hard to feel bullish. Realistically we remain stuck in this 376.6 to 386.3 channel until further notice. With the structure of this triangle and blue channel we actually could find ourselves trading here until CPI on January 12th (next Thursday). Key support- 383.1 -&gt; 380.8 -&gt; 379.6 -&gt; 378.1Key resistance- 384.3 -&gt; 386.4 -&gt; 388&amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/ltyioyw2y3aa1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4650f56e907697a0a5b6c569aca74c54a7e45289Tomorrow brings yet again some more economic data and much like this mornings I do not think it will be received very well. &amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/uetheyb3y3aa1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4a8c90fd63fa3e9e54da02e568a99b68a8776cb3Futures has such a nice consolidation channel going with such perfectly held levels its hard not to admire it. Today we came down and confirmed 3842 as support. However in the same motion we also rejected at 3875. With that daily 20ema rejection and a long wick off that rejection we should favor a slight bearish movement going forward. However, we continue to hold support extremely well. Much like SPY until we see this blue consolidation channel hard break we are just stuck in this range. Key support- 3875 -&gt; 3842 -&gt; 3805Key resistance- 3895 -&gt; 3910 -&gt; 3920&amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/3azee4v3y3aa1.png?width=463&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f0084299ff699b05f09fb0311550e9ab18a45c2The Tesla trend of huge red day = green open continues to pay out Swung a nice call this morning for a modest profit. &amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/oty4ix94y3aa1.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a50412c6a85895ed6a3ecac0c1a3e644e645c2bbWe are now at day two of our sell off and still have about 8-9% more to go minimally. &amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/cea69dp4y3aa1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b4744dfa304cd689e0d2dea4adc2eff933facc8Taking a look at the daily chart here you can see that we ended up established 109 as a very nice support area and actually formed a pretty nice double double bottom here. This pattern actually should provide a bigger upside push. This inside day that we had today though should provide a continuation pattern downward though despite the bullish appearing double double bottom holding 109 support. We are coming in very close to that red falling wedge resistance line though. 112.4 remains resistance to hold the red falling wedge integrity. 100.5 is the support of that darker red support line which is the 2022/23 bear channel the tesla has been trading in. If we were to lose that support that would really open a bigger down side and be quite the blow to the technical. &amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/o8mr87u5y3aa1.png?width=622&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=904a5f22014c47bc153d9a38eeb64b086e60c170As I was expecting we ended up getting that morning doji star pattern playing out today on the VIX. I was suspecting to see some upward movement on the VIX today and with the FOMC minutes out and really nothing too major to move the VIX until next weeks CPI we should see the VIX start to unwind slightly into the end of this week. However, as we go into CPI week next week we actually could see in the 2-3 days leading into CPI the VIX start a move up again. However with the support dating back to December 22nd breaking today and closing under 20ema but at the 8ema this should be a bullish favortism for the markets the rest of the week. However, if market digests the next two mornings of heavy data badly or bearishly we could see SPY drop despite this set up. **Daily log-**&amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/drbxske6y3aa1.png?width=708&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bdd81db8e04273f54ab9df618a482085f6582f49Took a small red day today. Tough day to trade with the extreme choppy morning followed by an impressive sell off that immediately led into a pump before minutes. Historically we have seen a nice pump on minutes despite them being bearish, however, they were not received very well today. For me playing a high probability play and losing doesn’t bother me much. It’s the same with a high probability set up based on my trading rules/ technical. Not every trade will be green and not ever trade is going to be that big winner. But in trading we take the highest probability trades. Sometimes we win sometimes we lose. Today we lost. Tomorrow we will look to make that loss up small gain by small gain.",1-4-23 SPY/ ES Futures and Tesla Daily Market Analysis (and FOMC minute review),1,self.wallstreetbets,103i48b,DaddyDersch,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/103i48b/1423_spy_es_futures_and_tesla_daily_market/,1672873470,8994,79,13,1318,0.077,0.801,0.122,0.9968,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

That's the main reason I  never switched but I'm thinking now maybe I can manage with one route.. but not sure if they have proper hotkeys or data or decent software or borrows or support staff.I can't have software or bad quotes.. it can't freeze any any point in the day for more then 5 secondsIs there a share limit or any restrictions on shares per order usually? Is there a cap per month? I'm assuming they send their flow to an ATD would they even want my order flow?Can you usually get access to all the books?Do you usually pay for borrows?

"TRADING IN CASH ACCOUNTS - FREE RIDINGDear Trader,""Free riding"" is a term used to describe the practice of buying and selling shares or other securities without actually having the capital to cover the trade. In a cash account, an investor must pay for the purchase of a security (meaning the trade must settle) before selling that security. If an investor buys a security and then sells that same security without paying for that security in full by the settlement date, the investor is considered to be ""free riding."" IBKR has long had surveillance to detect free-riding in cash accounts, but up to now that surveillance has not detected same-day round-trips in options. Effective after the New York close on January 9, 2023, IBKR will begin to apply the free-riding surveillance to all securities types (i.e., Stocks, ETFs, Bonds, Options, Warrants, Mutual Funds, etc.) other than US Treasuries (which are exempt). Free-riding violations will result in an account being placed in a “90-day freeze” – i.e., those accounts will not be able to make purchases except with settled cash in their account for 90-days",Does this mean we can only sell after 48 hours (settlement),1,self.wallstreetbets,103f5r8,mo2cii,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/103f5r8/does_this_mean_we_can_only_sell_after_48_hours/,1672866640,1112,59,11,183,0.03,0.837,0.133,0.9309,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

"&amp;#x200B;&gt;This is not a post about positive nor negative price predictions. Especially with the reverse split + APE dilution \[to pay off debt so could be bad for price but could be long term good, **I dont know**\]. I cant make a prediction here one way or the other. I just wanted to point at some information and data about CTB, FTDs, share availability and price.&amp;#x200B;# My look at AMC Cost to borrow:&amp;#x200B;[May 2021-May 2022 borrow fee \[green red candles\]](https://preview.redd.it/1ffdhwve73aa1.png?width=1262&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5997fbf359f495c78fc44cd016cb3f173a9bd396)For a long time we have seen cost to borrow at near or under 2% borrow fee for AMC which is normal in the markets. Usually a 0.3-3% fee is fine. This suggested the demand to short was not high. To me this doesnt make that much sense but I will accept that. No matter what occurred with price, or the scarcity of shares the borrow fee stayed the same. I found that quiet strange. Borrow fee seemed to not matter. Any day you look it was roughly 2%.Now since the 12 month drought in CTB rising we finally saw some movement in CTB.&amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/n0g6yin483aa1.png?width=1256&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd64226aec8570bfc32389ab931ba7b25dd54dd4Now while the stock remains at 100% utilization (according to Ortex) whatever shares did hit the market seemed to finally have some form of reflection of the demand in the borrow fees. Surges in borrow fee from 2% to 20%, 40%, 100%, 140%. Coming down every time and establishing higher lows and eventually meeting higher highs in borrow rates.As of recently, I have noticed the lender spiking the borrow fee and slowly lowering it to find the sweet spot that borrowers of the shares are willing to borrow. Here for instance they lowered it to 81.1% and finally shares were taken and boom a move up to 82%.https://preview.redd.it/xsgmbilk63aa1.png?width=890&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=89e14da5028811b91aaec0954f78362ad94804e8Finally, lets take a look at the CTB chart from the distance but this time lets look at the shares available \[gray\] and price \[yellow\] marked in the blue box.https://preview.redd.it/ns2yyclu83aa1.png?width=1257&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63aa5a0268224ad2056247eee4cda29aded0ec94Massive amount of shares were put to market, consistently at high levels around this time. Price came down as well with seemingly all those shares going ""bye bye"". After those shares went ""bye bye"" utilization seemed to freeze at 100% for Ortex. Well to me that seems like all those shares were borrowed and held. Since they were only paying a 1% fee back then and borrow rates are annual... they would have to pay a higher borrow rate one year later. Well when is the 1 year later mark?&amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/0iz8a01b93aa1.png?width=1256&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ffe9f93911f162be1ba7af4ff203a3c9182d9d81Now the spike in borrow fee makes sense. To me it seems the lenders lured in the borrowers with the low rate and now know that the demand is so high they can jack the prices up and they will continue to borrow.Having said all this, what will happen?Are the borrowers continuing to borrow because they are certain the stock price will continue to go down and the borrow rates are well worth it or are they trapped in a losing position by the lenders?

"To be clear, I am not making any criminal allegations YET, it's just come to my attention that the firm might be outright lying about the sort of growth they expect in the stocks they hold in order to pump up valuations artificially.Cathy Wood **hired** mostly **young** finance professionals, most of which have no direct experience in asset management and some of which have held no other full time job outside ARK Invest. For a time I ascribed many of ARK's faults to inexperience, but note that due to the low bargaining power of most her employees the lion's share of ARK's fat 0.75% expense ratio will being going to her. I cannot stress enough, that most if not all of Cathy's employees are **young enough to be her children**, and I have no idea if she's just an old lady trying to be hip or if she's doing all she can to increase her share of the profits. Their website even has a merch store so maybe a little of both...Profit margins are definitely a motive for some of ARK's actions. ARKX (Space ETF) has in its top 10 holdings PRNT (3d Printing ETF). There's nothing wrong with that as one of the widely anticipated applications of 3d printing is allowing astronauts to custom make any tools they need while in space. However, by **putting** the **one fund into the other fund** that allows ARK Invest to **double dip in** their **fees.**They also are insatiable optimists, apparently. At one point Cathy asserted that breakthroughs in **AI technology** would cause **GDP growth** to reach **30% a year.** She also gave performance **targets** for her fund that would make them **by far** the **highest performing** investment **fund** of all time due to all the allegedly paradigm shifting technology stocks it contained, with second place going to a 3x levered fund that closed long ago She has even gone as far to argue the pre-revenue companies they hold represent ""deep value"" investing. Ordinarily, I ascribe nonsense like this to a poor understanding of science because science is rarely profitable. However, while that appears to be a factor, more recently extremes have made me unsure if they really believe the junk that comes out of their mouths.What convinced me to join Michael Burry in shorting ARK Invest was when Tesla soared and actually met ARK's bizarre target prices, they just raised the target price anticipating faster growth. However, in 2022 with rising interest rates it hasn't made anyone back down over there, and now they're issuing equally **aggressive growth targets** for the physical **Tesla factories**, arguing growth over the next few years will outpace all previous years. This isn't just **insane** autism, this **flatly contradicts** the **facts** on the ground. The previous pace of factory setup was so rushed it caused lawsuits, and Tesla is closing their unprofitable Shanghai factory and slashing prices to compete with other EV companies and has no known plans to build more factories at the moment. The only thing going for them is that other less skilled EV companies are going under in the credit crunch and Mr. Musk told his employees to ignore the market and keep making cars. But in any case, for some time now I and many others have believed most if not all of ARK's investments are bubbles, and we were all at least partially right.Inexperience certainly is a factor because they **threw John Deere** stock **in** the **Space ETF**, with their research officer thinking they were mighty clever finding value in that John Deere does a lot of work with precision GPS mapping for their tractors. While John Deere is a solid stock in its own right (they supply the most essential equipment to the most essential industry), the idea they'd profit any more than marginally from space exploration is silly.Also, they invested heavily in everything connected to decentralized finance, and we all know by now that's a [decentralized Ponzi scheme.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/zm8q76/decentralized_money_is_unlikely_to_survive_the/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)  However, I have no idea whether ARK Invest knew this at the time or if they were duped like many were for a time.But perhaps the most **suspicious** thing ARK Invest does is their **Adjusted Earnings Reports**. There are strict GAAP rules (Generally Accepted Accounting Procedures) about what companies can and cannot report as earnings. Sometimes GAAP compliant books make a company look worse off that it is, so companies also publish adjusted earnings reports to show what they're thinking. Other times, it's just the execs trying to pump their own stock.ARK Invest is almost exclusively in pre-revenue companies since you want to grab the moonshots as early as possible. Near all of them are cash incinerators with leverage hidden via private equity investors, and ARK Invest presents their case with adjusted EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest Taxes Depreciation Amortization). However, ARK's adjusted earnings would be considered extremely brazen accounting **fraud if** it were remotely **subject to GAAP rules**.&amp;#x200B;1. All **R&amp;D costs are adjusted down** to the      average of the NASDAQ 100. The average NASDAQ company spends 12% of their      revenue on R&amp;D while ARK's portfolio spends an average of 27%. The      idea is this R&amp;D is an investment, not a cost.2. **Identical treatment**      for **sales/marketing** as this is too is an investment, not an      expense... Somehow.3. **Identical treatment**      for **employee stock** and options. ARK's companies pay an      average of 23% of their employee compensation in stock, many times the      norm. Again, they say this is an investment, not a cost.4. **Ignore** all      **non-cash costs**. This includes equipment/buildings breaking down      over time, which by GAAP rules is allowed to show up as a monthly cost as      a portion of the total cost of the asset.5. **Recognize deferred revenue**. This is when a customer pays in advance for something      they receive in the future. I.E. By GAAP rules if you buy a plane ticket      now it's not allowed to be counted as revenue until you use the ticket.      ARK's companies are often loaded with preorders for products that are not      fully invented yet, so this is a bigger deal than it looks.There's probably more, but I'm not an accountant. However, **by ARK's metrics**, all the **cash incinerators** they own are either **breaking even** or **are wildly profitable**. You can imagine the type of racket there can be cooking the books for companies on your own initiative and getting paid a fee to do so. However, it is not clear if this is the motive, as we may still be dealing with young and stupid investors who don't know a thing about accounting.But... ARK owns **10% or greater** position in **17** different **small cap** companies and has large stakes in **dozens** of **OTC stocks** and never backed down from these illiquid investments even when they had record inflows. They can definitely be a **whale** with interest in their own fund driving up the price of the underlying assets. Also, the average investor is chasing fund returns, meaning the bigger year over year returns equals more fund inflows and more fees generated. ARK's **worst performing year** actually **generated** the **most revenue** for the company as that is when AUM (Assets Under Management) reached their highs.Needless to say, ARK's portfolio's **behave suspiciously similar** to a **leveraged S&amp;P** fund both in long-term performance and daily volatility. They were likewise demolished by rising interest rates as equity investments behave like leverage even if they're not counted as liabilities. Personally, I pray the Fed keeps interest rates where they are so that we have no more of these fools and frauds we've seen in recent years. Which one is ARK?

"Hi everyone i'm a guy from Italy, today i would like to talk about a company who's making a huge comeback in those years: NIKOLA CORP.As you probably guys know about this company, especially regarding the stock market, i would like to talk a little bit... hopefully you are gonna take me with a serious manner.Nikola is making trucks, electric and also Hydrogen (on going, but should be out in the market h2 2023). But why this is so important: well, as European Nikola is backed from IVECO which is one of the biggest company in the trucking industries. So having a strong partner that help this start-up to emerge in the mkt is a fantastic opportunities in the US, but especially in Europe.The focus of this company is hydrogen, also electric but with less effort, because this particular molecule is going to be revolutionary in this sector... why?\- The trucks are going to use less battery to make power = less weight and more cargo;\- Dispatching a huge electric battery is going to be expensive and also bad for the environment;\-Hydrogen can haul cargo for more miles (at least we're talking from 500 miles and beyond). Of course this numbers are Nikola trucks;\- Huge collaboration with US and EU hydrogen facilities: they recently sign a partnership with plug power in the US, as well as TA and TC energy. But in Europe they sign a partnership with E.ON energy, one of the biggest hydrogen and renewable energy in Germany and Europe, but why is it so important? with these collaborations, it should be enough to lower the total cost of the truck compared to a diesel in terms of fuel, maintenance and price to acquire. Another important thing, about the US, 240k + 40k incentives from California (probably other state such as NY soon) to purchase one or as a fleet, the second (40k) is from the IRA available from 2023.\-They are also going to produce their own hydrogen stations and hub to meet the demand by themself, so create a network useful for every kind of miles that a trucker has to do. Doing this should also lower the price of hydrogen to be more competitive with diesel and gasoline.&amp;#x200B;There are many thing to write, but in my opinion this is a one in a lifetime opportunity to invest in... if you are young, just like me, i could give you a nice payback in 5 years, they need one thing tho: raise capital. in Order to have as many money to invest and make everything in the right way, nikola must have a stock price higher than now (at least 15-20 or above). Short float is around 30-35% which is pretty high for a company (not as high as GME of course)... so why not a short squeeze? payback should be huge, especially with options because of their low price.I'm sorry for my English, i try to write in a possible better way, and thank you for the attention you guys can give to this article.. if not no worries, i still love you all.Happy new year to all.","NIKOLA, the future of trucking... a revolution among this sector",1,self.wallstreetbets,1037fdg,Smooth_Fondant4878,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1037fdg/nikola_the_future_of_trucking_a_revolution_among/,1672848747,2890,64,10,522,0.03,0.789,0.181,0.998,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

" So, if you don't know, a new president has been elected in Brazil, who is a socialist based president and plans to take $PBR, or Petrobas, into an age of government control over parts of the Brazilian economy. The stock plummeted by over 10% when this news came out. &amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/jibdpe19s1aa1.png?width=1605&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b27f74566a7f72f48687cadac167ba48c88ae0c9 [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-criticism-lulas-economic-plans-151648109.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-criticism-lulas-economic-plans-151648109.html)Lula's policy is a worker's policy. So, from what I know, Petrobas is going to lose a lot of value in the coming years until they can regain control over their company, which requires a different president or for the current one to change policy, which wont' happen. I'm concerned about other investments having similar issues, like Vale mining.&amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/fer1x7ybs1aa1.png?width=1629&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3ccf56688788936531f8fec44b4e9a68fa4d350 My average cost is close to 18 per share for Vale. It's starting to drop, which is fine in normal conditions, but this might be a bad sign, or a good sign to buy more when the stock goes down enough. Like around $12 or $10. I'm just wondering what more educated people on here would do based on past experiences. Is this the kind of political situation where it's not going to affect all Brazil's stocks, only the ones where the president takes over the company's prices/operations, or will this be a new turn in their economy and I should get the hell out?I just never dealt with South America until I bought this stock so I have no clue what it's like down there.",What is happening in Brazil and how will the new President's policies affect stocks,1,self.wallstreetbets,1036ubm,Spare-Competition-91,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1036ubm/what_is_happening_in_brazil_and_how_will_the_new/,1672847350,1720,83,14,236,0.074,0.857,0.068,-0.6713,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

"A hallmark of the pandemic era has been the surge in employee turnover. Since 2021, an extraordinary number of Americans have been quitting their jobs — some flexing their power in a white-hot labor market, others re-evaluating their priorities amid a destabilizing pandemic.    One after another, employees at the New Hampshire manufacturer W.H. Bagshaw said goodbye.  One went to a robotics company in nearby Boston. Another became an electrician’s apprentice. In all, 22 workers have left W.H. Bagshaw in the past two years — no small matter for a company that has a work force of fewer than 50. That level of departures was also far from normal: In 2019, the company lost just one or two employees; the turnover rate in 2022 was over 30 percent.  W.H. Bagshaw, which makes precision machined parts for the aerospace and medical industries, was mostly able to replace the workers who left — but at a cost. Hiring employees and bringing them up to speed could include teaching them how to operate complex, multi-axis turning machines. That took time and energy, preventing the company from running at full capacity.  Production slowed. The number of on-time deliveries to customers slipped.

"GM WSB,First, the Form Fore beta is now closed. Contact me to join the waitlist.**TL;DR** \- Large drop in insider trading this week, with most buy action stemming from block stakeholders (10%+ ownership). An already low participation count from companies and insiders dropped further this week, which I expect is partly driven by holidays.Below are notable buys from block stakeholders:* Q-Grv Vii Investment Partners increased their position in Chargepoint Holdings, inc ($CHPT / Industrials) by $11.9M on Dec. 27th (+6.16%)* Broadwood Partners purchased an additional \~$9M in Staar Surgical Co ($STAA / Health Care) on Dec. 27th, increasing their stake by 2.22%* Hill Path Capital Partners purchased an additional $7.5M in Dave &amp; Busters ($PLAY / Consumer Discretionary) on Dec. 28thIn addition, here are a few notable buys from other insiders:* **Roxanne Austin**, a Director at Crowdstrike Holdings ($CRWD / Information Technology), increased their position by 61.85% with a $2.49MM purchase on Dec. 27th* **Thomson Leighton**, the CEO of Akami Technologies ($AKAM / Information Technology), increased their position by 27.94% with a $75K purchase on Dec. 28th. Thomson also bought $25K in shares on Dec. 27thAnd some notable sales from insiders:* **Denise Johnson**, the Group President of Caterpillar Inc ($CAT / Industrials), unloaded 73.39% of her stake with a $5.7M sale on Dec. 27th. Johnson now owns 8,605 shares.* **Andres Gluski**, the President and CEO of Aes Corp ($AES / Utilities) sold 36.8% of his position for $21.3M on Dec. 28th* **Jay Snowden**, the President and CEO of Penn Entertainment ($PENN / Consumer Discretionary) decreased his stake by 21.29% with a $4.9M sale on Dec. 27th* **Alesia Haas**, the CFO of Coinbase ($COIN / Financials) sold 32.69% of their position with a $3.18M sale on Dec. 27thIt is understandably less clear why an insider decreases their position size. However, using Coinbase as an example, if the company CFO is unloading nearly a third of their shares… I would consider that a red flag.By monitoring insider trading, you will become more informed about the incentives of company executives and consequently make more educated decisions when it comes to your personal investment decisions. There is no question that alternative data traditionally has a high price point. That was a key motivation for me to produce these reports and start Form Fore - to level the playing field. I find alternative data to be flat-out interesting and want to put a spotlight on the suits.# High-Level Stats:* Purchases decreased from $974M to $35.6M (-96%)* Sales decreased from $869M to $186.8M (-79%)* Transactions decreased from 391 to 201 (-49%)* Companies represented in Form 4s decreased from 214 to 128 (-40%)   * Net buyers decreased from 27 to 22 (-19%)   * Net sellers decreased from 187 to 106 (-43%)* Insiders filing Form 4s decreased from 332 to 174 (-48%)   * Net buyers increased from 30 to 36 (+20%)   * Net sellers decreased from 302 to 138 (-54%)# Transaction Selection1. **All** **Open Market Transactions** from **December 26th - December 30th.** These are Form 4 filings with a Transaction Code of “P” or “S”. This narrows the scope to trades where insiders are putting their money on the line.2. **Both indirect and direct** transactions are included in the reports.3. Weekly comparisons are to transactions from **December 19th - December 23rd.**4. **No companies without a ticker** (e.g. opportunity/income/mutual funds).5. No penny stocks or banned tickers.# Further Context1. Form 4 data is impacted by a concept known as **backfill** which is par for the course with transactional data. The delay between the Filing Date and the Transaction Date is **\*roughly\*** 2 days and your mileage will vary. This means that **more transactions for past dates can arrive in future filings.** That is why looking at larger trends is key.2. To combat backfill, filings through this Tuesday are included **\*if\*** the transaction date is from the prior week. Otherwise, transactions from this week are excluded.3.

"*With over 150,000 people dismissed in 2022 alone, Dr. Techy has to warn that staff reduction still haunts Silicon Valley and is not gonna help out.*Silicon Valley are haunted with more announcements of job cuts on the way.&amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/6p4uv60qw0aa1.png?width=618&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f877cffd47cd46884389348df7c36ab7c60f7efTech companies have been laying workers off by the thousands over 12 months, faster than at any time during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is estimated that in 2022 alone, over 150,000 people are dismissed from their job at some of the biggest players in tech – Meta, Amazon, Netflix, and Google – and smaller firms and startups as well. Despite layoffs drastically slowing in 2021, position cuts in tech firms rebound rapidly in 2022 amid interest rate hikes and a slowing economy. Since COVID-19, a total of 249,151 employees have been fired by 1,539 tech firms, according to Layoffs.fyi, a website tracking layoff events from media reports and company releases. Roughly 1,000 technology-driven companies across industries cut 153,160 jobs through the last troubled year, the online tracker counted. Companies are estimated to reduce 80,000 staff in March-December 2020 and 15,000 in all of 2021.The 2022 figure includes job slashings by Facebook parent Meta Platforms, which announced more than 11,000 layoffs in November alone, as well as some 10,000 potential job cuts by Amazon. Consumer and retail-based companies in the tech sector were some of the hardest hit.&amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/q9i82hxqw0aa1.png?width=397&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21de4085cca7e0c7743f5cfc27646d373c8c12d7The online tracker counted that nearly 100 healthcare-related tech firms dismissed an estimated 11,000 employees last year. Besides, although education tech companies grew rapidly during the school shutdown in 2022, operators in the same sector cut more than 8,000 jobs.For travel-related tech industries, massive layoffs followed the lockdowns and travel restrictions in 2020. However, as the world reopened and tourism revived in 2022, travel companies were among the sectors the least impacted by layoffs.As recession fears grow, cutting costs, especially layoffs, comes the first choice for companies. But does it work, or how much does workplace reduction help firms out?Layoffs don’t work to improve company performance, Dr. Techy believes.  Workplace reductions don’t do much for paring costs, which studies have shown that time after time. Severance packages cost money, layoffs increase unemployment insurance rates, and cuts reduce workplace morale and productivity as remaining employees are left wondering. And overfiring even causes embarrassing rehiring.&amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/rt3lf5fsw0aa1.png?width=693&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c20435695d4e826c06239f1f29d68a35fc4840b1The social media giant Twitter after laying off roughly half the company in Nov. following Elon Musk’s $44 billion acquisition, was reaching out to dozens of employees who lost their jobs and asking them to return just in days.What’s noteworthy, layoffs often do not increase stock prices, in part because layoffs can signal that a company is having difficulty. Job cuts do not solve what is often the underlying problem, which is often an ineffective strategy, a loss of market share, or too little revenue. Layoffs are basically a bad decision.*Layoffs are contagious within the tech industry. As fears grow at an exponential rate, it is going to spread across industries and within industries, Dr. Techy thinks.*","Dr. Techy| Silicon Valley saw 150K layoffs last year, a wayout helped little",1,self.wallstreetbets,1032ytc,Any-Lie-1107,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1032ytc/dr_techy_silicon_valley_saw_150k_layoffs_last/,1672836720,3587,76,13,492,0.135,0.823,0.042,-0.9912,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

" On Jan 3rd, the three major indexes all closed lower. At the close, the Dow dropped 0.03%, the Nasdaq dropped 0.76%, and the S&amp;P 500 dropped 0.4%..The 10-year US Treasury yield dropped 3.377% to 3.748%, compared with a yield spread of -63 bps over the two-year note while VIX was up 5.68%. Brent crude closed down 4.23%. Spot gold closed up 0.73% at $1,839.46 an ounce. The dollar index was up 0.88%, closing at 104.66..The final value of the US Markit Manufacturing PMI in December was 46.2, the lowest since May 2020. According to institutions, the decline in demand for inputs and the increase in the supply of raw materials from suppliers have led to further easing of inflationary pressures. In fact, input price inflation is below trend. The rate of increase in sales prices has also slowed, although it is still rising sharply. The slowing rise in inflation points to the impact of Fed policy on prices, but rising uncertainty and slumping demand suggest that the challenges facing manufacturers will extend into the new year.**Trending Stocks**[**Bilibili (BILI)**](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NASDAQ-BILI/)&amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/sw077cowl0aa1.png?width=532&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f8ab5c16d670a926d9bba723489347e5c2d66741Bilibili stock roses 13.97% after its New Year's Eve party ""The Most Beautiful Night Bilibili Party in 2022"" hosted by Bilibili has been trending.

"Higher Fed interest rates damp the housing market by raising mortgage rates and making homes less affordable. In the past quarter-century, moves in mortgage rates have occurred in anticipation of Fed rate increases, as shown in the chart below. In Mr. Powell’s words, “Markets are thinking, what’s the central bank going to do?”The Fed didn’t hike until March 2022, but for the housing market, tightening started in January 2021, when mortgage rates started rising. They have since risen by more than in any cycle since 1981.https://preview.redd.it/ji4wf8xdaz9a1.jpg?width=794&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b752d4c751a623f7382f27fd35d520e20f3a9ac9 As higher rates make homes less affordable, housing activity slows.

"\*This is not about budgeting, debt, education, loans, credit, emergency funds, jobs, etc...\* \*This is about wealth accumulation, not preservation\*You are a young adult and want to invest your money, but there are endless ways to invest your money, pokemon cards, options, forex, gold, bonds, individual stocks, index funds, hedge funds, silver, cash, international equities, savings accounts, crypto, dividend investing, oil, real estate, private equity, and so much more, where do you even start?!??To start, why invest in the first place? Inflation. It eats away at everything, including investments, but your cash is sitting at a guaranteed loss, so you have to invest if you want to accumulate/preserve wealth in addition to any external income ex job.&amp;#x200B;Here are 3 rules of thumb when Investing:1. Simplicity is on your side2. Time is on your side3. Diversification is on your sideInvesting against any of these and the odds are **Against You** (*never impossible)*&amp;#x200B;Step 1) Invest 100% of your investible money into an S&amp;P500 index fund ""the golden standard"" of US investing. (constantly chasing diversification will come at the cost of the other rules. If you truly don't want to invest in the S&amp;P 500, the 3-fund strategy is the next best thing)Step 2) Chase optimization, you should research dividend reinvesting, different brokerages, ETF or MF, Fractional Shares, tax-efficient accounts, LSI or DCA, Tax Efficiency, and Lowest ERs possible for your S&amp;P500 Fund (constantly chasing optimization eventually becomes pointless similarly to diversification)Note: If you have boatloads of money (1M+ Invested), you are transitioning from wealth accumulation to preservation (a completely different Risk/Reward ratio) where diversification and optimization start to triumph over simplicity.Step 3) Sit down, hold on, and don't panic. Let compounding interest do its thing over time and you will outperform &gt;95% of all investors, including people that do this for a living that have access to limitless $$$.

"**Hello, I hope you are having a wonderful start to 2023...**This is some advice for new/smaller traders. The most important thing you can do right now is to learn who is full of shit and who isn't. I just landed a seasonal position at a prop desk as an intern. You don't have to take my word for it. But seriously, *do not listen to most of what you find on this sub...* This place, and the internet in general, is full of plain fools that don't study or do any meaningful work at all in finance. Many of our brethren here at WSB are simply too naive. Seeing any trade at all gets them drooling for risk and they immediately copy a horrible position, inevitably losing a little (if you are lucky) or a whole bunch of money.Every once in a while, a gem comes up out of the muck of memes and ass-hattery that we all know and love. Do yourself a favor and peruse basic economic theory written by proven experts. *Murphy and Sowell and Schwager are good places to start.* Get the right ideas into your head before a highly regarded post skews your perspectives. It will save you much time indeed.**Here are some basic tricks that I've learned through live trading:***On average, only one out of three trades are successful.*If you are expecting to win more than every other trade, you are definitely overconfident. It is completely normal for beginners to only succeed every three tries. Many traders think that finance is like a coin toss. It definitely isn't.*The market can be outperformed.*If you are smart about risk and volatility and utility and whatnot, you will eventually learn how to beat the annual returns on the S&amp;P, NASDAQ, and DOW. Do not listen to investment articles about being risk-averse and avoiding volatility. If you are in your twenties, you need to be looking for volatility and leverage. The traders at my desk are monstrous in terms of ROI. We're talking doubles, triples, quads, and so on. *For the love of God, please take notes.*Stop throwing money at trades like a cracked-out baboon. Get yourself a cheap ass notebook and a pen and write down at least three words about a trade before you decide to take it. Even if it is something stupid like, ""Thought it was good."" or ""Chart looked promising."" This will propel you far ahead of more than half of the entire trading population. It will help you think about why you took a trade and eventually allow you to learn more about how trades actually work technically and fundamentally.*Listen to your nerves.*Trading isn't just a mental thing. It's how you choose to live your life. At a high-level, good trading is knowing what to do and when to do it based on knowledge and experience. There are no easy ways to go about it. You will most likely feel anger, anxiety, shame, denial, and so on. Treat your notional capital like points in a video game. It isn't real anymore. It doesn't matter if it goes up or down. What matters is how you trade and why you do it. It will keep you rational and logical. If you are in a losing streak and want to make back what you lost, take a break. There is nothing worse than overtrading and blowing up an account.**What should I be trading in 2023?**Buying shares is a crock of shit if you have less than $25K. Get approved for cash options trading and start experimenting with calls and puts. Pay attention to the SPY and QQQ. Learn about fundamental events and how they affect markets. Central bank policy is a big one that many people track. They basically control the long-term direction of the stock market. It involves how cheap it is to borrow money from banks, which affects the total money supply of the global economy. Right now, things aren't looking so good for speculative assets. Finding overvalued sectors to buy puts in is a good idea. Buying gold is a good idea. If you want to make money this year, it's either finding a safe haven for cash or betting on the market bleeding for most of the year.*Feel free to DM me if you have any questions or want to tell me to fuck off. Have a nice week!*",Tips for absolute beginners.,1,self.wallstreetbets,102stz8,monolithtrader,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/102stz8/tips_for_absolute_beginners/,1672803475,4027,28,4,729,0.086,0.758,0.157,0.9957,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

"**Recap On Tuesdays Market Action:*** SPY closed down 0.42%* QQQ closed up 0.68%* Dow Jones Industrial closed down 0.03%* VIX closed up 5.86%Good evening everyone, today the markets opened with a bang and went out with a whimper. The major indices all gapped up but quickly pulled back and broke the previous days lows. However, some ground was recovered as we were able to close near the middle of todays price range.https://preview.redd.it/9yn1h6uuuw9a1.png?width=2275&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d39579052328f0a23e5c33aaaea39b6cc6f8895For the past two weeks SPY has been range bound between $388 and $374. There is major overhead resistance in the form of selling pressure and moving averages. SPY is not in a strong position at the moment and will need to make very decisive moves for that opinion to change. Tomorrow there are two news announcements that may move SPY out of this range. At 10 am we have the ISM Manufacturing Index but more importantly at 2 am we have the FOMC Minutes release. The FOMC Minutes may give investors a better glimpse into how the Fed thinking of managing interest rates. This news may cause the market to move rapidly in either direction. Be careful if you are holding positions into this announcements or if you plan to open a position soon after.**Watchlist:**Many of the watchlist stocks discussed [yesterday](https://everydaytrades.com/market-outlook-01-02-2023/) pulled back from their entry positions today. However, there are always other stocks available to look at.https://preview.redd.it/4sgvplfvuw9a1.png?width=2260&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80dc945d5c2677cf68c4a69c44545b64c2d466fdCPR (Catalyst Pharmaceuticals) is still in a somewhat decent position. There was an increase in selling volume today but it was not strong enough to break recent lows and price is still above the 21 day EMA. We would need both a steady market and a strong rebound in priced with volume to enter this stock at approximately $19.10. For all stocks regardless of industry or price action it is best to exercise caution especially in the current market environment.https://preview.redd.it/wezsne0wuw9a1.png?width=2263&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8ac7738f5b970fdee56a427c9c0cd90d025a85d1MMP (Magellan Midstream Partners) is in the oil and gas industry and performed relatively well today compare to some of its peers. A break of downward sloping trendline could serve as a buy signal along with heavy volume. Sales and EPS of this company are up 14.49% and 46.96% year over year respectively. There is also 9.4 day of short interest! This means if the shorts are forced to cover it would take them 9.4 days, that is alot of buying volume. The share price is currently around 8% off of recent highs, if the market picks up and the stock price gets close to the recent high some of these short may be forced to cover.https://preview.redd.it/huf9jnkwuw9a1.png?width=2261&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=711e4ec5de258c63bf37720f083982bad1bed143TBBK (The Bancorp) is a financial holding company that had good price action and volume today. It is nearing a base breakout and has a trigger price of $29.60. Additionally, there is 5.2 days of short interest and this stock is sitting at 10% below all time highs.**Bringing everything together:**This is not what a healthy market looks are acts like. There are still several steps that need to be taken before the markets start to trend upwards again. Hopefully, the Fed minutes will show the light at the end of the tunnel, but you cannot depend solely on that. What we need to do know is manage are risk and positions carefully. Just because the main indices are not well does not mean that there are no opportunities. We need to cherry pick the best stocks and manage them according. Overall, take profits quickly and do not be afraid to cut losers short.Please feel free to comment any thoughts or additional comments below.",Stocks to watch 01/04/2023,1,self.wallstreetbets,102mrwj,everyday_trades,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/102mrwj/stocks_to_watch_01042023/,1672787623,3920,26,4,587,0.069,0.817,0.114,0.986,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

"Happy New Years everyone! I hope you guys had a great weekend! Remember this is a new year and a new time for us. Whatever happened last year don’t bring that into 2023 with you. &amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/0cw36wlqfw9a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc55d9f6a71436a885f3f8cb2b8e160838410518Looking at the daily chart here on SPY you can see despite the beautiful diamond pattern we had on SPY, Futes and the VIX and spy/ futes breaking out of that diamond we actually ended up with a hard rejection and a red day. One interesting note today is that on 12/22 we had that phantom daily range with the upside being at 386.21… that level was unfilled and untouched up until today. That was an interesting level to see a rejection at. With the diamond pattern broken we should have expected upside… however, we actually ended up getting a support retest at 378 AND at the red support line. This now makes this 378 level and the red support line even stronger than it was before. From here like I mentioned last week I am bullish until we see 378 closed below and we hold below that level for more than one day. This upside push this morning did retest and reject the daily 20ema which is going to be a critical level for bulls to retake before we can see a retest of 390.1 resistance. Key support- 380.8 -&gt; 379.6 -&gt; 378Key resistance- 384.4 -&gt; 386.3&amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/s8nsin8rfw9a1.png?width=903&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9fdbdf9077bcc38bdacd57aa3e959500e56b78b8Small morning data dump with job openings and quits… we also have FOMC minutes at 2pm. Historically looking at past FOMC minute days they actually tend to be a bit of a pivot in markets. This is now our 11th day of consolidation in this area… we really should start looking for a breakout one way or another. If FOMC minutes is not the catalyst… then CPI next Thursday will be that catalyst. We have some forecast numbers out on CPI but still waiting on official consensus numbers. Will be very interesting to see where those numbers come in… the preliminary numbers I am seeing are giving a slightly bearish (miss) vibe. The MoM CPI and CORE MoM numbers are not looking very favorable. CORE YoY is looking to go either way… however, some numbers are showing a possible rebound on CPI YoY while others show a continued unwind and an ever more bullish print in the low to mid 6s… still need to wait till early next week for that play to see where we end up at. &amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/qi5s33prfw9a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cee158596694e71fb9879c3b59a8ee281768dc79The Futures daily chart shows the pattern the best in my opinion… it shows that this 3840 to 3845 area is a very key support area. Not only that we came down and held support at 3815 today. Now taking a look at the upside we did have a huge open last night that came up and rejected 3905/3910 resistance area and end up with a rejection at the daily 20ema too. We have some really nice levels here that we are going to keep an eye on throughout the rest of the week. Bulls are going to look to hold this as support of that red support line and will look to retrace 3873 tomorrow. If they can do that with a favorable reading of the FOMC minutes we will look at a push to 3920 by EOW. Support- 3840 -&gt; 3805 Resistance- 3873 -&gt; 3895 -&gt; 3920Poor Tesla getting absolutely punished today. Hitting nearly -15% at one point. &amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/ee80op8sfw9a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d128de9ba029c815bf28abdf1e621d4c6f63b819For those of you who missed It…. So from what I am seeing Tesla actually hit about 40% vs the 50% they anticipated. A small miss in my opinion… but play it as it lies. &amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/tx0u0apsfw9a1.png?width=738&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fdff0b9a7a011f0425806d0bf443190f5fa2a28aTaking a look at our cycles now we have officially reached the peak and started our next cycle down. No telling how low that cycle will take us though. But from high to low we are sitting at nearly -16.6%... we have on average about another 8% to fall over 7 days which puts tesla near $94.3 by 1-12. IF you guys remember that 94.4 level is a major support from 2020 so that would definitely put us at a major level if we did get a continued sell off the rest of this week. I was looking at a consolidation week on Tesla but it appears we are actually starting the next leg down… if trend holds correctly we could see 3 more weeks of downside before we get a bounce. &amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/zb34u34tfw9a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb1baae500d2b4dbda397ca893fcc7623de3dff0Really nice red falling wedge formed here on Tesla daily along with a blue bear channel too… If you note that thicker dark red line at the bottom that is the overall 2022/23 bear channel support line I have for tesla (refer back to previous TA for a zoomed out view of this). Support- 101.3 (dark red support) Resistance- 113 -&gt; 118.7&amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/c2jfafuvfw9a1.png?width=612&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d47e2c4bd292047cae73ad8af157b5a392f482b6Perhaps the most intriguing part of today was that the VIX actually opened up very green about 6%+ and SPY had opened green. A very intriguing anomaly that does not usually happen. IT was a good clue that one was about to give. Mid day the VIX actually looked convincingly bearish (as in we were going to see downside for the markets). We had a nice push to that key 23.6 level and sat there for quite a long time. However, with this rejection here at 23.6 and this possible evening start doji forming here we should expect the VIX to retrace back to the 22 area tomorrow which should give markets a boost. One note with FOMC minutes tomorrow is that we could see a small uptick in the VIX leading into FOMC minutes at 2pm. However, the VIX should unwind by EOD. **Daily log-**I played the odds on a green open post quarterly options expiration and the reaped the rewards of that. The three day weekend unfortunately cause those calls to not be as great of a win as they should have been. But the play was there. I am actually am highly dissatisfied with the play as when I bought my calls IV was about 12 and at open we saw IV near 40-50 on calls and near 60-70 on puts… we should have seen a pretty massive pump on premiums and with a large 0.5% green open OTM calls should have seen a much large gain at open then they did. But unlike the 3 day weekend for xmas we actually saw premiums take a huge hit with that 3 day weekend. Intraday today finally felt like the technical were back to normal. A few times we had premiums moving a little oddly on 0dte but for the most part playing level to level today with the help of technical was spot on and very rewarding. &amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/kdv4sd8ufw9a1.png?width=708&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2cd18fa737419c3b38f0e45ac40ebcacd26f72cdStarting 2023 off on a very nice green note.

"Michael Burry forecasted 2023 as a year with economic recovery leading to increased inflation. We've got ourselves a banger it seems. The SPY market for options expiring on 1/6 looks like this:1. There has been sustained bias towards PUTS which connotes a bearish feeling (image 1)2. In case of a bullish reversal, there are two major resistance levels at strikes $385 and $390 (image 2)3. Support levels for SPY are sparse, one is at $375 and an absolute mammoth support line at $355 (image 3)4. Strike $385 is currently delta hedged by 850K units of SPY stock or equivalents while strike $390 is hedged by 475K. If the price of SPY doesn't reach this levels, these CALLs will be closed and the hedges sold which will depress the price of SPY even further. (image 4)5. There are $3B of currently not delta hedged calls up to strike $390, in the case of a sudden bullish reversal, MMs can some of this gun powder to short the stock to temporarily depress the price below $385 or $390 and render the contracts worthless at expiration.

"Hello everyone, back before a 1:15 reverse split I had bought a put option at a $0.50 strike price to hedge against a long position in ABCD. After the reverse split, the strike price remained unchanged but my option went from being a ABCD put to a ABCD1 put.

"*Folks, on the very last trading day of 2022, it’s time to review the events of 2022 with Dr. Techy.*Take a look back at 2022, it is a dramatic and eventful year that no one has ever had expected. The outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war shocked the World and pains still linger. Over-hot inflation urged central banks to hike rates globally and aggressively. Euro rumbled to parity against soaring US dollar. China finally dropped Covid-19 restrictions. Elon Musk’s Twitter buyout polished him the most popular internet celebrity…Here are the most influential events that happened in global markets for 2022 in review.**Event 1: Russia-Ukraine war outbreak**&amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/vjhi0m80ut9a1.png?width=693&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d808fc7d0490a763c3478784734387dc0543465On February 24, Russian invaded Ukraine. Russian benchmark index plunged as much as 50% after the war outbreak. The very next day, Russia’s Central Bank announced that the Moscow Exchange suspended stock trading from Feb. 28. After a nearly month-long break, Russia resumed stock trading, with 33 securities traded on the Moscow Exchange. Stocks rose as short-selling was officially banned. By the way, there are more sufferings ongoing outside the markets.The EU, US, and their allies committed to removing Russian banks from the SWIFT payment system, as well as imposing measures on the Russian Central Bank and further restrictions on Russian elites. *Dr. Techy: Wishes for love &amp; peace in 2023!***Event 2: Prices on the rise** https://preview.redd.it/zj641wc1ut9a1.png?width=693&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=17abc83047ce04bf040c140773880508aba75a082022 saw years-high inflation across the world. U.S. inflation hit a 40-years high in April and continued to climb in the following months. American consumer prices index (CPI) came in at 9.1% at its fastest pace in nearly 13 years amid a burst in used vehicle costs and price increases in food and energy. In addition, Europe also suffered price increases, with CPI reaching record highs for 12 consecutive months. Global inflation is forecast to rise from 4.7 percent in 2021 to 8.8 percent in 2022, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said in a new report on Oct. 11. *Dr. Techy: Inflation sucks, and it also sucks my profits.***Event 3: Fed gets aggressive** https://preview.redd.it/hxek0ja2ut9a1.png?width=628&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39ccf41b395b920afbded49baa784b8f9d68454aSticky inflation led Fed to increase rates aggressively. The Federal Reserve (Fed) raised rates seven times and by a total of 425 bps since March when it established its hawkish approach to curtailing inflation. It is the most aggressive start to a tightening cycle in the last 40 years. The federal funds rate target is 4.25%-4.50%, which is the highest range since 2007.In addition, to tame the rising prices, central banks overseeing the 10 most heavily traded currencies delivered 2,700 basis points (bps) of tightening in 54 rate hikes over the past 12 months.*Dr. Techy: So, how soon will the Fed cut rates?***Event 4: Dollars spikes, Euro bitters**&amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/hmgo0m63ut9a1.png?width=590&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed9f03bf5ea006c9551bf7b108e6a731b484704eThe dollar enjoyed one of its strongest years ever, up almost 9% year-to-date, as the Federal Reserve was the first central bank among developed economies to rein on stubbornly high inflation with an aggressive tightening. The US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the buck against a basket of currencies, rose to 110.01 in September. This is the index’s best level in more than 20 years, lifting its year-to-date rally to nearly 15%. Over the last 12 months, the DXY has surged about 18%.The euro hit parity with the U.S. dollar on July 13, meaning the two currencies had a 1:1 exchange rate. That hasn’t occurred since 2002 when the euro was in its infancy. At the currency’s low point, €1 was briefly worth $0.9999 before a slight rebound.*Dr. Techy: Well, that's good news for Americans traveling to Europe.***Event 5: China drops Covid-19 restrictions** https://preview.redd.it/qv7fdow3ut9a1.png?width=693&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c240a6b7502d92e23e18bdeca63303df546ab9e8China announced to reopen borders and abandon quarantine on December 26, in one of the country’s most significant steps toward reopening since the coronavirus pandemic began. The decision is the country’s last step in shedding three years of zero-Covid and pivoting to living with the virus.*Dr. Techy: Congrats to China.***Event 6: Energy backfire: oil &amp; gas** https://preview.redd.it/yizl5ru4ut9a1.png?width=693&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a99af9b45c557399e0a3394e08ad7b6a0402cea2Crude oil futures spent much of 2022 surging amid Russia’s invasion and demand returning. Brent crude futures rose above $139 per barrel in March, the highest since 2008. Then, oil prices fluctuated lower after mid June and gave up most of gains for the year, even down below the pre-Ukraine crisis level in November. The turnaround came after the U.S. and OECD countries implemented unprecedented production cuts, and OPEC+ also squeezed production again in October.Besides roiling oil, Europe went through a gas crisis due to the supply chain. While Dutch TTF gas futures was traded at 89 euros/MWh on Feb. 23, the day before Ukraine war broke out, the prices continued to surge and peaked at nearly 350 euros/Mwh on August, hitting record highs. All of a sudden, however,  Europe has more natural gas than it knows what to do with. The European spot price for gas dipped into negative territory and once down at -15.78 euros/Mwh on Oct. 24, an all-time low.*Dr. Techy: Too much or too few,  it’s not a good idea.***Event 7: Ghost of 2008 still haunts U.S. stock market** https://preview.redd.it/54ygw6n5ut9a1.png?width=693&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1727bb685c3720a1aa289034c49df6b180b1bb28Stocks are headed for their worst yearly performance since 2008. The S&amp;P, one of the broadest measures of the health of Corporate America, fell by 19.7% at Tuesday’s close while the Nasdaq index’s fallen 33.8% year to date. The Dow index is off by 8.5%. Markets have tanked thanks to four-decade highs in inflation and the Federal Reserve’s hawkish response. No major asset class—stocks, bonds, real estate, crypto—has gone unscathed.What’s worse, equity listings on the Nasdaq fell about 80% this year, as the appetite for new issues took a hit from extreme volatility in the stock market. A total of 156 companies listed their shares on the bourse this year, raising nearly $15 billion in initial public offerings, a far cry from 743 firms that raised $180 billion in what was a blockbuster 2021, data from the exchange operator showed.*Dr. Techy: Why the ghost of 2008 still haunts us in 2022?***Event 8: Crypto collapses: to the moon, down to earth** https://preview.redd.it/wk8m84e6ut9a1.png?width=693&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=715c604e0d796dd879e7355514470f40d4e4d059""To the moon!"" Much of crypto did graze the stratosphere at the start of 2022 when enthusiasm was astronomically high, but a few months later it all came crashing back down to Earth. Bitcoin's value is roughly a fourth of what it was a year ago, and the industry is just starting to grapple with the fallout from the catastrophic implosion of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX.In the future, 2022 may be regarded as a turning point for the world of virtual currencies, when they lost their luster and were cast out as a fringe product most people approach with skepticism and caution. Or it may simply be remembered as a stretch of excruciating growing pains for an industry still in its infancy.

The total number of layoffs in U.S. technology companies reached 80,978 in the first 11 months, an increase of 535% year-on-year, and the scale of layoffs hit a new high in 20 years, according to data from Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas, a Chicago-based global outplacement &amp; career transitioning firm.https://preview.redd.it/6zstbj69ut9a1.png?width=314&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d14f6ebcd0cf3225c67d85a4877a4b08d0f6852*Dr. Techy: Has silicon valley 'lost its mojo'?***Event 10: Elon Musk** https://preview.redd.it/8aue0w9aut9a1.png?width=672&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d6c3c8f1d575a9ec25fcc1b10d2a6425b295f5e1If there was one person driving the news cycle in 2022, it was Elon Musk. He started 2022 as the world’s richest person and ends it as the second richest person on Earth after his takeover of Twitter Inc.. The multi-billionaire is distracted from his electric-vehicle business, people think. Tesla's stock price has fallen nearly 70% in 2022, with 767.9 billion US dollars evaporated.

Fundamental analysis looks to see whether an investment is overvalued or undervalued based on underlying economic conditions, as well as the finances of the company or other organization that issued a stock or bond. Technical analysis instead looks at patterns in the price of an investment to predict future movements in that investment’s price.I look for tickers that are trading at least 2 million in volume a day, with a market-cap of no less than 500 million.The shares traded are compared to the average volume to determine how much of the float is used (Or shares traded). That information is compiled with data on how profitable the company is and how much cash do they have compared to what is expected.||Things to consider when finding the plays-· If the stock volume has traded 1 million or more in volume premarket, I will use that and calculate a rough estimate on what the stock will trade for the day.· If the ticker looks to be trading more volume than the day before, I will consider it for a long play. If trading less than the movement of the ticker, I would consider a short or put play. (If all the other factors previously mentioned checks out.)· The trades are researched afternoon daily to find possible tickers making a big move.

" The telecom industry is facing a disproportionate demand and supply due to poor user experience and low accessibility of connectivity for consumers. Thus, those who develop and operate telecom networks don't have enough clients, which can lead to prolonged development of the market and skyrocketing service prices.But with Weaver Labs, that's no longer the case. Their ecosystem aims to improve accessibility, enhance the user experience with a software-based platform, and unite those who build networks with those who consume them.They've developed Cell-Stack, a software stack that aggregates all telecoms infrastructure and opens it up to be consumed as a service. It acts as an open marketplace of telecommunications assets, using blockchain technology to create a ""network of networks"" and bridge the gap in the telecoms area.Cell-Stack offer s two types of followers } to interact with it: the supply side (those who own telecoms infrastructure) and the demand side (those who want to consume services). Blockchain technology is used to solve friction when accessing telecoms infrastructure, serving as a key governance component of the marketplace and coordinating trust among all the different players of the network.With the rise of cloud networks and the open access model, which is more focused on users than on functionalities, now is the perfect moment to innovate the telecoms sector with cutting-edge Web 3.0. solutions.Look at their subreddit at [r/Weaver\_Labs](https://www.reddit.com/r/Weaver_Labs/)/ as well as their Medium page at [https://medium.com/weaver-labs](https://medium.com/weaver-labs) to learn more about the project",Weaver Labs is aiming to bridging the gap between Web 3.0. and Telecoms by building something that has never been done before,1,self.wallstreetbets,1027b4n,Ok-Restaurant6879,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1027b4n/weaver_labs_is_aiming_to_bridging_the_gap_between/,1672750013,1650,125,22,240,0.041,0.859,0.099,0.9273,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

"I mentioned in my last post [Part 1](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/zzqokq/2023_lfg_part_1_where_are_we_now/) that I was drunk and inflation wasn't going anywhere.I firmly believe that inflation is already baked in as producers/manufacturers are STILL suffering from relatively high energy and material/commodity prices. Supply chain issues may seem to be solved but it's only better as you can ship your product on time IF you can get everything on your assembly line/plant on time. It's not that they can't meet the demand at full capacity. It's just that most factories cannot run at full capacity. Soon they won't have to, with consumers going broke. Many analysts expect Americans to run out of savings by mid-year. So even if we solve all supply chain issues, there won't be demand to pump more products. This will force manufacturers to cut supply and increase prices. Hence inflation... Prices are sticky. They will neither go down nor slow down at a reasonable pace as expected. This time it's different. Bailouts: They already happened. Covid relief and M2 pump... yea... that's your ""liquidity"" in the markets. Balance sheet is already huge. That's a bailout for finance. JPOW is not rushing to pull money out of the system for a reason. In the next year, many businesses will fail and go bankrupt. This doesn't mean that market will crash. Market will only crash if they run out of liquidity. If I'm reading between the lines right at JPOW's speeches, he will keep liquidity high. They will NOT lower interest rates because they can't at a time of high inflation. This scenario can be familiar to those who have lived/worked in developing countries. Real stagflation will be a unfamiliar experience for western central banks because they haven't really seen it in decades. Furthermore, it never hit when finance was this complicated and interconnected worldwide with so much more leverage than there has ever been in the past. The great reset is almost necessary at this point. The gears of economy starts turning with a single dollar spent by a consumer. There is nothing else that can turn the rest of the gears except for ""bail outs"" which is only a temporary relief. China, despite all the covid talk, can produce and export a lot more than it imports. This will not change. Even if their housing bubble bursts, they will contain it, like they have been doing so. Canada will probably go bankrupt in a year or two. There is no sugar coating it. In a country where people are already house-rich cash-poor, there is no saving it when variable interest loans make up a high portion of consumer debt. Many mom and pop real state investors built variable debt over variable debt with HELOCs. At some point something will have to give. Even if everyone spends every cent to service their debt, main street will die... layoffs... then bankruptcies. As of today foreigners cannot buy real estate legally (unless they use some shell company and a Canadian ""buddy"").Euro zone is giving the biggest trade deficits in recent years with energy crisis really affecting every.single.entity. A rumour I've recently heard is that some auto manufacturers are able to build most of the car but cannot get windshields on time. So they sit in a lot somewhere waiting for completion. Turns out glass-making requires a lot of energy. EU is the contagion that will keep on giving with the war, production, and political issues. One favourable piece of data is that most of Europe is ""socialist"" for you cowboys. They have low consumer debt. They have some slack there. But with the interest rates climbing to 5-6 percent range in the next year, this may change. Europe is still playing a lot of things by the book. For example, they still have their fractional reserve requirements in effect, unlike US of A. It will be roller coaster of a year to say the least. Market ""analysts"" will infer nonexistent messages and pump the markets for a few up days. It will be pretty much like last 4-5 months. JPOW and co will ""disappoint"" analysts and ""the markets."" Then we'll have down days. Be extra fucking careful if you're playing options. Theta will not show mercy for those of us playing a month or two out. False narratives will move the market ""irrationally."" I'm expecting a prolonged slow declining bear market this year in general. But some sectors have already gone through a correction - such as tech stocks. This doesn't mean they will go up and moon this year. They will trade sideways. Those that haven't come down to Earth will have their corrections this year. Companies with high short term debt and negative cash-flows are a big no for me. If you're not making money, I don't think you'll make it in this climate. It's actually a good year for stock buybacks but big corps are full of regards. They like buying high. You don't have to watch for Dow Transportation index anymore. We get near real time data. Most of what's to be said is said and what's to be done is done. Now we wait. Traditionally, high inflation-high interest times show greater savings. People would rather save than spend. Thanks to high debt and leverage, this isn't the case anymore. So let THAT sink in. Good luck.TA:DR - Industries/Stocks that have gone through correction will trade sideways. Health and Insurance will perform poorly. Most industries will have new industry average PE ratios at a lower point AND they will have poor earnings.","2023 LFG!!! - Part 2 - Unpredictability of markets in high liquidity, high interest times with broke consumers",1,self.wallstreetbets,101yibr,Rim_World,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/101yibr/2023_lfg_part_2_unpredictability_of_markets_in/,1672721384,5439,110,18,921,0.104,0.807,0.089,-0.968,0.142,0.661,0.197,0.2677

"  **Summarize Book: Poor Charlie's Almanack****The Wit and Wisdom of Charles T. Munger****Peter D. Kaufman, Ed Wexler, Warren E. Buffett, Charles T. Munger**Poor Charlie's Almanack is a book containing a compilation of the wit and wisdom of Charles T. Munger, a successful businessman and investor who is best known as the vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway. The book is edited by Peter D. Kaufman, Ed Wexler, and Warren E. Buffett, and it contains a selection of Munger's talks, speeches, and writings, along with commentary and insights from others. The book covers a wide range of topics, including investing, psychology, decision-making, and personal development, and is filled with practical advice and lessons learned from Munger's extensive experience in business and investing. It is highly regarded as a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning from one of the most successful and influential thinkers of our time.**Provide 25 key takeaways with examples from this book**1. Invert, always invert: To make better decisions, try to think about the opposite of what you're trying to do and consider the consequences. For example, instead of trying to find ways to make a project succeed, consider all the ways it could fail.2. Multidisciplinary thinking is crucial: The best decisions are made by considering multiple viewpoints and disciplines. For example, a doctor who only thinks about medicine may not consider the financial implications of a treatment, while an accountant who only thinks about finances may not consider the medical consequences.3. Understand the power of incentives: People's behavior is largely driven by their incentives, so it's important to consider what's motivating someone when trying to understand their actions. For example, a salesperson's commission may be an incentive for them to sell a product that may not be in the best interest of the customer.4. Don't be swayed by peer pressure: Just because something is popular or widely accepted doesn't mean it's the best choice. For example, just because everyone else is investing in a certain stock doesn't mean it's a good investment for you.5. Know the difference between pleasure and happiness: Seeking pleasure can often lead to short-term gratification but may not lead to long-term happiness. For example, eating a slice of cake may bring temporary pleasure, but regularly indulging in unhealthy behaviors may not lead to long-term happiness.6. Don't let cognitive biases influence your decisions: Our brains are prone to certain biases that can distort our perception and judgment. For example, the sunk cost fallacy can cause us to continue investing time and resources into a project because we've already invested so much, even if it's not a good decision.7. Understand the value of simplicity: Simplicity is often the key to making good decisions. For example, a simple investment strategy may be more effective than a complex one.8. Be willing to change your mind: It's important to be open to new information and willing to change your mind when presented with evidence that contradicts your beliefs. For example, if new research shows that a previously held belief is incorrect, it's important to be willing to adjust your thinking.9. Embrace the concept of ""margin of safety"": When making decisions, it's important to consider the potential risks and have a ""margin of safety"" to protect against them. For example, when investing, it's a good idea to only invest in companies with strong financials to provide a margin of safety in case the market takes a downturn.10. Understand the role of compound interest: Compound interest can have a huge impact on long-term financial success. For example, starting to save for retirement in your 20s versus your 40s can make a significant difference in the amount you'll have saved by retirement age.11. Know your own limitations: It's important to be aware of your own strengths and weaknesses and not take on tasks that are beyond your abilities. For example, if you're not good at public speaking, it may not be a good idea to take on a job that requires a lot of public speaking.12. Be willing to take calculated risks: Taking calculated risks can lead to great rewards, but it's important to carefully consider the potential downsides as well. For example, starting a business can be a risky but potentially rewarding venture.13. Don't let emotions cloud your judgment: It's important to try to keep emotions in check when making important decisions. For example, it's not a good idea to sell a stock simply because you're feeling anxious about the market.14. Understand the concept of opportunity cost: Every decision has an opportunity cost15. Don't fall prey to the sunk cost fallacy: It's important to consider the future rather than being swayed by the amount of time, money, or resources already invested in a project.16. Learn from your mistakes: It's important to reflect on mistakes and failures and learn from them, rather than dwelling on them or making excuses.17. Don't let your ego get in the way: Ego can cloud judgment and lead to poor decisions. It's important to be aware of the role your ego plays in your decision-making process.18. Seek out diverse viewpoints: It's important to consider multiple perspectives and not get trapped in your own way of thinking.19. Understand the role of probability in decision-making: Probability can help guide decision-making, but it's important to be aware of the limitations and uncertainties of probability estimates.20. Don't over-optimize: It's important to consider the big picture and not get caught up in small details at the expense of the overall goal.21. Be open to new ideas: It's important to be open to new ideas and not get stuck in a certain way of thinking.22. Don't let fear hold you back: Fear can prevent people from taking necessary risks or pursuing opportunities. It's important to recognize and confront fear in order to make good decisions.23. Practice mental discipline: It's important to train the mind to think clearly and rationally, rather than letting emotions or biases cloud judgment.24. Seek out mentors and role models: It's valuable to seek out mentors and role models who can provide guidance and advice.25. Continuously learn and grow: It's important to continuously learn and grow in order to make better decisions and improve overall quality of life.&amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;[https://dfssinstitute.com/p/dfss-institute-free-articles-templates-and-videos](https://dfssinstitute.com/p/dfss-institute-free-articles-templates-and-videos)",Charlie Munger Investing book summary,1,self.wallstreetbets,101vfd8,DreamWeaverAdashiAde,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/101vfd8/charlie_munger_investing_book_summary/,1672712615,6589,37,5,1029,0.067,0.733,0.2,0.9993,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

"**Recap On Last Years Market Action:*** SPY closed down 19.48%* QQQ closed down 33.07%* Dow Jones Industrial closed down 8.78%* VIX closed up 25.86%Good evening and happy new year everyone. I hope that you all have had a great start to this year and are excited for all the new opportunities that may present themselves. Last year the markets really took a hit, especially FAANG and other big tech stocks. Interestingly, value stocks such as those that are included in the Dow have fared relatively well with the Dow only closing down around 9% for the year. There is still a considerable amount of uncertainty in the markets as the VIX still remain elevated. However, looking forward there are still several stocks that are setting up for potentially money making moves.https://preview.redd.it/m9nnpgidxp9a1.png?width=2235&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1b362e1a63fb2489aa7b56a0bad0f69785e3c785APA is an oil and gas company that is currently siting 10% off of its 52 week high. Sales and EPS are both way up year over year and the current price is above all of the moving averages. If we see a good push through $48.60 with an increase in volume this could be a good position to open.https://preview.redd.it/w6cofo1exp9a1.png?width=2259&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1e1c19fdbb91fa3f9ec94f817a15866c2cc8807CPRX (Catalyst Pharmaceuticals)is a biotechnology company that has been trending upward for the past few months and is currently close to all time highs. During the last trading day price gapped down but recovered to the 8 day [EMA](https://everydaytrades.com/moving-averages/) (red line). This would be a pull back setup which is typically riskier than a base breakout or cup and handle. If we see price push above the 8 day [EMA](https://everydaytrades.com/moving-averages/) as well as the wicks from the previous days with heavy volume this could be a good place to open a position. There is also 3.2 days of short interest with could play a factor if the short positions have to cover and thus cause an increase in buying volume.https://preview.redd.it/l8q6v0oexp9a1.png?width=2266&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78b248936299598c17de447595051d99359962eeCVX (Chevron) is also an oil and gas company that is forming a cup and handle pattern. CVX has had increasing sales and EPS year over year. The top of the handle at $180.30 would be the buy point if you choose to open a position.https://preview.redd.it/0y4mcm6fxp9a1.png?width=2257&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=613262fcfd82b881bb2acb467d87caf5fe43d6dbSLB (Schlumberger) is forming a bas with a trigger point of $54.20. The sales and EPS are increasing year over year and there is also 1.6 days of short interest. While this is not a significant amount of short interest it is relevant as this stock is approach new multi year highs. The trading volume is also decreasing which may be signaling that there are not many sellers left.**Bringing everything together:**While this new year still has many uncertainties left to be resolved, there are still several companies that are poised to break out if the conditions are met.

"It comes down to this-I grew up in a slightly upper middle class household. I worked during summers my teenage years, but my parents were able to pay for college. We weren't rich, but my boomer parents will be leaving me about 2MM in assets which is fantastic, but I'm just saying I'm not a Rockefeller or anything... **I do have to work if I want a family**. So I went to a pretty good college, got a job afterwards, and after 6 years I was making about 140k in Los Angeles which is nothing, half of that goes to rent and alcohol.However, between 2017 and 2021, I struck it big with Tesla, ""coins"" (I believe you can't mention that name here"", and basically turned 60k into 1.5MM post tax. It was fucking insane. I quite my job to just live it up.Again, I grew up in a decent financial environment. We went out to nice restaurants once or twice a month, and took a yearly vacation to some pretty nice places... but after my wins in ""investing"" I was traveling 6 months out of the year and eating $150+ meals whenever I wanted. Literally I would wake up at 3pm and order $150 bucks of amazing sushi and have it delivered to my door. Those were the best times.I'm fucking poor again though. I invested wisely into a rental property, but I lost like 600k last year on stupid YOLOs and general downturn, and am now kind of broke again. I'm actually like fucking poor, I only get 3k/month from rent and that's all I have besides like 30k in Tesla shares.The problem is that the **illusion has been shattered for me**. I have caught a glimpse of life outside wageslaving and I literally cannot go back. It's fucking horse shit that some wallstreet bro can click a button and make 400k in 1 week, which would take someone 30 years of burger flipping to save up.You laugh, but all work is work. Burger flipping isn't an easy job and someone's gotta do it. Even a surgeon needs to save up for like 5 years to save up 400k, whereas MONEY PEOPLE have returns so absurd that normal people would puke if they understood.And now I understand. You ask how these finance people can behave in such shitty ways, legally stealing money from everyone, not working but making thousands of times more money than the average white collar worker, let alone blue collar. Once you have had a taste of this life, you cannot go back. You can't go back to some asinine cubicle job, pushing paper, taking shit from regarded coworkers, with no outlet for your rage since you're afraid of getting fired, eventually developing cancer from decades of internalizing your anger...no, once you've seen it, there's no going back. That's why these finance guys are such cutthroat psychopaths... they also don't want to work. No one wants to fucking work, but they found the real path to not working.And now, after this bullrun, I suspect there are many people like me, who instead of being productive members of society are now just looking for ways to make bank again without working.

"As we all know this stock is down but I don’t think it’s over yet boys. Interest rates are still high, no one has money for a used car that cost the same as a brand new one off the lot. These guys overpaid all of their vehicles for the past 2 years ( look it up) they were buying used cars at MSRP or MORE. Why would you say? Well cars were scarce due to chip shortage the past year which drove used car prices SKY HIGH that’s a thing of the past. I work in the car manufacture transport business. We have been working non stop getting vehicles to dealerships. Atleast 2000 vehicles a day ( South California ) it doesn’t sound like a lot but we have establishments all across the country. All working 12 hours per shift. More brand new cars to dealerships = less cars being sold at Carvana. If they actually want to make a sale they’re going to have to cut their prices which is still no good since they overpaid for their inventory.  Earnings is coming up 02/23 they have being missing earnings every QTR. I don’t see this changing till they go bankrupt.

"I know roll your eyes, this is another Gold Bug who's been clamoring for Gold since the 1800s something something about fiat currencies and doomsday stuff and hiding in a bunker .. and my papa was a 49er... ACTUALLY NO!  I only hopped in gold at the end of 2022, because I see commodities (personally gold) and volatility selling strategies as the best performing asset class in 2023 AGAIN.  And because I'm so bullish on gold outperforming other asset classes, that I'm actually hoping to get some counter arguments from the big brained folks here before I max my credit to buy gold.# Ok!As you all know, while every asset class like stocks, bonds, etc... even gov treasuries crashed this year (believe it or not, your super duper safe haven super safe US treasury ETF $TLT fell 30% this year - so much for safety amirite), gold and many other commodities maintained it's value and even so in a RISING RATE environment 😮.  Although 2023 probably won't be as bad as 2022, I still see gold outperforming other asset classes for mostly the same reason it did in 2022.**Why did gold outperform in 2022**?1. Gold showed that once again it's a place where you can **really store value**.  Remember all the hype of Cryptos and all the TikTok stars clamoring cryptos are a store of value and inflation hedge and yada yada??  How's that correlation with the overall stock market work out?  How's boys like SBF and the lack of regulation work out in building investor confidence?  You think institutions will still maintain confidence in it and market it to their clients?  How's hypemen like Tom Brady and Matt Damon do for investor confidence as well?  While I believe in block chain tech, let's be honest, we are probably gonna have a winter for a bit because there isn't stimmies flowing out left and right, and let's be honest, a lot of people - the later bandwagoners, probably lost a bunch of money getting into it thinking it's a store of value and valid currency and not as a speculative asset, so probably have a bad taste in their mouths.  Oh! And mining bitcoin is bad for the environment.  You can't live in the West and be pro bitcoin or you are bad heartless person: [https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/eu-will-likely-ban-bitcoin-to-no-avail](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/eu-will-likely-ban-bitcoin-to-no-avail) , just like you can't be pro fossil fuels, pro meat consumption, etc... all bad people stuff.  So it's time to get with the times and be anti-cryptos as well or eventually you are a bad person too.  And you don't want to be a bad person otherwise you end up like Putin.  Cryptos soon won't be ""vogue"" anymore when the next gen of kids get brainwashed because cryptos kill polar bears.  The powers that be are already setting this in motion.  Don't be that boomer in the next gen's eyes...2. Gold maintained it's value in 2022 not only because it's an inflation hedge, but also of **central bank buying**.  [https://www.ft.com/content/e0983ebb-bbe0-4d33-8517-e19fa06e1a77](https://www.ft.com/content/e0983ebb-bbe0-4d33-8517-e19fa06e1a77). I'll get into more why this is the case and why I think it will continue next.**Why gold should continue to perform well in 2023**?Too many reasons!1. **Continued central bank buying**:  When war in Ukraine broke out, the West froze Russia's USD assets. [https://www.nbcnews.com/data-graphics/russian-bank-foreign-reserve-billions-frozen-sanctions-n1292153](https://www.nbcnews.com/data-graphics/russian-bank-foreign-reserve-billions-frozen-sanctions-n1292153)  Any country, that currently aren't simps for the West (China, Russia, India, Middle East, Turkey, South America, etc...) have immediately taken note of this unprecedented action by the west.  If they want to do ANYTHING that may be considered naughty naughty 🤭 🤫by the west, they could get their USD assets frozen.  Hence, the frenzy in all of these countries in trying to diversify their reserves away from USD into something else - which one of the new assets they are buying, besides something like the Yuan, is Gold: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-30/russia-to-raise-yuan-share-in-wealth-fund-to-60-gold-to-40?leadSource=uverify%20wall](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-30/russia-to-raise-yuan-share-in-wealth-fund-to-60-gold-to-40?leadSource=uverify%20wall)  I see this trend to continue from now until de-globalization reverses, which could be quite a while.  This should prop up gold and other commodity prices.  The US is losing it's grip/influence in a lot of spaces in the world that's not the EU.  Saudi Arabia as an example.2. **Reaching the terminal rates** :  Often times when rates rise, gold falls.  Yet, rates have risen by so much in 2022 yet gold has maintained it's price.  With the Fed supposedly reaching the end of the rate hikes and inflation supposedly peaking, this catalyst to decrease gold prices will eventually come off the table. 3. **Persistent Inflation**: While inflation is coming down, I truly do believe that the Fed will never hit it's target of 2% inflation, without completely destroying demand and causing the country to enter a deep and tough recession.  I don't see the Fed willing to raise rates so much to do that, partly because of political pressure and partly because that just creates even more issues.  As a reuslt, both demand and supply side dynamics will continue to keep inflation above 2%   1. **Supply Side Inflation Continues**: Everyone keeps on saying supply side inflation is ""transitory"" is the same dummies that said inflation is ""transitory"".  If the west really wanted to reduce supply side inflation, they would stop fueling the war in Ukraine.  They would stop being anti fossil fuel and anti a lot of things.  That's not ending any time soon, so supply side inflation won't stop.  Additionally, given how the west is so afraid of covid, we could once again see supply side inflation if China unleashes their population to infect the world again, leading to supply chain issues.   2. **Demand Side Inflation Continues**: Given that the Fed probably won't bring us to a deep and serious recesssion with unemployment spiking over 10% and really crushing the demand side of things, demand will never drop low enough for inflatoin to reach 2%. Additionally, the west likes to fight inflation by handing out more money.  While the Fed can stop printing, like it's been doing, goverments themselves can continue to spend with money they don't have.  California is giving out money to fight inflation: [https://www.kcra.com/article/california-inflation-relief-payments-timeframe-update-1672447464/42371519](https://www.kcra.com/article/california-inflation-relief-payments-timeframe-update-1672447464/42371519).  Same with Spain [https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/spain-announces-106-bln-package-ease-inflation-pain-2023-2022-12-27/](https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/spain-announces-106-bln-package-ease-inflation-pain-2023-2022-12-27/).  Politicians live for votes, so they will never be aligned with the central bank.  Like any good corporation, they care about lining their pockets now, not necessarily do what's best.  Y**ou and I like free money, so we will never say no when a politician promises us free money for votes.  There's no end to it**.   3. **TLDR**: Western govs like to induce inflation via their policies such as anti fossile fuel, extending the war in Ukraine, locking stuff down, etc... while handing out stimmies for votes.  The central bank must fight against all that but they can only do so much without causing a real legit recession.   4. Example: Sellers used to sell 100 widgts and buyers bought 100 widgets.  Now only 50 widgets are availalbe due to supply constraints so the price goes up.  Only 50 widgets are now sold and some people can't afford them so they miss out.  Gov hands out stimmies so now more people can afford the 50 available widgest, so it goes up further in price.4. **Changing Fed Inflation Target**: If the Fed can't get inflation down to 2%, that will unleash another wave of lack of confidence in the USD and fed, causing real assets to go up again.  And the Fed is already laying the groundwork for this when it realizes in 2-3 years that it can't reach it's 2% goal without causing a real and deep recession.  No one wants to go in depth yet on this stark reality, but the Fed stated in it's most recent meeting that: ""**there may be a longer-run project"" that could take a fresh look at the central bank's inflation goal**. "" [https://money.usnews.com/investing/news/articles/2022-12-14/powell-says-fed-will-not-change-2-inflation-goal](https://money.usnews.com/investing/news/articles/2022-12-14/powell-says-fed-will-not-change-2-inflation-goal).  Some managers are already making this claim - the Fed just has not admit it: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-14/bill-ackman-says-fed-s-2-inflation-target-no-longer-credible?leadSource=uverify%20wall](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-14/bill-ackman-says-fed-s-2-inflation-target-no-longer-credible?leadSource=uverify%20wall).  Wait for the Fed to admit it and see what happens to commodities...5. **Debt Ceiling Volatility**: 2023 marks a year where we may have another debt ceiling crisis.  While Reps are not as fiscally conservative as they used to be, they are still 1000% more conservative than Dems these days.  If inflation is still a hot topic, they may be able to rally around being more fiscally conservative, causing a deadlock as they control the House.  Some pundits are saying that this debt ceiling crisis could be as volatilie as the one in 2011 and 1995.  In both of those situations, gold prices popped, i personally have it going up 10% in 1995 and 20% in 2011.  While this is a small move in % terms, with the low implied volatility on gold options, it's a pretty big move within a few months.

This scneario is more of a pipe dream that gold bulls like to push and is not covered by main stream media, aka it's more on the conspiracy side of things...but it's not impossible if Putin truly becomes desperate.

Most people say fed pivot in 2H 2023, I say 2024-2025.  With that said, the financing market is very tight and MANY of your favorite negative income stocks are going to run out of cash in the next year, likely leading to higher unemployment.  If the Fed were to pivot, and start printing money again, well that'll only lead to an increase in gold prices...again!

"I know roll your eyes, this is another Gold Bug who's been clamoring for Gold since the 1800s something something about fiat currencies and doomsday stuff and hiding in a bunker .. and my papa was a 49er... ACTUALLY NO!  I only hopped in gold at the end of 2022, because I see commodities (personally gold) and volatility selling strategies as the best performing asset class in 2023 AGAIN.  And because I'm so bullish on gold outperforming other asset classes, that I'm actually hoping to get some counter arguments from the big brained folks here before I max my credit to buy gold.# Ok!As you all know, while every asset class like stocks, bonds, etc... even gov treasuries crashed this year (believe it or not, your super duper safe haven super safe US treasury ETF $TLT fell 30% this year - so much for safety amirite), gold and many other commodities maintained it's value and even so in a RISING RATE environment 😮.  Although 2023 probably won't be as bad as 2022, I still see gold outperforming other asset classes for mostly the same reason it did in 2022.**Why did gold outperform in 2022**?1. Gold showed that once again it's a place where you can really store value.  Remember all the hype of Cryptos and all the TikTok stars clamoring cryptos are a store of value and inflation hedge and yada yada??  How's that correlation with the overall stock market work out?  How's boys like SBF and the lack of regulation work out in building investor confidence?  You think institutions will still maintain confidence in it?  How's hypemen like Tom Brady and Matt Damon do for investor confidence as well?  While I believe in block chain tech, let's be honest, we are probably gonna have a winter for a bit because there isn't stimmies flowing out left and right, and let's be honest, a lot of people - the later bandwagoners, probably lost a bunch of money getting into it thinking it's a store of value and valid currency and not as a speculative asset, so probably have a bad taste in their mouths.  Oh! And mining bitcoin is bad for the environment.  You can't live in the West and be pro bitcoin or you are bad heartless person: [https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/eu-will-likely-ban-bitcoin-to-no-avail](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/eu-will-likely-ban-bitcoin-to-no-avail) , just like you can't be pro fossil fuels, pro meat consumption, etc... all bad people stuff.  So it's time to get with the times and be anti-cryptos as well or eventually you are a bad person too.  And you don't want to be a bad person otherwise you end up like Putin.  Cryptos soon won't be ""vogue"" anymore when the next gen of kids get brainwashed because cryptos kill polar bears.2. Gold maintained it's value in 2022 not only because it's an inflation hedge, but also of central bank buying.

"Hello. It is I, Jupiter, the biggest b\*tch in the solar system. Some of you may have no idea who I am. Some of you may loathe me. Very few of you like me. Regardless, you will agree that if you have some opinion about me we likely go back. Which is what brings me here. You're quitting. I get it. This last year has been shitty and you lost money on plays that I myself likely would have followed. For the most part, it makes no sense. We can say we're following such and such year, adjust charts, follow china gdp lag and just play that, use ict, master ict, pay for premium fintwits, hack all the premium fintwits and get them for free, befriend troll looking quants who give you algos and still lose. I know. I've done all those things. I blew up my options account a few months ago and vowed to not reload it and had to resort doing futes only on the computer only and making myself take profit daily. It's not fun anymore. It's not a game. You can't just long and win. You can't even short and win. It's a job, and you have to be good at it to making money right now. And it takes up a lot of f\*cking time. So I get it. I totally get that you're quitting. But here's the thing. I feel like some of us grew up on the internet together. And one by one as we watch ogs slowly disappear I just want to say while you're still here, I'm gonna miss you. Thank you for the laughs. Thank you for the insults about my hands, my genitalia, and my penchant for starting shit with the winkers. Thank you for the karma, the drama, and the tea. Thank you for the flair, the respect and disrespect of my opinions. You all have a special place in my internet heart, and I wish you well in your endeavors.

"The 20 day moving average is a technical indicator that is calculated by averaging the closing prices of a security over the past 20 days. It is used to smooth out price fluctuations and provide a clearer picture of the underlying trend. Traders may use the 20 day moving average as a buy or sell signal, depending on the direction of the average and the price action of the security. For example, if the price of a security is above its 20 day moving average and the average is trending upwards, this may be seen as a buy signal. Conversely, if the price is below the average and the average is trending downwards, this may be seen as a sell signal. It is important to note that moving averages should not be used in isolation and should be used in conjunction with other technical indicators and fundamental analysis.Here are a few more details about how the 20 day moving average can be used in trading:Crossover signals: One way to use the 20 day moving average is to look for crossover signals, where the price of the security crosses above or below the average. If the price crosses above the average, it may be seen as a bullish signal and a potential buying opportunity. If the price crosses below the average, it may be seen as a bearish signal and a potential selling opportunity.Support and resistance: The 20 day moving average can also act as a level of support or resistance for the price of the security. If the price is trending upwards and the 20 day moving average is flat or trending upwards, the average may act as a level of support, meaning that the price may have a hard time falling below it. Similarly, if the price is trending downwards and the average is flat or trending downwards, the average may act as a level of resistance, meaning that the price may have a hard time rising above it.Trend confirmation: In addition to providing buy and sell signals, the 20 day moving average can also be used to confirm the direction of the trend. If the average is trending upwards and the price is also trending upwards, this may be seen as a confirmation of an uptrend. If the average is trending downwards and the price is also trending downwards, this may be seen as a confirmation of a downtrend.It's important to keep in mind that the 20 day moving average is just one tool among many that traders can use to make decisions. It's always a good idea to use a variety of indicators and techniques in order to get a more complete picture of the market.Be sure to follow me at my substack for other great tipshttps://barrywentworth.substack.com/p/how-to-use-the-20-day-moving-average",How To Use The 20 Day Moving Average To Improve Your Trading Performance,1,self.wallstreetbets,1014414,Fundshat,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1014414/how_to_use_the_20_day_moving_average_to_improve/,1672636441,2603,72,13,460,0.015,0.913,0.072,0.975,0.0,0.805,0.195,0.4404

"It seems rather strange to ask this question on a margins infested sub. I love you all.  It is also rather obvious that *debt* is generally a bad thing and when unctrolled, it is a monster. The balance of political spectrum in our western society  makes the concept rather perplexing, and quiet interesting. We may not have the perfect system, but democracy and capitalism has always the better alternative. In fact the lack of better alternative is factual.* in modern human history there has never been a proven better working system*. Not socialism, fascism, imperialism, monarchies etc. have ever produced the amount of progress that modern western democracies and capitalism  have ever achieved.  In fact China still uses forms of Capitalsim to advance.*The perfect balance  in a political spectrum*While the left enables the stimulus of economies to advance by spending, the right is able to disable the the switch when we start to over spend.  *Checks and balances at its finest*You do not want the world to keep thinking  that the USD( currently the global reserve currency)  is printed recklessly, the right does a great job at  hammering down. But you also  want to inject a stimulus into an economy avoiding collapses the left does a great job at doing so through spending.The debate should not be, in my useless opinion about more.or less spending. The debate should rather be focused on the type of spending, where is the money allocated. As long as America remains the world global reserve currency ( and you need it to be so for your portfolio not to collapse  )It must continue its path towards the advancement of societies and try to minimize human suffering. Now you are  likely to laugh at this, but,  the poorest person today is better off in comparison to  poorest person just about 150 years ago by a wide margin in context to all of human society put together.  And this is largely due to America's Hegenomy. From the first humans to just about  say 200 years ago, human advancement is at a steady rising slope, untill America, where the slope is rising at incredible rate ( elcriticy, banking , technology,  medicine, spacs ) Now I know you are thinking of China.Ray Dalios principles of a world changing order is quiet amazing, and accurate but not entirely. After years of advancement and economic growth the Emerging superpower overtakes the rotted corrupt bloated lazy current superpower through a major war. The problem is the following: throghout history the merging superpower always ends up winning some sort of war. The problem with today is : Nuclear weapons.

I will look forward to your questions.***Despite the slowdown in growth, the labor market remains extremely tight, with the unemployment rate near a 50-year low, job vacancies still very high, and wage growth elevated. Job gains have been robust, with employment rising by an average of 272,000 jobs per month over the last three months. Although job vacancies have moved below their highs and the pace of job gains has slowed from earlier in the year, the labor market continues to be out of balance, with demand substantially exceeding the supply of available workers. The labor force participation rate is little changed since the beginning of the year. FOMC participants expect supply and demand conditions in the labor market to come into better balance over time, easing upward pressures on wages and prices. The median projection in the SEP for the unemployment rate rises to 4.6 percent at the end of next year.*That being said : On January 6th **In 2023, the full Moon rises on January 6** Traditionally, this full Moon was called the “Wolf Moon,” appearing when wolves howled outside the villages in hunger.

"Hello, And because timing the market perfectly is nearly impossible, the best strategy for most of us is not to try to market-time at allNew low? February? March ? Bare with me, I know I will be given a bunch of ""what if"" in this post. This is because truly this whole market is but what ifs...unless we back test like algorithmic traders, even then they fail.Because of the amount certainty from analysts and news outlets  that we are due for a recession and markets are going to sh*t,  it is almost impossible not to question the validty of such predictions. *Could it be possible that everyone will be correct in 2023 ?* yes to both bears and bulls...On both sides at the end they may say .... I told you so.How ? Simply put: Economic Data and Sentiment. For the first half of 2022, the economic data suggested we are in deep sh*t.  While the second half shows there might be hope.The sentiment at the end of 2022 is that 2023 we are going to hell.What if  the market doesn't give a sh*t about your feelings. Lets say CPI comes in way better then expected ? What if inflation  is reduced again What if unemployment rising perfect to the point feds go down to .25 or even 0Any of those will shake the ground you walk on. And voila the S&amp;P rages to new highs, then quickly analysts  pound the tables and suggest the market is much to overbought, etc etc. Boom !!!  sell off.Back to the bottom.. then the story repeats itself.What if simply, we hit a new high/low followed by a new low/high Making 2023 neither a crash neither a bull run.

"So, I'm broke, living with an old coworker, and working at a cellphone store making minimum plus commission (and also happen to be in the slowest store in the district). I'm wanting to get into the numbers game to hopefully find financial independence and actually make some ground instead of barely staying afloat. I have cash app and have been toying with the in app bitcoin buy and sell as well as the in app stock market, but it all seems too confusing out the gate and the guides are hard to understand. So my question is how exactly do I go about starting a financial portfolio and make profits off of stocks and other passive methods while I squander my life at a corporate hellscape.

"I have been trading since 2006 and have never seen one side so sure the market is going to crash even more after one of the worst years ever.I follow 12 trading “experts” that I feel are best-in-class and they all see the market still not bottoming until March/April 23’.Almost every “wall street expert” is predicting the market to go lower.Morgan Stanley can’t keep saying it enough that the market is going to 3,300.Puts are at an all time high, literally, everyone is betting on the same thing to happen. I don’t know anyone who has a significant call option for the market to be higher in Q1 of next year.The thing is about this, is that it’s not like people are waiting on the market to finally fall, it’s been violently falling for an entire year. So much that traders have no faith in stocks anymore as seen with the options chains - and no one wants to touch risk on plays. What’s the more likely scenario?- Everyone is right, history repeats itself, except this time everyone is prepared and makes a ton of money off the next leg down on the most crowded trade of the century Or- Everyone has no clue what will happen. They just expect history to repeat itself and believe that the banks and Wall Street are trying to warn everyone of a market crash because they only have retails best interest in mind and care about you. In this case, the market does what it does best - shakes out the crowded trade until everyone believes the market is going to recover before pulling the rug once put volume comes way down.TLDR: What’s your thought on the most crowded trade of the century? Is the market going to reward everyone and the next leg down is coming in Q1 23’ - or does crashing inflation hold the market up until put holders are exhausted and only starts the next leg down when everyone lease expects it?",Is being bearish right now the most one-sided trade ever?,1,self.wallstreetbets,100tndp,tdogger88,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/100tndp/is_being_bearish_right_now_the_most_onesided/,1672607692,1815,57,10,333,0.082,0.834,0.084,0.5749,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

"I am a 17 year old budding Financial analysis looking for some advice from someone who has taken the road of Investment banking. I have managed my own portfolio for 3 years and 2 months now with a return of 22% on a total of 43 trades. I have recently moved to solely options in the past 11 months. on the 21st will be a full year with the account netting a profit of 43%. I am psychopathic when it comes to money and stocks as I have realized my potential. I have adopted this crazy money driven mindset in the past year where all I think about is money and dedicate about 6 hrs a day to the market. I don't value school as I am a junior and the only class I take that I value is my AP Econ class. I have a 50 year personalized flow chart till I plan to retire at about 65. I caddie at a very prestigious golf club where I interact with very many high profile individuals and have two possible internships lined up this summer because of people I have met and connections I have made (I caddie literally 1-2 times every single day in the summer). It sounds crazy but I have everything planned down to the year. I have very many possibilities in the sector though. I feel I will most likely go to college for Finance, hop around a bit with a firm, until I eventually start my own hedge fund (it will happen). I believe the connections I have made and will continue to make will provide very generous seed funding for my plan and I believe as I have only known trading in the bear market, I will succeed even more in the bull. If anyone out there has a similar mindset, experience, and can give me any advice on what you did or what happened to you I would greatly appreciate it. I will also note that I am the 2022 Huntington stock market champion (out of over 5000 teenagers) and am leading this years competition with a current portfolio value of $155,000 while 2nd place is $120,000 as an appeal to credibility.

"As we enter the new year of 2023, it's natural to feel a sense of uncertainty about the future of the stock market. However, it's important to remember that the stock market has always been and will continue to be a source of long-term growth for investors. While there may be ups and downs in the short-term, the overall trend of the stock market has been upward over the long run.There are several reasons to be optimistic about the stock market in 2023. Firstly, the global economy is showing signs of recovery after the challenges of the past few years. This is good news for companies, as a strong economy typically leads to strong corporate profits. When companies are profitable, their stock prices tend to rise, which is good news for investors.Secondly, the rollout of vaccines for COVID-19 is providing a much-needed boost to the economy. As more and more people are vaccinated, restrictions on businesses and travel are being lifted, leading to increased consumer spending and economic activity. This bodes well for the stock market, as companies stand to benefit from the increased demand for their products and services.In addition, the Federal Reserve has indicated that it plans to continue supporting the economy by keeping interest rates low. Low interest rates make it cheaper for companies to borrow money, which can be used to invest in growth. This can lead to increased stock prices for these companies.Finally, it's important to remember that the stock market is a forward-looking indicator. This means that it reflects investors' expectations for the future, rather than just current economic conditions. With the economy showing signs of recovery and the rollout of vaccines providing a path out of the pandemic, it's reasonable to expect that investors will have a more optimistic outlook on the future.In summary, while there will always be risks and uncertainties in the stock market, there are several reasons to be optimistic about the market in 2023. A recovering global economy, the rollout of vaccines, and supportive monetary policy are all factors that point to potential growth in the stock market this year. As always, it's important to diversify your portfolio and consult with a financial advisor to make informed investment decisions.","2023 market prediction, what you guys think?",1,self.wallstreetbets,100over,StashedGold,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/100over/2023_market_prediction_what_you_guys_think/,1672595309,2274,44,7,370,0.031,0.804,0.165,0.9935,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

im new here. I’m also am too cool for rules 😎with the rising cost of interest/liquidity i decided to look into corporate bonds that will need to be refinanced in the next two years. AAPL has two loans/bonds that expire in 2023 (one for 5.5b and another for idk look it up) this is clearly not financial advice but it does seem that when the loans expire AAPL will need to either use the cash on hand to pay off the debt or refinance at todays interest rates which would eat into their margin for years forward. this is a hypothesis and i likely will not act on it myself. i am new to investing but old to finance and do not have any experience surrounding how loans due in high interest rate environments effects the overall equity value per share when they uh refinance or use COHneway that’s how i think about this stuff.  numbers are the bees knees. feel free to ban if there’s some kinda magical format that appeases the mod gods or if i’ve someone offended AAPL fans or if you just feel like it. i feel lucky 🍀 HAPPY NEE YEARS!,AAPL DD,1,self.wallstreetbets,100om6h,travis_moor,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/100om6h/aapl_dd/,1672594617,1032,7,2,197,0.059,0.757,0.184,0.9841,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

"I can't believe I'm not seeing more about this stock on here.  First, the requirements: not financial advice, the last 3 years have shown me I have litteraly NO clue what I'm doing.That having been said, this stock has been sitting between $5 and $6 a share forever.  MDGL posts good data on their NASH drug, and VKTX pops past $9.  Here's my opinion.   NASH is a big scene and from the trial data I've read, it LOOKS like VKTX has a better drug.  Not just that but applications beyond just NASH like weightloss (another big sector) plus a pipeline of 5 other drugs in niche but undeserved areas.  On top of that, a 5 year cash runway.  YES, they are suing a Chinese company for theft of their molecule - which tells me the molecule is WORTH stealing!  And if proven, that other company - even if they manage to bring it to market - will get frozen out of American markets.  Short interest is 1.8 M of a 3 M volume and 2.8 % of float.  Plus out of 9 analysts, it shows a low 12 month of $11, mid at $18, and a high of $30 projected.Isn't this exactly the kind of situation that makes WSB wish they wore their white pants???",VKTX still has room,1,self.wallstreetbets,100mj6y,SeaworthinessLost459,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/100mj6y/vktx_still_has_room/,1672588785,1123,19,4,226,0.056,0.812,0.132,0.9419,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Has this company completely tanked? My app won’t even give me numbers at this point. I don’t mind the loss since is was a small amount and I saw it as a fun way to learn.

Anyways yeah, game plan on Tuesday is to go all in on $BAC stonk and buy as many shares as possible, also the stock bounced off resistance recently and just looks like it's going to go higher and break the 200 day moving average, earning have also been ight, that's about it tbh, uh what else, oh yeah I'm not a financial advisor. My price target is $34.5, a roughly 4% return from the current $33.18 per share price. I expect this price target to be hit within 1-2 weeks, stop loss will be at $32 per share or roughly a -3.5% decrease from the current price. If you have a big boy account just buy shares, if you want to leverage and go with options I recommend buy the  **BAC $34 Call 1/27/2023** option. Keep in mind the only thing that could ruin this trade is if the S&amp;P 500 decides to crash, I doubt it will, but who knows. As such I'm going to just stick to buying shares with my stop loss, however if I were to go with buying the options I wouldn't buy heavy and I'd be mentally prepared to lose it all or use a -50% stop loss, the call options are pretty cheap right now.

I was experimenting with options this year and discovered that I am a gay bear.  Most profitable for me were put options with monthly expiration.  Biggest wins were puts on companies with triple digit P/E ratio like AMZN, CRM and RBLX.  Biggest loss -80% on HUT shares.  I try to stay away from short term options lottery tickets.  I try to keep position size small since I’m old and have no luxury of going back to work at Wendy's to recover my portfolio.  I do not trade every day and only enter when there is a good chance to win.  I currently have 4k shares of JWN and 40 puts on NKE, rest in cash.

"6 months ago, I made this bold post named Bull Case for China. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vtotgm/dd\_bull\_case\_for\_china/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vtotgm/dd_bull_case_for_china/)The day after I published the post, CSI 300 (ASHR) &amp; BABA, took a dive 3% and 9% respectively. From there, it was an extremely painful 2 months, as my pair trade of long Chinese and short US equities backfired spectacularly with SPY rising 12% in 1 month while ASHR and BABA went down 8% and 15% respectively.Currently things are looking better, with short positions on SPY and QQQ more than offset losses from going long on Chinese equities.I'm still bullish on Chinese equities:\- China reopened, retail sale data for January / February should be interesting to watch and can be a huge catalyst. It is always the darkest before the dawn.  \- Real estate developers stabilized with greater access to credit, however this should put a downward pressure on house prices as more inventory gets delivered, putting a damper on consumer sentiment.  \- Dovish central bank is set to lower rates again next year with even looser financing conditions.  \- Even though Xi crowned himself king, government repeatedly signalled support for private enterprises and there's no u-turns from its previous directions.  \- Short positions / negative sentiment on ASHR has been decreasing (below is the amount shares lent short from my account)https://preview.redd.it/drncfbcj6a9a1.png?width=951&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e19d2332df35155437d7e594fabe9bd83da100cI'm still negative on U.S. equities:\- Fed will hold rate constant @ \~ 5%, unless something truly breaks, rate will hold there for a long time until QT drains all the excess cash from the system, which could take 1 - 2 years. With ample reserve policy, it will be hard for something to truly break since there's always ample liquidity.  \- BOJ ""raised"" 10 year interest rate from 0.25% to 0.4-0.5%, and with inflation hitting Japan domestically, its highly likely BOJ will abandon their YCC policy next year, which will put upward pressure on bond yields across the world.  \- Assuming current 4  - 5% interest to continue for 1 - 2 years, and there's no meaningful growth in earnings, US equities (especially QQQ @ 25 P/E) are not attractive compare to short term bonds.Current positions:https://preview.redd.it/8md14x5v6a9a1.png?width=1178&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=548dec96030cfba06f319cef4fcde041e7dd9958",Year in review and bull case for China pt. 2,1,self.wallstreetbets,10013kn,zhumxc123,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/10013kn/year_in_review_and_bull_case_for_china_pt_2/,1672513318,2504,44,10,359,0.091,0.793,0.116,0.8566,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

"First off, I am aware that NVDA literally got cut in half YTD.So, on average, shorting it throughout 2022 has been a massively profitable undertaking and ""the time to buy puts was exactly 1 year ago"".With those snarky comments out of the way, NVDA is still sitting on a PE of ~62 and forward PE of ~38.That seems way too high in the current macroeconomic environment.* Fed isn't done raising rates yet. We are yet to reach the terminal rate and they have been clear in wanting to keep it there for a while.* Rates take some time to work through the real economy. I do think we haven't seen the pain JPOW spike of, at least in the real economy.* There's been real and heavy gamer backlash against the 4000 series GPUs when prices where revealed. Gamers genuinely think NVDA has lost the plot and think they can charge whichever price.* Coupled with the end of GPU crypto mining, the market is flooded with cheap and still very high performance 3000 series GPUs, not generating any revenue for NVDA.* Their GPUs are used for state of the art AI projects in other companies. I'm far from an expert but those are expensive projects and could easily be perceived as ""not  essential in these trying times"" making said companies pause these projects, reducing yet again demand for NVDA's GPUs.As I said, yes the stock has lost 50% in 2022 so some of the above has definitely been priced in.**What is going to drive demand for their products in such a way that they meet revenue and EPS targets? Let alone allow them to give upbeat guidance?** ***Positions***: none so far, thinking about throwing a few grand into longer dated puts.Calling all devil advocates to come up with a bullish reasoning to spark discussion and gauge if the ship has sailed for this dumb gamble or the bearish reasoning does hold merit and is an educated guess that should net profits.Have a great NY and may our portfolios be green in 2023.",Is there any bullish argument left for NVDA going into 2023?,1,self.wallstreetbets,zzxqzs,Schwimmbo,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/zzxqzs/is_there_any_bullish_argument_left_for_nvda_going/,1672504039,1909,60,11,342,0.064,0.841,0.096,0.8933,0.2,0.8,0.0,-0.3612

" As a dividend-growth investor, I'm always looking for better ways to evaluate the investment quality of a stock individually as well as part of my broader portfolio. In the very beginning I used to heavily invest in stocks that were Dividend Aristocrats. But I started asking questions such as, how are these stocks performing compared to their peers. Are there stocks with better performing ROEs? What level of risk (Sharpe ratio) was taken to achieve those earnings? What is the forecasted earnings growth over the next 5 years? How many consecutive years have they increased dividends? What's their payout ratio? What are analysts thinking? Are there sectors/industries I'm overinvested or underinvested in?So I decided to write some programs to pull free financial data from multiple sources. I consolidate all of these different data sources, cleanse and standardize the data, and came up with my own scoring metric on how to rank each stock. It does lean more towards small cap stocks which I typically avoid, but it's still informative to know what ranks high. The metrics I use for calculating my score include metrics such as Current Dividend Yield, 5-yr Forecasted Earnings Growth, ROE, Payout Ratio, Sharpe Ratio, Piotroski F Score, Dividend List Membership (Aristocrats, Champions, Kings, etc.) and it favors stocks with strong histories of paying quality dividends. I try not to give any one metric too much weight.Pasted below is a link to a GoogleSheets spreadsheet that has the entire list. Hopefully you can use the data to make more informed investing decisions.[Investment Analysis of 8000+ Stocks](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LW3ANuUQikTQl07I-5GzPpVmaH_YjJNJ/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=106769285082766188452&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true)What are your thoughts on my top rankings? Any surprises? Any questions on any particular metric? Hopefully it has provided you with extra investment insight. I'm always looking for ways to refine my methodology and scoring, so any suggestions would be appreciated.Data Disclaimer: Data from free, publicly available sources are known to have data inaccuracy issues and financial metrics/forecasts are constantly changing everyday, so please independently verify any metric you use when making investment decisions.

"Hey tards, This is just my thought process before the new year, so don't take it too seriously. I may even have an extra chromosome... I'll go from macro to micro or whatever... Globally, swords are drawn. But let's look where we're at. Monetary policy, inflation, and international trade numbers first:**China:** It's up to you to trust data coming out of Pooh Bear's rear side. Inflation around 2%, One year lending rate at 3.65%International Trade Surplus: Around $60 Billion per month**US:**Inflation: Just above 7% Interest rate: 4.5%Trade deficit: Around $70-75 Billion per month**EU**Europoors are just doing Europoor things. Inflation: Around 10%Interest Rate: 2%Trade Deficit: Around $40-45 Billion per month**Japan**Inflation: around 3.5%Interest Rate: 0.5%Trade Deficit: Around $12-13 Billion per monthJapan and EU have had trade deficits since covid which is a reversal to what had been the norm previously. Trade deficits weakened their currency, weak currency increased their deficit due to reliance of imported raw materials and increasing energy prices. So now they have increased their negative rates for the first time - which may be a bit late but we shall see. QE ran its course and now global tightening policies are in effect. But real interest rates are still absurdly negative so there is that and fed believes liquidity in the markets is a good thing so junk bonds can live another day... or whatevs. ECB is tightening a bit more aggressively and actually going to pull some liquidity for the first time since early 2000s. They are starting with something around 300 Billion Euros. Also ECB's minimum reserve mandate is in effect, whereas in the US IIRC there is still no minimum reserve requirement for banks. So what are these telling me? China has no liquidity issues and is still able to push strong export numbers despite covid. EU is struggling and trying to do the right thing which is too naive I think. US is a fucking shitshow; it's still pretty much BRrrrr but with higher nominal interest rates. Japan is holding steady and trying to manage Yen's value only. I don't think we will see a collapse of a market this year. Even as a gay bear, I just don't see it. I can see the collapse of USD at some point before 2030, but I don't see how markets can crash with this much liquidity pumped in to the system. What's concerning is Europoors' honest attempt to do QT right. Where the hell have you been in the last year when inflation got out of hand? Maybe they thought it would just go back to normal as supply chain issues are resolved. Again... how naive. I strongly believe EU will be abolished in the next 2-3 years. Another concerning trend is lack of velocity of money. Money isn't going around in the real economy. It doesn't make as many stops in a month as it used to. Banks are creating too much overhead in the system and are too efficient to collect everything from real economy and pump into finance. It's not just us. It's a whole trend. Every time someone outbids other prospective buyers above asking at a home purchase, every time you decide to finance something beyond your means, every time you ""invest"" instead of spending, money gets sucked up into finance and does not trickle down much. So now we're at our limit. Consumer debt is gonna bite North Americans in the ass. Anyhow... I just cracked another cold one. Recession is already in the room with us. It has been. All this extra juicy M2 is not for nothing. People panicked; Simple as that. Covid hit and people started reevaluating their life choices and sitting at home during lockdowns was an eye opening experience for many. Why do we have to go to the office? Why do we have to work 40 hours and still can't have the basics? Very legitimate questions that got no real answer from those in the government. These are thanks to boomers getting the fuck out of workforce because they already got everything. It finally sank in with them. Wealth gap is at a whole other level now and monkeys want more peanuts. Many industries started downsizing like tech. They will stay lean for a few years at least. So if you're in tech get ready for your new norm. Currently we are rolling back globalization at some level and spreading it on others. For example, supply chain issues made countries realize the importance of building at home rather than relying on imports for essential and strategic goods and services. On the other hand, globally, those that do produce and export, like China, will benefit bigly until they can't.There is a whole restructuring happening and the biggest opportunity is right in front of your eyes. You just gotta decide when is a good time to get in. All these investments to adapt to the NOT new world order will eventually bear fruit. But, let's not forget, globalization occurred due to necessity. Economies of scale allowed lower prices and low margins with high revenues. This is not coming back. In a world separated into new axes, we will have new equilibriums in different markets. Consumer prices were suppressed so much between mid 2000s to 2020. It's only catching up to what it should have been. You're paying so much more for many services, education, homes etc. You think cost of producing most household items or produce stayed the same all this time? Tech improvements and economies of scale allowed that. We ain't got that economies of scale and efficient supply chain no more. The only way this will all make sense is with inflated real estate prices going back to somewhere attainable by working people. Currently working class in North America is being paid piss pour in relation to cost of living in our countries, and being paid a few times more than someone doing the same job in a developing country. They just can't afford to pay you more due to global competition. Distribution of money has always been the biggest flaw and here we are trying to figure it out again...

Tesla has some small advantages such as vertical integration for battery production that easily get cancelled by poor quality design, lack of service network, no alternative for long range vehicles etc…Once battery and charging technology, as well as electrical supply and infrastructure are ready to make pure EV main stream capable, all other automobile manufacturers will have 1:1 competitive cars of which the americans have more experience in heavy duty, the asians have more experience in budget manufacturing and the germans more experience in luxury and quality technology. As we speak today, tesla has no real technology lead if you factor in all dimensions.So back to my original question, why invest into tesla?Maybe because media attention being confused by lamen investors with value?",Confused about tesla investors,1,self.wallstreetbets,zzp5vs,Crazyphilll,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/zzp5vs/confused_about_tesla_investors/,1672474427,1141,30,4,182,0.108,0.777,0.115,0.3595,0.434,0.566,0.0,-0.3182

"What an ABSOULTE WILD year this has been… if you are still here right now and you still have money left in your account… congrats because let me tell you this has been one of the hardest years to trade that many of us in our life times will ever trade. The goal of 2022 was and remained capital preservation if you accomplished that goal… then congrats. The goal of 2023 in my opinion is the same… capital preservation… There is going to someday be another bull market and even if its not a bullmarket… there will someday be another market that is more rational and more obeying of the technicals. Live to trade another day… &amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/a04gijzj349a1.png?width=419&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fac01ab796e7b2bd13d07d560987beb4aea5d9f8here is the new JPM collar btw! &amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/k60hu6hk349a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2e4865329f67183df32d0d5abd22adc53729819I mentioned this pattern yesterday in my TA on SPY. With 378 clearly being “bottom” for the foreseeable future I envision this to be our next pattern to play out. This would give us a rally in January. I would start to eye a retest of 405 to 415 area through the month of January. &amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/lyd00xwk349a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d660be22e451d52ce200aaafb64b44f1c12fcdfbI started to analyze the 2022 bear channel weekly movement. When we take a look at it you can see we have this cycle of peak at channel resistance -&gt; short drop -&gt; short peak -&gt; full dump -&gt; retest of channel resistance. We have been in this pattern all year long. We did however, break through that channel resistance of the 2022 bear channel the day of CPI. However we fell through it and we have not touched it since. &amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/fv3enibl349a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eaa5779e08b3f4ca19bbcc6e3969c038c3c258faTaking a look at the cycle you can we just had a 21 day 8.7% drop for our first short drop… this SHOULD be followed up with about 50-75% of the length and 56% of the distance recovery… so that means we should be looking at about a 10-14 day 4.8% recovery minimum. That would put SPY at the week of 1/16 to 1/20 near 393 minimum. 393 on the weekly timeframe is actually the red bear channels resistance line. That is my target for next week. Taking a look at the structure of the last two weekly candles you can see they are back to back gravestone dojis that came down and bounced off that 376 area and their candle bodies held support at 383 level too. We have been waiting for the 390 resistance retest and I believe that is our target for next week. Key support- 375.6 -&gt; 363.7    key resistance- 390.1 -&gt; 398.8 &amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/a4raa8vl349a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=597005f9e949d32193ba9ba437dfd3c3bee413f1Taking a look at the futures daily chart you can see we are in a massive breakout pattern right here. We did double top off that 3870 key level, however, as you can see we closed out with a massive wick to the downside. With this close this should be seen as a bullish candle for Monday. I would be shocked to not see us breakout over 3870 Tuesday and I will be eyeing a touch of 3910 to 3920. That would be a 1.1 to 1.3% green day on Tuesday.&amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/9litiegm349a1.png?width=694&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e899a916e30a8ff2f93c54808754ec29aafc5beeBesides the June quarterly the last 3 out of 4 quarterlies have opened green. The biggest open was 1.1% at the September quarterly and the lowest is 0.28% for an average of 0.58% green open on the day after quarterly. Something else I had noted for Tuesday DTE options is that the IV closed in the 11s. This is VERY low for SPY IV. Generally almost every morning opens with an IV of 25-30% and slowly ends around 20%. With an IV pump and high probability green open I found a call swing worth the risk for Tuesday. That was also a very bullish finish to the day, week and year. The bears no matter how many times they tried to break us down the last two weeks were not able to. My only hope for 2023 is that we finally get some real direction and that the technicals come back into play better. &amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/9o21nlzm349a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b38e02a1533c39be3d4bb75a7ab01a087ea7c75bI mentioned the inverse head and shoulders on SPY daily and honestly its kinda ugly but I do see it forming here on futures weekly. I could see us reading 4200 by middle of February.As bearish as I want to be and as bearish as I believe the markets tried to be today it just couldn’t do it. The bears do not have the momentum right now to break us down further. &amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/aw7m1won349a1.png?width=1113&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1dd38e615e1a7693b081694a0dbc2332d0df8231A couple important things to note ahead in the month of January. First up on Wednesday (2 days into the new trading year!) we have FOMC minutes (I will have a detailed trade plan posted sometime this weekend for that!)… followed the next day by ADP followed by unemployment rate (The last three have resulted in 1%+/- openings)… And then finally the week after that we have CPI on Thursday January 12th. A big first two weeks of the year. The question is…. Will FOMC minutes remind the market of how bearish JPOW was or much like in November where we had a massive red FOMC the markets didn’t care and we ripped on FOMC minutes hitting the wire. I remain going forward bullish until markets prove me otherwise… things that COULD prove me otherwise… 1. Closing AND holding below 378. 2. VIX popping and holding over 25+ or 3. A huge miss on CPI. I don’t at this moment forsee any of those coming true… &amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/nup9bq5o349a1.png?width=764&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6150120f5b2c6b522d458bbbe68b03b3d237db3cAnd then there was… Tesla…. After absolutely being slammed the whole month of December I have to give it to the tesla bulls and say they finished on a very positive note! Taking a look at our cycles we can officially say we have closed out our downward cycle on Tuesday. That remains the longest and biggest drop tesla has seen during this sell off period. Looking at the trend we should be expecting about a 4 day 14% rally. However, we have to remember that Tesla put in double its usual sell off… perhaps we get double the recovery? &amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/08ws3kpo349a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e2c3b4309647308b917fb9f58d453fd76a4e67e3Taking a look at the tesla daily I have to say this candle body structure is both impressive and confusing. Yesterday Tesla put in a 8.08% green bullish day… however, today only putting in 1.12% green actually was a bullish engulfing candle of a green candle. That is not something you see too often at all. Things to note here is that we are sitting at key 123.2 resistance and we did not quite touch the daily 8ema. SPY is going to need to breakout over the daily 8ema in order for me to be bullish more than Tuesday. However, if this is a double recovery on Tesla we could be looking for sometime before 1/9 for Tesla to retest the 136 to 140 area. &amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/fhf3tw7p349a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3ed06303de64e8aadabb3aaab2e6bd93b692c8dI mentioned last week in my weekly TA that tesla is in a cycle of 3 red weeks followed by a recovery/ consolidation week before the next leg down. Taking a look at the weekly here Tesla could have an impressive pop all the way to 147 and still be in that broadened red bear channel.There also should be noted a critical bounce occurred off that 11.4 support that dates back to 2020. With that level holding and Tesla receiving a decent bounce and forming this possible morning star doji I am bullish for tesla going into the first week of the year. &amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/7r6z6m9q349a1.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dbb1a082433f7fbbac33dc4e86d6f3d5526397eaThe VIX has been detached from reality but at times the structure remains impressively accurate. We failed now for 6 days in a row for the VIX to close a candle over 22.2. With these 6 rejections here (in addition to the 8 out of 9 last daily candles that have held 3845 support on futures) I remain once again bullish for next week. This evening doji star pattern formed here on the VIX should take the VIX down to about 21.2 Tuesday. We as you can see inside of this blue bear channel are maintaining a breakout/down triangle also. Unless the VIX opens over 22 (+1.5%) at open and all day that will be a break through of support and that should start the next leg down on the VIX and subsequently the next leg up on the markets. This movement should take us into CPI week. **Year in review**&amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/unq20crq349a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=36c4cbf85b5c9f967eb56b8774f77a6710408383Before someone says why am I not posting a broker screenshot… well I have moved money throughout the year and also changed brokers and accounts during the year and I frequently take money out of my options account. I also couldn’t find data from January as I was still working full time back then and didn’t keep records like I do now. But taking a look at this the biggest thing that strikes me here is a few things. 1. The fact that my worst weeks win rate was during a green week is crazy to me. But this was back in February when we had those massive $10-$14 days and we could pick up 100-150% wins like it was easy. Aint doing that shit no more that’s for sure. The other thing that is intriguing to me is that my average win rate on a losing and winning week is only a 6% difference. Tells you the overall power of stop losses. Also intriguing and I think really makes a statement is the fact that I had a really 2.5 month long stretch of straight struggling was still able to close out a really green year. This is where small wins over time average out to be huge wins. There is no reason to look for massive win after massive win. And if you have a really bad stretch that is okay its not the end of the world. Something else that really helped me this year too is that when I noticed I was struggling in June I sized down heavily on my position size and I still have not sized back up yet fully to that full position size I was using up until June. Overall a pretty great year despite the bullshit that 2022 presented us. I look forward to 2023 and I hope whether bull, bear or flat that we can at least get a market that is rational and obeys the technicals. **Daily log-**&amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/2sn3kecr349a1.png?width=792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5db5793dc1529e618db602f229c94e0e827d5a34Pretty light trading today. Had that really nice swing win over night which covered some earlier losses in the week. After that the tight morning range and the absolutely mind numbingly boring price action I didn’t trade a whole lot. Took a lotto put around that big after noon dump time and took a nice win. Closed around 22% and it went on to be well over 100%...    Overall honestly despite closing a green week (mostly thanks to that swing put over night… I really didn’t feel like I had my best week of trading. I would have liked to have a better week than I did but I felt like iw as struggling with the technicals this week. Felt like by time my setup finally signal a buy for something the move either never happened or it just straight reversed on us. Even today during PH which granted this was expected to be a highly volatile PH…  the 315pm candle was red and a massive gravestone doji rejecting off a key resistance level. With that double top the 1min, 5min and 15min all being overbought and volume switching over to sell… we should have seen a bigger drop but what did we see? We saw a huge pop of another 0.6% in the last 30 minutes.Weeks like this as someone who trades with a clear cut and dry strategy it makes it extremely hard to take positions. I find myself looking at price action alone and seeing trades develop but being unable to take those trades because of how the indicators are presenting themselves. Tough week for sure. Hoping now that we got the collar rolled, tax loss harvesting is over and everything that we can finally see some normalcy in the markets again next week.

"**if 2022 was the year of supply chain, 2023  shall be the year to tall about u employment**Since when is everyone this much correct and all predicting s major crash ?  Maybe the majority of you are wrong as trading algorythms are reading your puts. Perhaps a crash is to occur only after your stop losses hit when a major bull run occurs early on, then followed by the crash you all have been waiting for only to bring you back to 2022 levels.  Simply we go up , and back down to where we started 2023.We all know that the  feds ultimate goal is to reduce inflation, but the target to do so is unemployment. It is much to obvious that supply chain is starting to ease and  supply is meeting demand.  Supply chain caused inflation is out of the table for 2023, pehaps a little but the majority will coke from unemployment being to low.But unemployment  is already starting to come down and the next job report will signal even more reasons for feds to slow down rates. Before the big dip there shall be a big rip.  likely in my opinion start of 2023, why?  Because of unemployment declining.Job losses Government bonds are becoming less attractive ( yet still highly profitable ) 50% drop in major companies is looking more attractive by the minute. It is far to obvious that the market is due to fall further.  Biggest bank  in the globes suggest a 75% chance of a recession. Here's the funny part ; - i clearly remember reading analysts suggesting in december  of 2021 - January of 2022 that the recession is likely to occur with the next 12 to 24 months. Here we are 12 months  later : technical recession ? Jpow and Mr Biden refuse to call this a recession. But surprisingly, analysts still say 12-24 months....

Even if they meet target, that would still be up 43% or so from 2021. Growth and demand is expected to slow in 2023,  without a doubt, but I believe the $7500 discount was to drive some sales before year-end in anticipation of the $7500 EV tax credit available next year, rather than a severe plunge in demand.During the Q3 earnings call, Musk expects an epic and record-breaking Q4.

" IRS announces delay for implementation of $600 reporting threshold for third-party payment platforms’ Forms 1099-KThrough the American Rescue Plan of 2021, if you sold over $600 through third party payment platforms like Paypal or Venmo, you would automatically be sent a 1099-KThe IRS is basically saying that they will ignore this for 2022 and start this in 2023.Now it's unclear if there will be a change to this. There's currently a few bills trying to change this.Senator Hassan has the **Cut the Red Tape for online sales act** that would increase the threshold to $5,000Senator Cramer has the **Stop the Nosy Obsession with Online Payments Act of 2022 (SNOOP)**This bill will essentially eliminate the $600 and get us back to the good days of $20,000 and 200 transactions.So obviously, this $600 limit might be annoying if you're just a small time casual seller trying to sell some stuff on Ebay.Anywho, hope you found this helpful","For all of you on your side hustle, the IRS announces delay of $600 limit for 1099-k third party payment platforms",1,self.wallstreetbets,zzb8e2,Guysmarket,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/zzb8e2/for_all_of_you_on_your_side_hustle_the_irs/,1672433678,939,114,21,156,0.069,0.804,0.126,0.8674,0.096,0.792,0.113,0.1027

"With tomorrow being New Years Eve, the illiquid market has slowed down as traders are closing up their books for the year. Winding down any ideas and thoughts, its important to see what is waiting for us up ahead. This week, the biggest story is Tesla's brutal December decline as it went down about 40% in value. As popular as it is, Elon Musk's Twitter has cost more time taking away from the automobile company. Tesla is currently at its lowest since August 2020. It will be exciting to see what Elon Musk has planned to recover his losses. Another notable decrease was in the NASDAQ 100, following in suit with Tesla. From a technical perspective, the 10,500 area is a critical level. In addition to marking the 2022 lows, it also represents the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the entire post-Covid rally. While bulls would certainly like to see a big rally off this support confluence, the bigger picture outlook for the index will remain bearish as long as it continues to put in “lower highs” on the daily chart. Meanwhile, a confirmed break below support in the 10,500 area would open the door for a continuation down to the pre-Covid high at 9,700 or even the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement near 8,900 as we move through the first quarter of 2023.

"Attention all WallStreetBets traders - it's time to get your portfolio pine-y fresh. That's right, I'm talking about investing in the greatest asset of all: pine trees.Now, I know what you're thinking. ""Pine trees? That's the lamest investment ever. Where's the upside?"" But let me tell you, these trees are the ultimate stealth growth stock.First of all, pine trees are renewable. Unlike those fancy tech companies that are constantly on the verge of being disrupted, pine trees just keep on growing. And as they grow, they produce oxygen, which is basically like free money in the form of air.But that's not all. Pine trees can also be used to make paper and furniture, so you're basically getting a two-for-one investment. And have you seen how beautiful they look in the winter? They're like the Christmas trees of the investment world. Plus, they make for great holiday decorations, so you can literally decorate your house with your investments. Talk about killing two birds with one stone.But let's say you're not a fan of the winter or holiday decorations. That's okay, because pine trees have you covered year-round. In the summer, they provide shade and a nice, refreshing scent. And in the fall, they turn a beautiful golden color, making for some stunning autumn foliage.Now, I know some of you might be skeptical. ""But what about the risks?"" you might ask. Well, pine trees do have one weakness - they're susceptible to pine beetles. But don't worry, we've got that covered. Just invest in a can of bug spray and you're good to go.Plus, pine trees have been around for centuries, so you know they're not going anywhere anytime soon. They may not have the flashy returns of some of those trendy tech stocks, but they're a solid, long-term hold. And let's face it, pine trees are just plain cool. Who wouldn't want to have a tree in their portfolio?So don't miss out on this opportunity to get your portfolio pine-y fresh. Trust me, you won't regret it. Just don't try to shake them for their pinecones - trust me, it's not worth the splinters.In conclusion, pine trees are the ultimate investment. They're renewable, they produce oxygen, they can be used to make paper and furniture, and they look beautiful year-round. Plus, they're a solid, long-term hold with minimal risks.So don't sleep on pine trees, folks. They may not be the sexiest investment, but they're a solid choice for any portfolio. Just make sure to invest in some bug spray to keep those pesky pine beetles at bay.And remember, this is not actual financial advice. Do your own research and invest wisely. Pine trees are not a guaranteed investment and may not yield any returns. Do not try to shake them for their pinecones. Happy investing!",I told Chat-GPT to write a Wallstreetbets shitpost about pine trees.

"**Please read this entire post, everything is important here!!!**So usually wallstreetbets will find a meme stock and then we all load up on calls and buy shares, shorts have to cover, and then the stock price rockets.  I know people will get upset when I say this, but most of the price increase is caused by a gamma squeeze and not shorts covering.Now, because easy money is gone in the markets it is tough to find a stock that can run from shorts covering and a gamma squeeze. **This is where the genius idea comes in.**  Because of the way that the options market works we can: instead of pushing the price of stocks up... send them right into the ground.**Let me explain:**Typically when everyone on WSB loads up on calls for a meme stock, market makers who sold you those call contracts try to remain delta neutral (they only make money through the spread of the bid/ask of the contracts).  When the stock price increases the calls that everyone bought become closer to ITM which increases the delta, and because of this the market maker is forced to buy more shares to remain delta neutral.  Which then increases the price more, so they have to buy more and more shares pretty much.  This is what causes that huge exponential run-up we see at the top of meme stocks.**We can make money the other way:**Instead of looking for a stock that has way too many people stuck in short positions, buy calls, force them to cover, and profit.  We can do the exact opposite. *Look for a stock that has way too many people stuck in long positions, buy puts, force them to sell, and profit.* Inverse gamma squeezes work the same way here, market makers who sell us the put contracts will want to remain delta neutral so they will sell shares.  When the puts become closer to ITM the market maker will have to sell more shares to remain delta neutral.  This then pushes the price down and they have to sell more and more shares.  It will cause an exponential move downward.The most recent stock this has happened to is Tesla.  Way too many people were leveraged on long positions and when speculators started loading up on puts the stock went into a freefall.

"Energy Transfer is a midstream oil and natural gas company operating largely in the transportation of natural gas in Texas, the Midwest to PA and NY, with certain LNG export capacity.  They have a present P/E of 8.8, a 36-billion-dollar market cap, and a 7.3% annual dividend.Why you should consider buying:Fundamentals:ET has been consistently improving their balance sheet while also increasing their quarterly dividend this demonstrates a fundamentally healthy company. Further, ET has made several large acquisitions expanding their network to increase market share both locally and internationally.  The present political environment makes construction of new pipelines difficult, however this is an advantage for established companies with existing pipelines.  ET has one of the largest pipeline networks in America.Catalysts: In 2021 the state of Texas froze.  This drove the local price paid for natural gas to all time highs. In addition, natural gas deliveries set new records to supply heating power to the poorly insulated homes and businesses of the Southern US. This resulted in a quarterly earnings beat of 89% over expectations.  This December, the US suffered a similar (albeit less catastrophic) freeze. ET is well positioned to have once again profited greatly, both from deliveries and arbitrage from this event.  At present it does not appear that the markets have priced in this freeze as earnings estimates do not appear to have changed, and the stock price remains largely unchanged.Pattern of Price Movement:ET for the last 4 quarters has shown a consistent run up in price prior to earnings, then followed by a decrease in price after earnings and prior to the Ex-Dividend date. The most recent run up was to just under $13 per share. At the present price of $11.75, there is a likely 10.5% upside based on this movement.  Earnings are expected hit on Feb 15th of 2023. As ET is generally considered a boring, stable, boomer company, IV on options is very low. A Feb 17th $11 call is priced $1.00 with only a $0.25 premium.  These options are well positioned to profit off of the usual run up prior to earnings.TLDR: Buy ET stock and options for the FEB 15th earnings, to capitalize on usual stock price movement, and very possible earnings beat.Positions:4000 shares9 FEB 17th $11 C",DD - Energy Transfer (ET),1,self.wallstreetbets,zz4zq7,DogDaze100,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/zz4zq7/dd_energy_transfer_et/,1672418433,2309,25,5,383,0.032,0.865,0.103,0.9734,0.0,0.588,0.412,0.2732

"Since 8 days ago, southwest has cancelled 15,750 flights.**Yes, flights, as in airplanes not leaving**, not individual passenger tickets but ENTIRE FLIGHTS. They are ""anticipating"" resuming ""normal travel"" ""today"". I think so far they've launched like 30 planes or something (a meaningless amount) and are still cancelling flights, but they're worried they're going to face issues AGAIN for NYE travel.Let's break down these numbers.Average SW flight holds 170 peopleNet profit for each passenger is around $250the profit from each plane is approx $42,500$42,500 x 15,750 flights is $669,375,000Ok, so Southwest just lost 670 million dollars of PROFIT in 8 days, and will potentially lost more.But wait! It's not over. Southwest has to pay back ALL the passengers for their tickets, baggage fees, etc... but ALSO compensate them for hotel fees (some people were stranded for 6-7 days, and southwest has to pay for their hotels this entire time), lost luggage (so much lost luggage it's insane) because around 2.5 MILLION PEOPLE were affected by this.Let's say, on average, you comp each person 600 dollars. I don't think that's unreasonable since the low end will be 300, and some people will be getting thousands in comps so I'm being generous here.600 x 2,500,000 is 1,500,000,000.Yes, 1.5 BILLION dollars in comps.So Southwest, in 8 days, lost 670 million dollars in potential profit, and likely has to payout around 1.5 BILLION dollars in damages to all the passengers it fucked over.These two numbers don't include all the maintenance fees, fuel costs, airport fees, etc and all the other costs of doing business. Not sure how to calculate those numbers, but those losses must also be huge.LUV 1/27 31p",Why the F is Southwest mooning when the entire market is down?

There have been many horror stories posted about people who only sold their winners and didn't sell their losers and were left with giant tax bills because of it. Tax loss harvesting is where you sell your losing positions and don't buy them back for 30 days to realize short term/long term capital losses and offset whatever gains you had on winners. Even if you are down a lot on the year if you did not sell any of those losing positions you could still have capital gains to pay from winning trades.

Fundamental analysis looks to see whether an investment is overvalued or undervalued based on underlying economic conditions, as well as the finances of the company or other organization that issued a stock or bond. Technical analysis instead looks at patterns in the price of an investment to predict future movements in that investment’s price.I look for tickers that are trading at least 2 million in volume a day, with a market-cap of no less than 500 million.The shares traded are compared to the average volume to determine how much of the float is used (Or shares traded). That information is compiled with data on how profitable the company is and how much cash do they have compared to what is expected.\&amp;nbsp;||Things to consider when finding the plays-· If the stock volume has traded 1 million or more in volume premarket, I will use that and calculate a rough estimate on what the stock will trade for the day.· If the ticker looks to be trading more volume than the day before, I will consider it for a long play. If trading less than the movement of the ticker, I would consider a short or put play. (If all the other factors previously mentioned checks out.)· The trades are researched afternoon daily to find possible tickers making a big move.

"The Federal Reserve is set to launch a new system in 2023, and one question on the minds of many is whether this system could potentially challenge the use of cryptocurrency for instant and secure transactions. In order to fully understand the potential impact of the Federal Reserve's new system, it is important to first understand the fundamental value of an investment and the difference between fundamentals and intangibles. One intangible aspect to consider is how the Federal Reserve may be able to replace something that cryptocurrency is designed to replace. Crypto enthusiasts may argue that the Federal Reserve's ability to manipulate the economy through measures such as printing money can create pump-and-dump cycles, which crypto aims to eliminate. Some may argue that we should stop printing money altogether, as paper currency or fiat has little inherent value. These intangibles will be discussed further in the article, but first, it is important to examine the fundamental values that underlie any investment.The fundamental qualities of cryptocurrency that make it appealing to investors include decentralization, transparency, censorship resistance, and immutability. These features offer a level of security that traditional financial systems cannot match. Furthermore, cryptocurrency allows for quick and secure money transfers without the need for a central authority, making it an ideal option for those who want to transact without involving a third party. The combination of these features, along with the added benefit of providing users with a level of privacy, makes cryptocurrency a strong investment. Investors can trust that their funds are secure and their transactions are protected from potential fraud. While the Federal Reserve's new system may offer similar levels of security and speed for transactions, it lacks the decentralization and privacy offered by cryptocurrency. When evaluating investments, there are typically two types of value to consider: the fundamental value of how much is expected to be received in return, and the intangible value of something received. For example, if you invest $1000 and receive $100 back each year, you can expect a 10% cash on cash return. Intangible values, such as those associated with a phone upgrade, are more difficult to measure. We may be able to describe the upgrade as better, faster, or more helpful, but it is not always possible to put a numerical value on these intangible benefits. When considering the fundamental qualities of cryptocurrency, there are two forms of cash flow to consider: preservation and returns. Preservation of cash flow involves maintaining a stable value, similar to having digital gold. The second form of cash flow is returns, which is where Bitcoin comes into play. Bitcoin's market cap is currently worth around $327 million, which is only a fraction of gold's $12 trillion market cap. If Bitcoin were to reach the same value as gold, it could potentially be worth over $571,000 per coin. This potential value, along with other advantages, has led many to believe that Bitcoin is a more attractive option than gold. Unlike treasuries, it is difficult to impose sanctions on gold since nations like Japan or China can purchase U.S. Treasuries, allowing the US to freeze their assets and effectively block them from accessing their funds. While gold has its own challenges, such as being difficult to transport and costly to keep secure, it is also hard to quickly liquidate at a stable value. This is why Bitcoin is often considered a digital form of gold, as it overcomes many of these challenges while also providing immunity from sanctions, making it a viable alternative. Recent developments in cryptocurrency technology have sparked debate about its potential use as a hedging tool against sanctions and other risks faced by central banks. In response, Harvard University has released an article exploring this idea, titled ""Hedging Sanctions and Risk: Cryptocurrency in Central Bank Reserves"". This article offers insight into how decentralized cryptocurrencies could be used to reduce risks to the global financial system. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have several advantages, such as being easily transferable, relatively cheap to secure and maintain, and able to be quickly liquidated. However, their prices can be volatile, which has led to major losses for some hedge funds in the past year. The goal for many is for Bitcoin to act as digital gold, offering stability over time. In the world of cryptocurrency, one of the most important values is transactions. Transactions offer opportunities for fees and revenue. Many coins, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, also give their holders voting rights on the chain's activities, allowing them to benefit from any residual revenue generated through transaction fees. This means stakeholders have control over their respective blockchains and can earn rewards for participating in their operations. One issue with this model is the cost of transactions. Ethereum 2.0, which promises 100,000 transactions per second, currently costs around $1.56 per transaction. Meanwhile, the average cost of a Bitcoin transaction is between $1.50 and $4. This is a significant decrease from the $40 to $50 range it was a year ago, but it may also be due to lower trading volumes now that the crypto market has entered a bear phase. Despite the value they offer, Bitcoin and Ethereum can still be quite expensive when it comes to transactions. Many people suggest using private wallets to conduct transactions, but this comes with the risk of requiring technical knowledge to manage the wallet and keep it in cold storage. As a result, most people advise using a service like Coinbase or a tool like MetaMask, which incurs fees and may lead users to consider other options like CashApp, Zelle, Venmo, PayPal, or Revolut. **OK, so back to the FED plans**The Federal Reserve is planning to launch a service called FedNow in May to June of 2023, and this service could potentially replace the need for many instantaneous and free transactions. The first release of the FedNow Service will provide basic functionality to support market needs for a variety of use cases, including popular ones such as account-to-account transfers and bill pay. Future releases of the FedNow Service will include additional features to support even more instant payment use cases. Therefore, the FedNow program aims to replace current market alternatives by providing transactions with close to zero fees.However, the FedNow program will never be able to replace the core purpose of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, which is to provide an alternative to the Federal Reserve. Since the FedNow system is provided by the Federal Reserve, it cannot fully escape its centralized nature. Additionally, FedNow is not a blockchain-based product and is not a digital currency issued by a central bank. It still heavily relies on third parties to function and is limited to the borders of the United States, while cryptocurrency is a global phenomenon with over 12 billion transactions per day.&amp;#x200B;In short, the Federal Reserve is trying to replicate the benefits of crypto while still maintaining its traditional financial systems.",CBDC - FEDNOW - End Crypto'S Key Use Case for Instantaneous Transactions with High Security?,1,self.wallstreetbets,zyz34l,SnooRecipes1908,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/zyz34l/cbdc_fednow_end_cryptos_key_use_case_for/,1672402320,7266,92,15,1146,0.044,0.789,0.167,0.9993,0.0,0.833,0.167,0.34

"As auto industry faces an uncertain 2023, entrepreneur must take some of the blame for company’s problemsElon Musk during the official opening of the new Tesla manufacturing plant in Germany on March 22 2022Whether out of hubris, carelessness or just boredom with his day job, Elon Musk’s personal missteps have served as a catalyst for the decline. © Christian Marquardt/Getty For much of this year, as other growth stocks collapsed, Tesla appeared to defy gravity. The bulls complained that shares in Elon Musk’s electric carmaker were suffering because of his offer for Twitter. But as recently as three months ago, with the stock down only 25 per cent from its November 2021 high, it was still possible to believe that it would escape the worst of the carnage.Not anymore. A gruesome December has sliced more than 40 per cent from Tesla’s shares, leaving them two-thirds lower than their level in late September. Before a partial rebound early on Thursday, Tesla’s stock market value had dropped to $355bn, a staggering fall of nearly $900bn from its 2021 peak.It is easy to find reasons for this sell-off at a time when growth is out of fashion on Wall Street and the auto industry is facing an uncertain 2023. But Musk himself must take some of the blame. Whether out of hubris, carelessness or just boredom with his day job, his personal missteps have served as a catalyst for the decline.One is the mismanagement of his own outsized public persona. Musk likes to claim that his presence on Twitter has been of immeasurable value to Tesla shareholders. On the way up, he had a point. It was a megaphone that helped cement him in the public consciousness as the world’s foremost maverick entrepreneur, even if it brought unpleasant public spats and a run-in with regulators.But as he has stoked chaos and polarisation at Twitter in the two months since the takeover, his personal brand — and, by extension, that of Tesla — has been tarnished.A second misstep was to take the company’s elevated stock for granted. Turning his attention to Twitter at a moment when the auto industry seems on the brink of a downturn, and as serious competition in electric vehicles finally starts to mount, looks like seriously bad judgment, even if it turns out only to be temporary.Musk also seems to have believed that he could treat his Tesla stock holdings like a piggy bank. He started selling two days after the stock peaked and has gone on to dispose of just under $40bn worth of his shares, continuing the sales even after he said he would stop (a comment he repeated last week). With his current stake in Tesla now worth $51.7bn, the disposals look significant.Actions like these help to explain how the stock market spell that Musk managed to spin around himself and Tesla has been broken. And where emotion has retreated, rational analysis has stepped in to provide ample justification for a savage re-rating.For many, it has been possible to believe that Tesla was on the brink of capturing the lion’s share of a giant new electric vehicle market that was about to open up. But as Musk warned on Twitter last week, higher interest rates and an uncertain economy point to a rough period ahead. With customer waiting lists falling sharply in Tesla’s two biggest markets, the US and China, the durability of demand has replaced supply for the first time as the uppermost concern for the company’s investors.Tesla had already warned in October that inventory levels were likely to rise further this quarter as production outstrips deliveries, and that profit margins would be under pressure again. This month it started offering incentives of $7.500 for anyone taking delivery of a Model 3 or Model Y before the end of the year.All this comes as Tesla gets closer to the crossroads that all growth stocks reach eventually. Sustaining the rapid expansion that Musk has promised is starting to look challenging without taking action that will eat into the profits Wall Street have now come to expect.Over the past two years, the 30 per cent gross margin on Tesla’s automotive operations (at least, until higher costs crept in this spring) was roughly double the likes of Ford and General Motors, and comfortably above Toyota’s 19 per cent. Seeking to sustain margins could eat further into the growth stock valuation that still supports the company, even after the slide.None of this detracts from the incredible success Tesla can point to as it ends another year of growth that other carmakers could only dream of. But a stock market value that is double Toyota and a share price at 30 times this year’s expected earnings still leaves room for further disappointment.",Musk breaks the spell he had woven around Tesla,1,self.wallstreetbets,zywnfn,ChuckLeClerk,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/zywnfn/musk_breaks_the_spell_he_had_woven_around_tesla/,1672393695,4662,47,9,791,0.094,0.783,0.123,0.9804,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

He always bounced back from his losses, and he was always on the lookout for the next big opportunity. And one day, that opportunity finally presented itself.It was a hot summer day, and Kris was sitting in his office, staring at his computer screen. He had heard rumors that Tesla was about to announce some major news, and he was determined to get in on the action. He knew that if he could just get in early, he could make a killing.So Kris placed a bet on Tesla options, betting that the stock was going to go up. It was a risky move, but Kris was feeling lucky. And as it turned out, he was right.The news about Tesla was even better than anyone had expected, and the stock soared. Kris's options skyrocketed in value, and he made millions of dollars overnight. It was the biggest win of his career, and he couldn't believe his luck.Kris was over the moon, and he couldn't wait to see what the future held. He knew that he had finally hit the jackpot, and he was eager to see what other opportunities might come his way.But Kris's luck didn't last forever. The market was volatile, and Kris's success was short-lived. He lost most of his fortune in the following months, and he was back to square one.But Kris didn't let his losses get him down.

"Oh boy, where do I even begin with my failure in the stock market trading 0dte's the past year? It's been a wild ride, that's for sure.I started off the year with high hopes and big dreams of becoming a stock market mogul. I spent hours researching different companies, analyzing market trends, and studying different strategies. I was confident that I had the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed.But as it turns out, I was completely wrong. My first few trades ended in massive losses and before I knew it, I was down a few thousand dollars. I tried to bounce back and make up for my losses, but every time I thought I had a surefire win, the market would turn against me and I'd end up even further in the red.It was frustrating, to say the least. I was starting to feel like I was cursed or something. Every time I made a trade, it seemed like the universe was conspiring against me. I even started to believe that 0dte's were just out to get me.Despite my best efforts, I just couldn't seem to catch a break. My portfolio was in shambles and I was starting to lose hope. But then, something miraculous happened. I finally made a trade that actually worked out in my favor! I was so excited, I couldn't believe it.But alas, my luck was short-lived.

"Platinum open interest exceeds available inventory at NYMEX, time to buy Plat!Quick primer:Open interest is how many contracts are outstanding for a certain futures contract month First notice is the day that shorts can issue delivery notices to longs, and if you remain long on first notice day then you must put up 100% of the contract value rather than 10%, so you have to be serious about taking delivery to stay long into first noticeWhat just happened:More longs are putting up the cash to take delivery in January than there is metal available currently in NYMEX warehousesSpecifically 141k ounces worth of longs to 135k ounces worth of inventory. Even worse for shorts is that only 79k of that 135k is “registered” meaning readily available to be delivered into those contracts.This means shorts will need to buy their way out of a big chunk of these contracts or move metal in from elsewhereThis was likely happening today in part as the price of platinum surged 5%.Inventories are quite strained currently, as NYMEX warehouses have gone from over 800k in early 2021 to only 135k now.My positions:I own physical platinum, PPLT, IMPUY, ANGPY, and a small amount of callsPPLT and physical are the biggest piece of my exposure thoughHighly recommend getting some exposure to platinum!Good luck!",Platinum could potentially squeeze.

"I'm going to take some time off Reddit &amp; other social media + from being super active in the market. I'm doing very poorly in school, and my mental &amp; physical health has deteriorated with my obsession with making money and watching the market 10 hours a day. It has paid off so far, but there is more to life than just money. Let me share some of my thoughts before I take a break.Current positioning across all 7 accounts:\~250k $ASTS shares long.524 shares short $CAT.\~6000 shares short $NVDA.I am currently using margin.**Quick Highlights:****For $ASTS long:** AST Spacemobile wants to provide cellular broadband connectivity to the entire world. There are billions of people worldwide who don't have reliable access to the internet, and AST wants to close the digital divide through its patented technology. They will have little to no customer acquisition costs and are strategically partnered with AT&amp;T, Vodafone, Nokia, American Tower, Rakuten, etc. I personally believe that it provides one of the most asymmetrical r / r on the long side of the market right now. There is a chance that the stock goes to 0 if the tech/funding does not work as planned, but if the tech/funding works as planned, a 100x+ is possible (run your own DCF model). The tech has been partially validated through BW1 (cell phone in orbit) and BW2 (antenna on the ground), and also their strategic partners have done extensive DD on them. Full validation of technology is currently set to be completed in the coming months. There are also funding risks, but there is the possibility that the Rural 5g Fund and their strategic partners might close the current funding gap. This is a high-risk potentially high-reward play so only risk what you can afford to lose. There might be some risks that I am unaware of. Do your own DD.**This is both a trade and an investment for me.**Here is some more extensive DD[https://transhumanica.com/asts](https://transhumanica.com/asts)[https://www.reddit.com/r/ASTSpaceMobile/comments/q6tqw8/ast\_spacemobile\_the\_starlink\_of\_smartphones/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASTSpaceMobile/comments/q6tqw8/ast_spacemobile_the_starlink_of_smartphones/)**For $NVDA short:**  A lot of demand was pulled forward during COVID in the semiconductor industry. There's geopolitical risk. Sales are slowing. Insane P/E in a risk-off environment. It's still priced like a hypergrowth stock when it's already one of the largest companies in the world. Margin compressions. Supply chain issues. The growth story is dead right now, and the current market is just unforgiving. Etc. Etc. Etc. I don't think these factors are fully priced in yet. And the rally from recent lows was just insanity. I'm not going to give a PT, but I'm still holding my short at the given moment. I personally think we see much lower, but the market can stay irrational longer than we can stay solvent.**For $CAT short:** Pretty simple thesis: It's a cyclical business and we're entering a recession. + Risk-free rate has changed. No reason it should be up \~50% from the yearly lows and trading at/near all-time highs in this type of environment. I don't believe the growth story here. Construction should slow down worldwide as the recession hits, and assets will be repriced with the change in the risk-free rate.One of my theories that Jeremy Grantham shares are that not all sectors/stocks will fall at the same time. They fall in a staggered fashion. This will let us rotate our shorts around and keep compounding gains if you can get the timing down right.Let me share another interesting thing (\*wink-wink\*): Look at the Dow, and the individual stocks that make up the index. There are a lot of institutions hiding there, and a lot of the recent moves in those individual stocks do not make sense in this risk-off environment. I'm looking at you $CAT (there are a bunch more).Be careful of bear market rallies, inflation coming roaring back (look at history), earnings recession etc. Stay rooted in reality.I will be active till the new year, and I am not sure when I will be back.None of this is financial advice, and without notice, and at any given moment, I can open new positions and close any position that I may have. I might also change my mind on how I view these companies and the broader market. As always, do your own DD, and never risk what you cannot tolerate losing.

"Everyone seems to enjoy posting “loss porn” here. I’ve been lurking for a long time but thought I would also add my woes to the pot. I got into trading back in 2020 and saw incredible gains. It seemed very easy at the time and my confidence grew. Even with COVID grinding the world economy to a halt, my share prices kept going up. Most of my investments were in tech and at one stage I was almost 200% up! I did take some profit and should have left it at that, but then I decided to dip back in and tried my hand at “penny stocks”. Unfortunately I have a job that required 100% of my attention for several weeks at a time. I saw my stocks rising high again and then foolishly didn’t see the dips and crashes coming. By the time I gave it my full attention I was down several thousand… I decided to leave it and wait for it to bounce back! Needless to say that did not happen. And I never found the balls to pull the plug at a loss. And so I watched those red numbers increase every day… I don’t know if I should realise this loss or hang in there…  I suspect I’ll be looking at this account and these red numbers for several years. 😖 Lesson learned (the hard way).",My failed attempt at getting into trading,1,i.redd.it,zyt0jl,Dull_Ad1955,3,https://i.redd.it/cbs6bdz4r09a1.jpg,1672380945,1166,41,7,232,0.096,0.788,0.116,0.837,0.355,0.645,0.0,-0.5106

"Every time I turn on CNBC or Bloomberg there's talking heads describing American's as having strong personal balance sheets. I call bullshiit. The American Consumer is nearly tapped out of all savings, credit card debt has been on a strong increase the past few months. The warning signs are everywhere if you really look. Now that we're passed the the holiday season, three major things will happen:1- American consumption spending will fall off a Cliff. They are tapped out, credit cards are nearly maxed out. Ask me, I know :( &amp;#x200B;2-Layoffs layoffs and more layoffs. As of November, unemployment rate is 3.7%. A lot of companies don't like to layoff during Thanksgiving and Christmas season. Google has been reluctant to layoff a significant portion of their staff...Expect Google to cut at least 3-8% off their workforce. Some friends in healthcare and other industries, especially in the discretionary spending sector are all Saying they will will let a great number of blue collar workers off in the coming months. Consumers won't and can't spend, no need for companies to be fully staffed. I'm expecting unemployment to hit 5-0% to 5.75% in 2023. &amp;#x200B;3- Housing market and rental prices will see a significant decrease. Overall Inflation will drop significantly after February. Great news right? No, not necessarily. See reason 1 &amp; 2. Things will get ugly out there. For those older Millennial's, ask them if they remember 2008-2012 in the real world, where are the good jobs? &amp;#x200B;\-As for the stock market, expect a major selloff in the coming 20-35 trading days. Earnings season will be bad in for Q4 2022 and much worse for Q1/Q2 2023. Jan-October will be ugly in the real world. Really nothing the feds can do to stop the economy and jobs from vomiting and shedding workforce.

"TLDR: $PLTR can be valued based on the number of clients and ongoing contracts.

The approach has advantages over the FCF method of valuation as initial margins are negative, but the value of bringing on new customers outweighs the spending over time. Since the companies’ service is AI software, once an organization implements it, the company sees its value and they tend to renew.Palantir has both government and commercial clients and they have used their products to assist in the production of the A350, combating the rise of ISIS operations in Europe, evacuating people from Afghanistan, assisting with vaccine testing and rollout, money laundering for banks, wildfire risks, minimizing flight delays for the FAA, just to name a few. The applications are endless and the investor presentations always mention their TAM across industries. This (along with a fat gross margin of 80%) was why the company was once so hyped, but market forces have caught up with the share price. This post will cover the value of Palantir’s existing customer base, value of new customers and the value of other operating cash flows.&amp;#x200B;[Numbers from filings and investor presentations](https://preview.redd.it/2qsysoekex8a1.png?width=786&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec43f6b37eb8afa19dbda59e062f92d85ebdd788)# Government BusinessRevenues from government have been hovering at of 55% Palantir’s business over the last 3 years. The breakdown is given in company’s financial reporting. Over half of this is from the US, 11% from UK, 6%, from France, and the rest of the world is responsible for about 30%. With 109 different government customers, the average agency is spending $8.9M annually. Gross margins are consistently hovering around 80% and I assumed that 40% of R&amp;D spending and 20% of marketing spending are allocated to maintaining the services. Palantir boasts a metric called Net Dollar Retention upwards of 140% in the earnings presentations – this is essentially year over year revenues from a single customer. I took this to inform my revenue growth rates of 7% annually. Government churn have been zero since going public, but 1% (losing 1-2 agencies per year) seemed reasonable until 2030 as government initiatives change. If things keep chugging along with existing customers they have PV of $9.1B.[Value of Existing Gov Customer Base](https://preview.redd.it/9gzpzawqcx8a1.png?width=1115&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dbdd99fbd33b1812a56b92d2cd1a7f35810a02e0)The rest of the government marketing and R&amp;D expenses go to the acquisition of new customers, and that came out to a spend of $9.7M each as they went from 90 to 109 customers. Landing contracts may be difficult, so gross new subscriber rate was kept at a modest rate – 4% to make an expansion to 133 customers by 2030 and a total government revenue of $1.6B, 60% total growth over the next 7 years. The value add of the potential government revenues comes to $4.1B.[Value of new government customers](https://preview.redd.it/y40lqbptcx8a1.png?width=1111&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=143f495c6f31b838fdd0902888d7df261edb3e77)# Commercial BusinessThe commercial business represents the other 45% of Palantir’s revenue but here is where there is much more potential growth. With growth comes more customer churn and a lower revenue per customer. Average customer revenue is $3.9M, with an operating margin of nearly 60% per customer. While they also claim that they have a 100% renewal rate, I’m certain that some of their customers are funded by Palantir’s own SPAC Investments and will not remain solvent—therefore churn was slightly higher at 2% ([https://www.wsj.com/articles/palantirs-spac-bets-backfire-hitting-companys-growth-11671511333](https://www.wsj.com/articles/palantirs-spac-bets-backfire-hitting-companys-growth-11671511333)).The value of Palantir’s existing customers comes to $6.1B.[Value of existing commercial customers](https://preview.redd.it/fuo656uycx8a1.png?width=1115&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=26e73f0f37802e7379192d54c475e7433b08d302)Acquiring a new commercial customer costs $3.4M and I projected 10% yearly growth in the number of customers –360 by 2030 which would imply about 3/5 of the S&amp;P 500 and those with the amount of data to make sense to implement Palantir’s products. Implied annual revenue from commercial clients by the end of my projections are $2.2B, almost a 3x of what they are projected to close out 2022 with. The value of new commercial customers comes to $8.4B.[Value of new commercial customers](https://preview.redd.it/8aulqagudx8a1.png?width=1103&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a9ff354bf0d843a2874a2a1a4f47b607352e8b4c)# Valuing Share PriceI also added drag of the corporate overhead since G&amp;A expenses are not allocated to either acquiring or maintaining existing customers. These grow at 5% per year as revenue expands by 2.5x driven by Sales and Marketing + R&amp;D expensesSumming it all up and dividing out I get to $9.20 per share while its currently bouncing around $6.50.https://preview.redd.it/dmcdqw3ydx8a1.png?width=578&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a3e7dde9230497d9339db7d89ffd08c3b63b00a7While I could run sensitivities anywhere, I think that the main drivers of the future share price will be the discount rate and growth rate in commercial customers. I assumed 10% growth in the $9.20 price, but 15% growth rate implies that the entire S&amp;P 500 plus a few others would be customers of Palantir, plus a few others—a bit of a stretch by 2030 in my opinion.https://preview.redd.it/y3hs2s32ex8a1.png?width=791&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=26dd4e0cc7474d8759d80b8bef70c0fef7b271da# CAPM and Other Notes* $PLTR has a market equity beta of 2.9. The CAPM implies an eye watering 20% discount rate (2.89\*MRP + 3.5% risk free rate). I used a discount rate of 12% which seems more reasonable given the client base with deep pockets. I believe my growth estimates are conservative enough to account for the risks, but you can see from the sensitivity how much it compresses the value.* Contracts: for this approach, I assumed an average contract size per customer. In reality, there are a few large contracts and the rest are smaller. I could break it down more by going through their 10Q presentations and get more granular but who knows if that would actually add value to this analysis.* Customer Acquisition Costs: If you invest $50M into a company via SPAC offering and then you gain them as a customer, that doesn’t show up in your income statement and it all looks fine from this standpoint. I don’t expect this to continue but there could be more write downs in value of their marketable securities.I appreciate you for making it to the end of this write up. It was an interesting study, and I hope to keep this updated in the future as the story unfolds. There is definitely space to improve upon this but I wanted to post this before the new year and would appreciate comments.

Since the companies’ service is AI software, once an organization implements it, the company sees its value and they tend to renew.Palantir has both government and commercial clients and they have used their products to assist in the production of the A350, combating the rise of ISIS operations in Europe, evacuating people from Afghanistan, assisting with vaccine testing and rollout, money laundering for banks, wildfire risks, minimizing flight delays for the FAA, just to name a few. The applications are endless and the investor presentations always mention their TAM across industries. This (along with a fat gross margin of 80%) was why the company was once so hyped, but market forces have caught up with the share price. This post will cover the value of Palantir’s existing customer base, value of new customers and the value of other operating cash flows.  # Government Business Revenues from government have been hovering at of 55% Palantir’s business over the last 3 years. The breakdown is given in company’s financial reporting. Over half of this is from the US, 11% from UK, 6%, from France, and the rest of the world is responsible for about 30%. With 109 different government customers, the average agency is spending $8.9M annually. Gross margins are consistently hovering around 80% and I assumed that 40% of R&amp;D spending and 20% of marketing spending are allocated to maintaining the services. Palantir boasts a metric called Net Dollar Retention upwards of 140% in the earnings presentations – this is essentially year over year revenues from a single customer. I took this to inform my revenue growth rates of 7% annually. Government churn have been zero since going public, but 1% (losing 1-2 agencies per year) seemed reasonable until 2030 as government initiatives change. If things keep chugging along with existing customers they have PV of $9.1B. [Value of Existing Gov Customers](https://preview.redd.it/1zbv5816ax8a1.png?width=1102&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad9a524b029ee3a77127c34603b4ee48f8d560de)The rest of the government marketing and R&amp;D expenses go to the acquisition of new customers, and that came out to a spend of $9.7M each as they went from 90 to 109 customers. Landing contracts may be difficult, so gross new subscriber rate was kept at a modest rate – 4% to make an expansion to 133 customers by 2030 and a total government revenue of $1.6B, 60% total growth over the next 7 years. The value add of the potential government revenues comes to $4.1B. [Value added by new government customers](https://preview.redd.it/q1d5xhx8ax8a1.png?width=1113&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d1402d604a763519bd1d3b589ffeb5c22bf53d78)# Commercial Business The commercial business represents the other 45% of Palantir’s revenue but here is where there is much more potential growth. With growth comes more customer churn and a lower revenue per customer. Average customer revenue is $3.9M, with an operating margin of nearly 60% per customer. While they also claim that they have a 100% renewal rate, I’m certain that some of their customers are funded by Palantir’s own SPAC Investments and will not remain solvent—therefore churn was slightly higher at 2% ([https://www.wsj.com/articles/palantirs-spac-bets-backfire-hitting-companys-growth-11671511333](https://www.wsj.com/articles/palantirs-spac-bets-backfire-hitting-companys-growth-11671511333)). The value of Palantir’s existing customers comes to $6.1B. [Value of existing commercial customers](https://preview.redd.it/2ml46j5hax8a1.png?width=1126&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e739aeddde428f37ac2386f09ca27020015495c)Acquiring a new commercial customer costs $3.4M and I projected 10% yearly growth in the number of customers –360 by 2030 which would imply about 3/5 of the S&amp;P 500 and those with the amount of data to make sense to implement Palantir’s products. Implied annual revenue from commercial clients by the end of my projections are $2.2B, almost a 3x of what they are projected to close out 2022 with. The value of new commercial customers comes to $8.4B. [Value of newly added commercial customers](https://preview.redd.it/kgqpf1yoax8a1.png?width=1116&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28634b11d4565df51bddf39639719f2dae2aa10d)#   Valuing Share PriceI also added drag of the corporate overhead since G&amp;A expenses are not allocated to either acquiring or maintaining existing customers. These grow at 5% per year as revenue expands by 2.5x driven by Sales and Marketing + R&amp;D expenses[Drag of G&amp;A expenses](https://preview.redd.it/jg0el96sax8a1.png?width=1120&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d9e2196cc533303242b606b6a2614ed46ec6c23) Summing it all up and dividing out I get to $9.20 per share while its currently bouncing around $6.50.&amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/vxbyat69bx8a1.png?width=549&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab0d9d11f4f487cd64c35eb2c496bcbf41bac149While I could run sensitivities anywhere, I think that the main drivers of the future share price will be the discount rate and growth rate in commercial customers. I assumed 10% growth in the $9.20 price, but 15% growth rate implies that the entire S&amp;P 500 plus a few others would be customers of Palantir, plus a few others—a bit of a stretch by 2030 in my opinion. [Sensitivity: Commercial Customer Growth vs. Discount Rate](https://preview.redd.it/kuighjwcbx8a1.png?width=779&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d84bff5ae1d0e5d489f3d87efe8de65ec9ea9de2)#   CAPM and Other Notes*  $PLTR has a market equity beta of 2.9. The CAPM implies an eye watering 20% discount rate (2.89\*MRP + 3.5% risk free rate). I used a discount rate of 12% which seems more reasonable given the client base with deep pockets. I believe my growth estimates are conservative enough to account for the risks, but you can see from the sensitivity how much it compresses the value. * Contracts: for this approach, I assumed an average contract size per customer. In reality, there are a few large contracts and the rest are smaller. I could break it down more by going through their 10Q presentations and get more granular but who knows if that would actually add value to this analysis. * Customer Acquisition Costs: If you invest $50M into a company via SPAC offering and then you gain them as a customer, that doesn’t show up in your income statement and it all looks fine from this standpoint. I don’t expect this to continue but there could be more write downs in value of their marketable securities. I appreciate you for making it to the end of this write up. It was an interesting study, and I hope to keep this updated in the future as the story unfolds. There is definitely space to improve upon this but I wanted to post this before the new year and would appreciate comments.

"Well that might have been the absolute WORST “trend” day that I have ever seen. I think this is the longest and tightest range I have ever seen SPY trade within. From 1145 until EOD every candle closed within a 50 cent range of eachother. Total movement wise was $1.2 of total movement from peak to trough over 4.25 hours of trading. Absolutely brutal. &amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/5r350rz1vw8a1.png?width=705&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4032f3bedb496c5f877b117fba636c747d3d3046Tomorrow is the Quarterly options expiration and is also when we will finally see the JPM collar rotated. A little interesting data about the quarterly expiration day… this is the first (presumably unless we have a wild -12% day haha) on SPY that we have closed closer to the Calls then the puts. We actually here at market close are sitting $2 from the 3870 calls. (note- originally the JPM collar was at 3870) but it appears looking at the OI for tomorrow the call are actually at 3835 with 60k of calls…. 3400P with 42.6k and 2860P with 41.8k)But if we look at the trends here of the last 4 quarterly options expiration there is actually not a single quarterly in the last four that has opened green… the last 4 quarterlies have opened red and averaged a -1% open. Also interesting to note is that the first trading day after quarterly has opened green 3 out of 4 times averaging a 0.58% green open. A few things to note about the quarterly days too is that most besides the June quarterly have closed lower than its opening price… remember June was when we were sitting between the put strikes too. September 30th- 1.6% rally at open followed by a 2.4% total drop from 115am till EOD. 1% total drop during the last 30 minutes of trading.June 30th- 1.2% drop at open -&gt; 2.2% rally till 1pm -&gt; 1.45 drop from 1pm till 330pm -&gt; 0.9% drop last 30 minutes. March 31st- 0.5% rally until 1030 -&gt; 1.7% drop from 1030 until EOD -&gt; 1.34% drop during the last 30 minutes. That means we are averaging about a 1.1% rally from the morning low to the HOD. After that we are averaging a 2.1% drop into the EOD and the last 30 minutes of trading is averaging a 0.98% drop by itself. The one caveat here would be that this is the first time we have closed the day before over the call side of the collar. In theory I would think all that call OI coming off the books would lead to a bigger drop through the day. But this is going to be a new trend to watch for sure tomorrow. The last two months have showed us what has worked before is not always going to work in this market. &amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/6g661qq2vw8a1.png?width=713&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=757dcedccc7825434226ca215a784aed81f8109aSomething interesting to note is that over night the CBOE equities put/ call ratio had a massive (record breaking) spike in the put call ratio… it hit 2.4 which is apparently a record for it. The last time this happened was on December 21st which also was a record breaking spike for it. If you remember December 21st was very similar in that we were in a very big breakdown pattern and had clear momentum to break through 378, however, we had a huge spike that very next day in the CBOE equities put call ratio and that resulted in a huge gap up and a big 1.5% green day… The very nice day SPY put in a red -1.43% day, however, at one point was down over 3%. That was the day where we had some extreme bear momentum and had touched 375 area and had an impressive EOD rally to close back in that 380 area. A 2-3% red close would put us near 371-375.With what I mentioned above about the quarterly trend AND what happened last time we had a huge spike in CBOE put call ratios… it is very possible we COULD see a breakdown tomorrow. EOD and really after 1145am today showed a lot of weakness in SPY and we could not break through that wall at 383.9. &amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/zw6fqsc3vw8a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8603cead0f668105bfafb43cdcda659336a5fa98 Taking a loo k at the SPY daily here. You can see that the blue bear channel we were trading in has now been broken and we are actually establishing a red support line. With that break down and closure under 378 yesterday that should have caused a continuation down, however, the buy pressure and volume today was absolutely insane. Not quite sure where all the buy pressure came from. So now taking a look at the daily it appears we are actually trading back inside of that 379.6 to 386.4 consolidation range. There actually really is a tighter 383.5 to 379.6 range that has no over the last 8 trading days only had 2 candles close outside of it. With spy closing over its daily 8ema for the first time since December 14th this should provide some upside. I would personally like to see us close over 386.6 minimally before I expect any bigger push. However, if we happened to get a huge green day (1.8%) and closed over 390.1 then I would feel even more confident in a push to the 400s next week and we actually COULD see a “santa rally.”&amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/fg1pc7w3vw8a1.png?width=778&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=050035078f40be67914f03ae719caa98235282a8Its not perfect… but there actually is a nice inverted head and shoulder forming here on the zoomed out daily chart on spy… IF this plays out correctly then that really could be a huge push for us to 410-420 area. &amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/02hfgnd4vw8a1.png?width=795&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a185beaea0de0fb9a653e4d6f3cd4c8d1a89c823Keeping that in mind we actually could see a “short peak” put in near 390 before we see our next leg down. Trend wise this year we have seen a short peak put in BEFORE we get the next leg down. The last two weekly candles (if we closed here) are also reversal dojis which do provide upside for next week. Key support- 379.6 -&gt; 378 -&gt; 376.6Key resistance- 386.3 -&gt; 388 -&gt; 390.2&amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/z93mxzt4vw8a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f9c5cdd091143577c855e27364c761d05560c9cFutures shows that consolidation channel a little better. I did mention overnight we could get that 3805 double bottom and that would be the bulls last defense. They took it seriously and gave us a massive bounce overnight with this daily candle not even fully touching 3805. Futures remain in a 3805 to 3920 consolidation channel. 3845 was previous support of that consolidation channel and there is a more major resistance line still at 3975 which we did fail to break over and close over today. On futures we actually did NOT close over the daily 8ema and actually saw a rejection at that 3870 level of the daily 8ema. An EOW closure under 3805 would make me bearish… and a closure over 3920 would make me bullish. Support- 3845 -&gt; 3805 -&gt; 3750Resistance- 3870 -&gt; 3920&amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/4ar2dnm5vw8a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f5631ec57682c4bf0c6d07e4cf862ba0a6439186Tesla had a great day today. Actually tesla had a great two days in all reality. &amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/d31c0616vw8a1.png?width=789&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e1d623ce4ac5bb14f8ccb9f9446c60d20ff992cCurrently cycle wise we are at day 2 of the bounce and currently at 14.2%. now this was nearly double the drop and nearly double the previous average drop also… so we could be looking at a 4 day 28% pop… that would put tesla at the 136 to 139 range before it sees a rejection. This actually would get tesla back to its daily 20ema which is historically when it sees a rejection. Key support- 117.5 -&gt; 113 -&gt; 108.9Key resistance- 126.4 -&gt; 135.9&amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/m134it87vw8a1.png?width=628&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21923b908f7a8ac733fbadbeec477feb42846921The VIX is holding its support line. Despite that huge PC ratio on CBOE equities we did not get much of a VIX movement. We actually look very similar to December 21st which you can see the day AFTER that we had that massive 20% spike on the VIX. That 20% spike is what caused the huge 3% drop on SPY… expect we saw a huge intraday reversal that gave back 50%+ of the drop. As you can see we are in that bear channel but we are actually forming a nice breakout triangle here too… a drop under 21.6 tomorrow could confirm the upside move is coming that I mentioned. However, if we open and push green here that move might have to wait until next week. **Daily log-**&amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/frmaorq7vw8a1.png?width=764&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f2c3221d87a718c6ef5e4c26404350101c9550e3Not a great day for me here today. I played the overnight put swing however we obviously had that unexpected PC spike and had a huge green open. I was actually a little surprised at the puts having any value left in them at open. I played a potential reversal on SPY early in the morning that was clearly not a fake breakdown. I recognized early today the extreme bull momentum we had on SPY and how aggressively VOLD was pushing. However, I just couldn’t based on my indicators find an entry I liked or wanted to take. Days like today are very very tough to play. When you have rules to enter a trade and those rules never show an entry but had you broken your rules and just “taken it anyways” you woulda taken a win is hard to digest. However, if 2022 bear market has taught me anything… its that we NEVER break out rules for one or two trading days that are the exception. Really outside of my swing play that was a loss today was just a small red day. The red swing makes it feel worse than it was. For me and I have said this all of 2022… we need to be picky on the trades we make and we need to be preserving capital for whenever we return to a “normal” market… I don’t mean a bull market I mean a normal market. 2022 has been anything but normal and honestly… 2023 does not look much better at all… Tomorrow is the last trading day of the year… lets make it a good one!",So Santa Rally is back on?

" In a interview with CNBC, Jamie Dimon, CEO of Chase Bank, shared that consumers are currently spending 40% more than before the COVID-19 pandemic. He also mentioned that households still have an additional $1 trillion in their checking and savings accounts. Furthermore, Dimon stated that spending on Black Friday and throughout the year has increased by 10% compared to the previous yearIt is worth noting that inflation has reached 10%, so in real terms, it is possible that spending has not actually increased by 10%. :)In his interview, Jamie Dimon provided two warnings. The first warning was that he expects consumers to run out of their excess savings by the middle of 2023, which could lead to a mild to hard recession.**It is important to understand that consumer spending drives 70% of the economy**. Therefore, if consumers stop spending, it is likely that GDP will go negative and growth will also decline year over year. **This could also cause a decrease in earnings per share at companies, potentially leading to a crash in the stock market.****In the event of a market crash, the first half would likely be a multiple crush, where the value of future earnings is discounted at a higher rate. This would lead to a decrease in the value of stocks, potentially resulting in significant losses for investors. While this explanation may be simplified, the consequences of such a crash would be significant and painful. It is important for both consumers and investors to be aware of the potential risks and take steps to prepare for them.****If a recession were to occur in Q3 or Q4 of 2023, it would align with the expected peak of the Fed funds rate and with the potential for an inverted yield curve, which is often considered a sign of an impending recession.**Many people **believe that the economy was already in a recession in Q1 and Q2 of 2022** due to **negative GDP growth**. However, it is possible that these numbers could be revised upwards in the future, and it is generally difficult to determine whether or not a recession has occurred until a year or more after it has begun. **Therefore, basing investment decisions on the assumption that a recession is currently happening or will happen soon can be risky.****Jamie Dimon's warning** was not so much about the potential for a recession, but rather the **consequences of the actions taken by the Federal Reserve to address inflation**. It is known that the Fed's plan has been to use interest rate hikes and other measures to stamp out inflation, but they have not been particularly transparent about their intentions. This lack of transparency, combined with the potential for a recession, could have **significant consequences for the economy and for investors.****Dimon's second warning was that,** in the lifetimes of most people, the **US has never experienced a QT cycle** (Quantitative tightening - monetary policies that contract, or reduce, the Federal Reserve System (Fed) balance sheet ). While there has been some QT in the past, **Dimon believes that the full effects of such a cycle are unknown.** He warned that the **QT cycle could keep rates high even as the Federal Reserve starts cutting interest rates. This could create a ""bizarre world"" where the Fed is simultaneously cutting rates and ramping up QT to keep rates high.**Overall, Dimon believes that the US is entering a period of significant economic uncertainty. **He urged investors to be cautious and to consider investing in companies with strong purchasing power and expanding margins.****In conclusion**, if you need the money invested in the stock market or crypto in the near to medium term (6-8 months to 2-3 years), it is difficult to predict what will happen. **However, by carefully monitoring market movements and positioning ourselves as best as possible, we can prepare for potential challenges and opportunities.**",CEO of Chase Bank - Households $1 trillion in their checking and savings accounts,1,self.wallstreetbets,zydh1g,SnooRecipes1908,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/zydh1g/ceo_of_chase_bank_households_1_trillion_in_their/,1672340959,3884,81,14,641,0.103,0.828,0.069,-0.9632,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

"I wrote this article on December 15th wondering what you guys thinkExploring the FED's Thought ProcessIn 2019, the Federal Reserve announced a new policy called Flexible Average Inflation Targeting targeting, also known as (FAIT). This policy states that the Fed aims for inflation to average 2% over the long term, rather than maintaining a strict 2% inflation rate at all times.The target is measured using headline PCE inflation, which was slightly below the target before the pandemic. This policy shift is interesting because it allows for some flexibility in terms of inflation rates and takes into account the length of time that inflation has been below 2% before making decisions on rates.This means that the Federal Reserve is taking a 10-20 year period and calculating the average based on the PCE inflation rateSo if we make an average of PCE inflation we going to have the following numbersAverage Inflation https://preview.redd.it/69qt5bl0tv8a1.png?width=309&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bdd35986d6491dc4992005ab21dc59ac1fb90a11We can see from 2010 and 2020 the average is below 2% according to the graph so I think FED will want to try to average the 2010-2030 period. And if we put the Fed estimates number in play the average inflation should look like this.&amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/ws43b5e6tv8a1.png?width=411&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cddafd899f1d7885160ab8e68a54dc9721d16b1d As the market continues to fluctuate, some investors are concerned about the possibility of returning to the 2% inflation target. They fear that the Federal Reserve will take actions that will harm the economy . As a result, these investors are hesitant to invest in the market until the Fed changes its policy on inflation. However,. When Jerome Powell, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, was asked about the possibility of **raising the inflation target above 2%, he responded that there was no consideration of doing so**. **This suggests that the Fed will continue to talk down inflation in public statements, but their written policy allows for an average inflation rate over time.****So while it may be tempting to panic about the potential for the Fed to crush the economy, it's important to remember that their written policy allows for flexibility in achieving the inflation target.** **We had a period of lower inflation, and now we are experiencing higher inflation. If we have lower inflation in the future, that's okay because the policy allows for an average inflation rate over time.**In my opinion, the market can remain very bullish**. I don't want to be misunderstood as suggesting that this is the time to go all in on investments. Rather, my goal is to show that even though investors may be pessimistic and waiting for the Fed to change their inflation target, they actually do not need to do it.** **Historically, the best time to invest is when the Federal Reserve starts cutting interest rates, not just when they pause or reduce the rate of increases.****This was an interesting finding, and I'd love to hear your thoughts.** Is it likely that we will experience an inflation rate of 3-5% in the next few years, or do you think it is more likely that we will see a decrease to around 2%?",Jerome Powell will continue to talk down inflation BUT......,1,self.wallstreetbets,zyctic,SnooRecipes1908,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/zyctic/jerome_powell_will_continue_to_talk_down/,1672339483,3235,60,9,505,0.051,0.875,0.074,0.9009,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

" As an algorithmic trader that codes in Python, I thought I'd share my experiences on the available choices out there for API trading of US equities. Since my trading algorithms fall under the category of automated, high-frequency trading, my absolute requirements for the platform are:1. Trading of US Stocks (NYSE, NASDAQ)2. Zero-Commission equity trades3. API trading enabled4. No re-authentication required for at least 30 daysNot required, but heavily preferred:1. Fractional trading2. Free NBBO Quotes3. Options tradingI investigated 9 brokerage firms and here's my report below:Ally - Opened an account and API was easy to use. However, quotes from the API calls were 15 minutes delayed and later customer support directed me to a page on their website which explicitly states that no Automated or Algorithmic Trading is allowed, so I closed the account.Robinhood - Requires you to renew token at least once a day, so I didn't bother going any further.TD Ameritrade - Opened an account, but when I tried to request an API key, it states that new accounts requesting API trading are discontinued due to acquisition from Schwab. Will close account and wait to see how the integration with Schwab goes.E-trade - Opened an account long time ago and API was easy to use, but it requires you to manually re-authenticate and renew token daily.Webull - In process of opening an account. Their API documentation appears thorough. A hack with Google Chrome's Inspect mode is required to retrieve access and refresh tokens in order to bypass daily reauthentication of your tokens, but I haven't verified this yet.Interactive Brokers - I've had an account with them for 3 years. Zero commissions on equity trades, they support fractional trades, and options trading. However, all trades must go through their TWS software (daily re-authentication) or you need to have an active gateway session opened. Their free quotes were NBBO quotes.TradeStation - Opened an account and they informed me that they will send me an API key when my account reaches 10k in value. My equities and cash are all at this time in other exchanges and I haven't done any transfers, so I haven't received API keys yet. API documentation is thorough and similar in quality to Tradier and Alpaca. Zero commissins on equities, but they do not appear to support fractional trades. Overall, seems promising and may have potential to be better than Tradier.Tradier - Opened an account and API was easy to use. Zero commissions. Consumer and token keys never expire. Their free quotes are NBBO. Only drawback is that they do not allow fractional trades for individual accounts, just institutional accounts. They have options trading. I'm very happy with them.Alpaca - This is the platform I have been running algorithmic trades on for the last 2 years. Zero commissions and they allow fractional trades. Only drawback are their free quotes. They only supply you quotes from one of the exchanges (IEX) and I found the bid-ask spreads to be pretty wide and unreliable at times. You need to pay $99/month for their premium quote service. However, their real-time get\_latest\_trade API call is accurate and I use that in conjunction with their get\_latest\_quote API call, so the two combined is good enough for my algorithmic trading. This platform is my benchmark when comparing other brokerages.Overall, I like Tradier and TradeStation the best. However, if my algorithm requires fractional trades then Alpaca is my go-to platform.

"Venator is chemical company mainly engaged in Tio2 production business and is currently trading at 0.5 USD with market capitalizatin of 56 millions $. The company made over 2.2 billions in turnover last year. The problem is its debt which is about 800 million now. The company is owned by two main shareholders, SK capital partners owning 40% and J&amp;T owning 13%. The rest is free float. The first debt tranche is repayble on 2024.There are several catalysts:\- SK makes a portfolio of chemical companies which it buys in total. They bought 40% of VNTR for 2.3$, they can buy another 10% through option on June 23. SK is acting usually as an active investor, they should not let the company to go bankrupt. They create big group of diversified chemical companies, they had around 5.5billion $ AUM and VNTR is the exact type of the company they are acquiring\- J&amp;T are venture capitalists from Czech republic. Their average purchase price is about 1.8$. They are big and strong Czechoslovak banking group which invests opportunistically. They own enough to stop SK from any harming steps, if they would want to take those \- VNTR currently sold part of its non-key business for 140 million $ and those will be paid in 1q of 2023 which will be used for debt repayments\- savings on pensions, cease of impairment deductions (from 2018 fire in finnish plant which is closed) and opex savings should create additionsal 50-75million $ a year per Management calls\- usual profitability of TiO2 plants (which is main business for VNTR) is about 15% (eg. Cinkarna in Slovenia, Precheza in Czech, etc.). With half of the profitability, VNTR would make around 165m $ \- due to environment and legal regulations it is practically impossible and very expensive to build new TiO2 plants in Europe. The current book value of the Fixed assets is about 700m $ yet the replacement value will be significantly higher. \- each of the VNTR plants is working independently of the other plants, they can be sold separately for expectedly higher value than in the books\- the TiO2 companies are acquisition targets very often\- the use of TiO2 is rising, eg. article in current Economist [https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2022/12/20/a-golden-sandwich-that-demists-your-windscreen](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2022/12/20/a-golden-sandwich-that-demists-your-windscreen)   and  they might play big role in fighting global warming as well ....

"It was a brutal year for mega-cap tech stocks across the board. But 2022 was especially rough for Amazon.Shares of the e-retailer are wrapping up their worst year since the dot-com crash. The stock has tumbled 51% in 2022, marking the biggest decline since 2000, when it plunged 80%. Only Tesla, down 68%, and Meta, off 66%, have had a worse year among the most valuable tech companies.Amazon’s market cap has shrunk to about $834 billion from $1.7 trillion to start the year. The company fell out of the trillion-dollar club last month.Much of Amazon’s misfortunes are tied to the economy and macro environment. Soaring inflation and rising interest rates have pushed investors away from growth and into companies with high profit margins, consistent cash flow and high dividend yields.But Amazon investors have had other reasons to exit the stock. The company is contending with slowing sales, as predictions of a sustained post-Covid e-commerce boom didn’t pan out. At the height of the pandemic, consumers came to depend on online retailers like Amazon for goods ranging from toilet paper and face masks to patio furniture. That drove Amazon’s stock to record highs as sales soared.As the economy reopened, consumers gradually returned to shopping in stores and spending on things like travel and restaurants, which caused Amazon’s impressive revenue growth to fade. The situation only worsened at the start of this year, as the company confronted higher costs tied to inflation, the war in Ukraine and supply chain constraints.Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, who succeeded founder Jeff Bezos at the helm in July 2021, admitted that the company hired too many workers and overbuilt its warehouse network as it raced to keep up with pandemic-era demand. It’s since paused or abandoned plans to open some new facilities, and its head count shrank in the second quarter.Full article: [https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/29/amazon-shed-half-its-value-in-2022-as-tech-stocks-got-crushed.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/29/amazon-shed-half-its-value-in-2022-as-tech-stocks-got-crushed.html)Amazon (AMZN) is set to close its worst year since 2000 and second worst on record as the stock is currently down 51% YTD, lost half of its value this year due to fears on recession.

"BACKGROUNDI had been teaching for a bit over six years when I decided to change my occupation. Don't get me wrong, I loved teaching, but my real dream was to be financially independent and trade full-time. So, I shopped around the internet in search of trades to take. I spent time on youtube, and learned a lot about identifying set ups, option greeks, theta, momentum, etc. I found it interesting how I was following the same “strategies” as others, but they were profitable and I was bleeding. In an attempt for relief I sought out a platform where I could receive trade alerts, and personalized guidance. I wanted profitable trades, and someone to answer my many questions.IDENTIFYING A GROUP  I didn't know where to start, so I created a paper trading account and joined all of the popular trading groups one by one. Most of the groups sent trades late, when they were no longer executable, or were being run by “analysts” who were in no way vetted or qualified. However I knew I found a winner 5 days into my week trial at Primetime Trading Group , I got clear timely entry and exit alerts on stocks, options, and spreads, as well as access a Superior web of analysts who took the time to explain things to me so I could understand what i needed to do to move my account forward.FINDING SUCCESSWith the $25,000 I had saved over the years I switched from paper to a live account,  and began trading options, thanks to Primetime Trading Group I  quickly started seeing success.  At first I was only able to mimic whatever John, the Lead Trader was doing on the live stream. With time, and after a couple private sessions I became more familiar with what to look for in trades, and how to control my emotions and always get out ahead of my peers. All in all, joining this group completely changed how I felt and the results of my trading for the better and I Hope you guys are able to get as much out of this group as I was.&amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/tu1cb6ed2v8a1.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=617d090a6a6d3853b75f6dd684de083e022837c6",Quit my job to trade full time with some people on discord,1,self.wallstreetbets,zy8yu4,Inside_Focus919,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/zy8yu4/quit_my_job_to_trade_full_time_with_some_people/,1672330085,2067,58,12,353,0.015,0.807,0.178,0.9961,0.197,0.803,0.0,-0.4019

"**TLDR;** Insurance companies are investment banks at their core. They take premiums earned and invest that capital in securities, stock, and debt. This model works because the likelihood of paying out on a policy is relatively small. However, they must still keep capital on hand in the event that lawsuits, unexpected events, or catastrophes occur. Progressive is currently incurring significant losses on existing investments while simultaneously reeling from natural disaster claims.**SUMMARY:**Historically speaking, many insurance companies have been consistent safe havens for investors to park their cash. This is because insurance companies don't face the complex macroeconomic constraints that come with selling a tangible product. There are no manufacturing costs, shipping fees, or commercial real-estate costs for brick-and-mortar stores. They usually only offer an intangible contract of insurance for consumers, and typically don't even frequently have to pay out on the policy.However, they don't simply just take the premium you pay to insure your car or home and sit on it; they **reinvest it in other assets like bonds, government securities, and MBS.** This is where they make the shift from an insurance company to an investment bank. &amp;#x200B;[Investment Portfolio as of September 30, 2022. US gov Obligations make up 42.8&amp;#37; at a \~$1.9B loss with Corp Debt Securities at a $833M loss.](https://preview.redd.it/9f3z41qsku8a1.png?width=1865&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a266ec688b4b01b4e6dc7f0b0309d818a897805a)&amp;#x200B;[Net losses of \~$7B with fixed maturity assets leading the way.](https://preview.redd.it/yqdqp3zalu8a1.png?width=1862&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=525b33c2b376e22ff406eb3265d4f8108ce439f7)Now of course these numbers look bad, but for the sake of due diligence, we have to consider more than just losses on portfolio investments for a set quarter to determine a company's solvency and feasibility as an investment. A company can perpetually stay billions of dollars in debt, yet remain above water for years. As a matter of fact, the majority of companies are. ***So then what should be the red flags to look out for if billions of dollars in losses aren't enough?***As I mentioned before, debt and/or loss across a period aren't necessarily a cause for concern. Over the past two years, there actually hasn't been much that has raised investors' red flags. Now that macroeconomic conditions are shifting, value and balance sheets are slowly becoming relevant again. So let's take a look.&amp;#x200B;[Progressive nets 1.8&amp;#37; of revenue from \~$49B in revenue. ](https://preview.redd.it/47vi4asjru8a1.png?width=1482&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c36ba1df7f3af6f6fd77cd33bf6fd9451d11f9b5)I've highlighted the information that I immediately look for when I pull up a chart. Is the company making a profit? Is the Price-to-Earnings ratio reasonable? Does the volume profile indicate that a small dollar volume could be manipulating the price?Here we can see1.) Net income to revenue suggests that PGR is not efficiently generating capital from operations.2.) Price-to-Earnings ratio is abnormally high suggesting that PGR is not valued appropriately3.) A small volume indicates that a small amount of share purchases can manipulate the stock price to the upside.These are all red flags that in the past few years could be ignored, but are rapidly regaining relevance as investing capital sparingly in companies that reflect value back to the investor becomes a necessity.***But I digress.***&amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/gr1l7y78vu8a1.png?width=478&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a9082125155e2ae4a5828a6c7d5ffc45cf651762Digging deeper into the vacuum of capital that makes up an insurance company's balance sheet, we can see that Progressive has a net cash position of $365M. Their net debt greatly outweighs the amount of quickly accessible cash on hand, but this could be long-term debt that is not rapidly approaching maturity.&amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/rxoyt40kwu8a1.png?width=498&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86ad44e56093bd53cb0ba387bea582257d3687e8Another metric that can be useful is shown above. Here we can see that there are 587M shares outstanding, and 86% of those are owned by institutions. An average daily volume of \~2.5m shares suggests that many institutions have been buying and holding shares for long-term investing, driving the price up as they go. The beta of PGR is 0.46 indicating that overall, PGR is a low-volatility stock with consistent upward momentum.**But is it a good value?**Although the stock price action has been relatively consistent over time, a number of variables could quickly shift sentiment. If any institution that owns a large block of shares is forced/decides to liquidate for any reason, the large increase in volume to the downside would significantly shift momentum since it is not an incredibly liquid stock.Progressive's investments may incur significant losses, further increasing risk. This is especially true for their security holdings profile.&amp;#x200B;[Largest investment held in BBB-rated corporate debt](https://preview.redd.it/mhmmjennzu8a1.png?width=1876&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2430a2d5f174530adc4ed0634471a936c3f9f3c6)&amp;#x200B;[$5B held in MBS](https://preview.redd.it/8wvq9upszu8a1.png?width=1887&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d1fa7efb90a792532bcfac16930d38619a9bda6)&amp;#x200B;[Further volatility in the housing market or treasury securities may exponentially compound losses](https://preview.redd.it/9ua9o4dxzu8a1.png?width=1882&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a07d801fe08359a4c3ae20b1f9cd88b5521b012)Progressive operates in the industry of insurance, but with a majority of its earnings reinvested into securities and equity markets, a bulk of its profitability depends on its investments. It is an investment bank at its core, and I believe that it is not appropriately valued as such. https://preview.redd.it/2n66n4du0v8a1.png?width=1480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38fad4f7c496fb6e6d361d6fa339a72b7594e893The value of the stock is increasing, yet the put/call open interest ratio is not tracking. **I do not necessarily believe that Progressive is plummeting toward insolvency, there may be significant value to be found here. Put option contracts are abnormally cheap for the risk involved in the industry during macroeconomic conditions such as this.**It's difficult to find value in options nowadays, but I've noticed that some options expiring even a YEAR from January are still trading in the money for a fraction of the cost of other put options with similar expiries. This comes with the risk of a lower open interest, but only until institutions come to the same conclusion.***That the value of PGR has completely decoupled from reality.***",Progressive: The Valuation Enigma,1,self.wallstreetbets,zy8y3e,2ndSifter,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/zy8y3e/progressive_the_valuation_enigma/,1672330030,6851,33,4,878,0.084,0.805,0.111,0.9771,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

I wanted profitable trades, and someone to answer my many questions.IDENTIFYING A GROUP  I didn't know where to start, so I created a paper trading account and joined all of the popular trading groups one by one. Most of the groups sent trades late, when they were no longer executable, or were being run by “analysts” who were in no way vetted or qualified. However I knew I found a winner 5 days into my week trial at Primetime Trading Group , I got clear timely entry and exit alerts on stocks, options, and spreads, as well as access a Superior web of analysts who took the time to explain things to me so I could understand what i needed to do to move my account forward.FINDING SUCCESSWith the $25,000 I had saved over the years I switched from paper to a live account,  and began trading options, thanks to Primetime Trading Group I  quickly started seeing success.  At first I was only able to mimic whatever John, the Lead Trader was doing on the live stream. With time, and after a couple private sessions I became more familiar with what to look for in trades, and how to control my emotions and always get out ahead of my peers. All in all, joining this group completely changed how I felt and the results of my trading for the better and I Hope you guys are able to get as much out of this group as I was.","Here's option trading discord I used to quit my $63,000 job - after trying out over 25",1,self.wallstreetbets,zy8sdf,Inside_Focus919,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/zy8sdf/heres_option_trading_discord_i_used_to_quit_my/,1672329631,1939,86,17,353,0.015,0.807,0.178,0.9961,0.162,0.838,0.0,-0.4019

"**Summary:** QRTEA 3.75 Calls, expiry Jan 19 2024**Background:**Qurate Retail owns Home Shopping Network and QVC. They've historically had a pretty strong business, generating \~$500M/year earnings with good free cash flow for over 10 years.Qurate common stock (QRTEA) has a market cap of \~$600M right now, meaning the market thinks the company is going bankrupt (common stock will go to zero in this case). They had a huge fire recently, have a ton of debt, and their business is probably in long-term decline.Macro Axis thinks the market implies [50% chance of bankruptcy](https://www.macroaxis.com/invest/ratio/QRTEA/Probability-Of-Bankruptcy) ... Let's round up to 60%.**Expected Value of Bet**:If the company does NOT go bankrupt it will probably bounce back up to its historic valuations (between $2 and $4 billion market cap). Let's say it bounces back to $4 ($1.5 billion market cap) if the business avoids bankruptcy.Possible outcomes:  1) QRTEA zeroes out or bounces around zero (60% chance, return of -100%)2) QRTEA goes from $1.5 -&gt; $4 / share (40% chance, return of 400% from options)Leverage from Call option will increase this to about 4-5x (call it 4x).Expected value: (60%) x (-100%) + (40%) x (+400%) = +100%Since expected value here is positive I'm betting $6000 on the outcome.**Emotional Aspects**I'm prepared to tolerate complete loss of this capital (since it's a likely outcome).Holding period is about 6 months (2008 crash took 5 months for stock recovery in the positive outcome case).Prepared to double down if the stock gets lower (say $1.25 or less) in the absence of any public material info (formally declaring bankruptcy, insanely poor earnings, etc.), which I think is pretty possible given macro conditions.","6 month $6000 bet, QRTEA calls",1,self.wallstreetbets,zy7ygd,WeirdConsequence9,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/zy7ygd/6_month_6000_bet_qrtea_calls/,1672327486,1745,30,6,270,0.081,0.769,0.15,0.9578,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

"My brother and I were planning on visiting Ohio from Florida in order to see our family for Christmas. Long story short after 4 canceled flights, over 13 hours of delays, and no available rental cars, we were stranded in Baltimore (BWI) for 34 hours. We missed our Christmas dinner and seeing family we get to see maybe once a year. Over this time we watched hundreds of people burst into tears and yell at customer service reps demanding a refund and trying to get home. We witnessed adults getting so deliberately drunk at airports they fall over and puke as they are trying to cope with this mess. I’m sure a lot of you guys are aware of this situation but if you want a further reason to buy puts on Southwest ($LUV), head over to r/SouthwestAirlines and read horror stories that are much worse than ours. Anyway, while my brother and I were stuck we decided to do some investigating into Southwest and why this shit show was happening. We have calculated that a low estimate for canceled flights is over 12,000 just these past few days. This whole mess is due to their crew tracking system software failing. They have had to revert back to legacy systems and manually figure out where each crew member is in order to get people in the air. This takes hours and is the reason they have been canceling so many flights. They have even gone as far as losing track of some of their pilots and crew members. On the very top of this mess, their customer service hotlines began crashing and USDOT is launching an investigation.As you might know, the stock price has dropped \~10% as this has been making national headlines and Joe Biden even tweeted about it. However, there is a lot more pain to come for Southwest.* An upcoming surge of flyers over NYE weekend will most likely overload their systems again as they are still playing catch up from this fiasco.* U.S.D.O.T. is launching an investigation to understand what happened, who is at fault here, and how much Southwest will repay their customers.* The majority of flyers who have flown Southwest in the past few days will never fly with them again, including me. Southwest is the new Spirit Airlines in my opinion.* Southwest plans to refund customers for flights, hotels, food, and any rental cars customers had to buy due to canceled flights.* The amount of bags that have been reported lost, stolen, or missing will generate thousands of claims to get money back.* The upcoming Q4 earnings report will be an absolute shit show for them, as they have to find ways to refund people on the 12,000 flights that they have canceled so far.**Useful Links:**[Southwest flight relief is still days away, and Buttigieg is steamed](https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/southwest-flight-cancellations-wednesday/index.html)[Southwest cancels another 4,800 flights as its reduced schedule continues](https://www.npr.org/2022/12/28/1145775020/southwest-airlines-flights-cancellations)[Senators call for Southwest to issue refunds, reimbursements after cancellations ](https://www.masslive.com/politics/2022/12/senators-call-for-southwest-to-issue-refunds-reimbursements-after-cancellations.html)[$7.2 Billion in U.S. Subsidies Can't Keep Southwest In The Air For Christmas](https://openthebooks.substack.com/p/72-billion-in-us-subsidies-cant-keep)**Current Position:**The Q4 earnings report is going to be an absolute nightmare for Southwest ($LUV) after all the reasons listed above.

I figure 2023 will be a good time to buy and hold these at rock bottom prices. But I've started learning a bit about how to read financial statements and I'm seeing that a lot of these popular cannabis stocks, like Tilray, Cresco Labs, Canopy Growth Corporation, Curaleaf, etc. don't really turn a profit from their business operations.

"How Can You Invest in the EV Megatrend?A three-tier framework can serve as a roadmap for how to invest in vehicle electrification over time.  The first tier is EV auto companies and battery manufacturers, the latter being one of the most vital suppliers to EV makers. As consumer adoption of EVs likely accelerates, these companies could be the most direct beneficiaries of increasing demand, with the battery market alone growing to $525 billion by 2040. Look for investment opportunities earlier in the industry’s growth, as production and demand ramp up.The second is key suppliers for EV and battery makers, including semiconductor manufacturers, chemical and material processors, and metals and mining companies. Investment opportunities in these companies are also likely to be most plentiful early in the industry’s growth, as demand for their products continues to increase. In some cases, these suppliers may be a more attractive opportunity than pure-play EV manufacturers, because they often have a more diversified customer base and derive revenue from multiple industries.The third: ancillary service providers, including software producers, power companies and tech firms targeting the auto industry to offer shared services. Given the relatively small market share of EVs today, investment opportunities related to such companies may seem minimal, but farther down the road, we expect these industries to expand meaningfully, with automobile-related technology services growing to a potential market as large as $10 trillion.&amp;#x200B;Companies exposed to the industry—particularly those focused on continued innovation—could be strong, long-term investments.Read more: [https://www.reddit.com/user/Fatherthinger/comments/zy500n/megatrends\_driving\_toward\_electric\_vehicle\_mass/](https://www.reddit.com/user/Fatherthinger/comments/zy500n/megatrends_driving_toward_electric_vehicle_mass/)",Electric vehicles are expected to account for 90% of auto sales by 2050.,1,self.wallstreetbets,zy5f2o,Fatherthinger,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/zy5f2o/electric_vehicles_are_expected_to_account_for_90/,1672320503,1908,72,13,246,0.026,0.837,0.138,0.976,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

"Investors betting against Tesla Inc. are getting the big bonanza they have been waiting for, with the electric-vehicle maker set to record its worst annual performance on record.Short sellers in the company — or bearish investors who stand to gain when an asset’s price falls — are poised to reap mark-to-market profits of about $17 billion, making Tesla the most profitable short trade of the year, data from S3 Partners shows.Tesla has tumbled more than 42% in December alone, driving it to a loss of 68% this year — marking a radical about face for a stock that surged during the low-rate era of the pandemic.It’s a rare victory for the shorts, whose 89% return comes after several years of significant losses, S3’s Ihor Dusaniwsky said. About 2.9% of Tesla’s free float is held short, according to S3 data.Tesla has faced a tumultuous year, with investors fleeing risk assets over concerns about geopolitical uncertainty, high inflation, rising interest rates and a possible recession. Add to that worries that Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk’s focus will be diverted to his recently acquired social-media company, Twitter, just as demand for electric vehicles is set to take a hit.Dusaniwsky expects short selling to persist until the stock reaches a bottom. But analysts and investors are still struggling to see a bottom, especially as the company is due to report fourth-quarter delivery numbers early next month and has been offering large buyer incentives.Tesla shares rose 3.5% in premarket trading on Thursday.Even if share price begins to recover, its notorious volatility could continue to linger, according to S3’s Dusaniwsky.“When Tesla’s stock begins to tick upwards, there should be a flurry of short covering which will help boost its stock price higher and quicker as shorter-term short sellers look to realize their outsized mark-to-market profits before they evaporate,” he said.Source: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-29/tesla-s-worst-ever-year-brings-17-billion-windfall-for-shorts?srnd=markets-vp#xj4y7vzkg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-29/tesla-s-worst-ever-year-brings-17-billion-windfall-for-shorts?srnd=markets-vp#xj4y7vzkg)Tesla (TSLA) short sellers and bearish investors are poised to profit of about 17 billion, making it the most profitable short trade of the year according to S3 Partners, as the EV giant is set to record its worst year ever.

"After shares of Tesla dipped by more than 10% on Tuesday deepening a year-long selloff, CEO Elon Musk told employees not to be “too bothered by stock market craziness.”Musk circulated the comments on Wednesday in a companywide email, which CNBC obtained. He told staffers that Tesla needs to “demonstrate continued excellent performance,” and that “long-term, I believe very much that Tesla will be the most valuable company on Earth!”Electric vehicle blog Electrek reported earlier on the email.Tesla shares have declined about 68% for the year, though they rose 3.3% on Wednesday to $112.71. The stock is down 42% in December, and is poised to close out its worst month, quarter and year on record.Musk has blamed Tesla’s declining share price in part on rising interest rates. But critics point to his Twitter takeover as a bigger culprit for the slide, which has wiped out about $675 billion in market cap this year as of Wednesday’s close.In the email, Musk thanked Tesla employees for their work in 2022, encouraged them to push hard for a strong fourth-quarter finish, and asked them to “volunteer to help deliver” cars to customers before midnight on Dec. 31, if at all possible.During the last days of most quarters, Tesla enlists employees from all over the company to bring new cars to customers in order to hit or exceed stated delivery goals, work that in normal times is limited to people on the sales and delivery teams. The company has been aiming for 50% year-over-year growth in vehicle deliveries but has cautioned investors it may not meet that target every year.Musk’s attention has been focused on Twitter of late. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO sold tens of billions of dollars worth of shares in his electric vehicle company in 2022 to finance the $44 billion buyout of the social media company.Full article: [https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/28/elon-musk-tells-tesla-employees-to-ignore-stock-market-craziness.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/28/elon-musk-tells-tesla-employees-to-ignore-stock-market-craziness.html)Elon Musk has told Tesla (TSLA) employees ""don’t be ‘bothered by stock market craziness.""

"Blackrock and Goldman Sachs are two of the biggest names in finance, and their recent comments on the state of the global economy are worth paying attention to. Let's dive in in their 2023 plans.In 2023, global growth is expected to remain weak, according to Goldman Sachs. The US economy is predicted to narrowly avoid a recession, with core PCE inflation slowing from its current level of 5% to 3% by the end of the year. Meanwhile, Blackrock predicts that interest rates will stop rising and economic activity will stabilize in 2023.This new economic cycle is being driven by constraints on production. The shift in consumer spending from services to goods during the pandemic caused shortages and bottlenecks. Population aging also led to a labor shortage. As a result, developed countries are unable to produce as much as they used to without increasing inflation. Despite the fact that economic activity is below its pre-Covid levels, inflation is still very high.Central bank policy rates are not the tool to resolve production constraints; they can only influence demand in their economies. This leaves them with a difficult trade-off. They can either get inflation back to 2% targets by reducing demand to what the economy can comfortably produce now, or they can live with more inflation. Right now, the **Federal Reserve** is **focused** on **avoiding a recession**. Although there are already **signs** of an **economic downturn**, **Blackrock** **expects** the **Fed** to **stop** **raising interest rates** once the **damage becomes clear.** As spending returns to normal, some production constraints may ease. However, **three long-term** **trends** are predicted to continue to limit production capacity and solidify the new economic system. **These are aging populations causing workforce shortages, ongoing geopolitical tensions disrupting supply chains and globalization, and the transition to net-zero carbon**  **Venturing into Unknown Economic Territory****Blackrock and Goldman Sachs are convinced that the current economic cycle will be distinct from previous ones. This new economic cycle is ongoing and cannot be halted.** One key characteristic of this new economic cycle is that we are living in a supply-driven world with tough trade-offs. Repeated inflation surprises have sent bond yields soaring, crushing equities and fixed income. **This volatility stands in sharp contrast to the last 40 years of steady growth and inflation.**In this **new economic cycle**, central banks are not expected to come to the rescue when growth slows. **Instead, they are deliberately causing recessions by implementing overly tight monetary policies in an effort to control inflation.**According to Goldman Sachs, this economic cycle is unique because the recent normalization of supply chains and the rental housing market is causing disinflation, which was not seen in previous high-inflation episodes such as the 1970s. This is just starting to be reflected in official numbers. The shift in consumer spending from goods to services, the improvement of supply chains, and the increase in inventory levels are all putting downward pressure on core goods prices. Asking rents for new leases have also decreased after the spike in demand for space caused by the work-from-home trend. This suggests that the official measure of shelter inflation has likely peaked and will slow in the future. New Economic Cycle Requires New Investment StrategiesAccording to Blackrock, the key factor in their investment strategy is the amount of economic damage that has been accounted for in market prices. As such, their first investment theme for 2023 is damage pricing. They believe that current equity valuations do not fully reflect the potential damage and will become more positive on equities when they think the damage has been priced in or when their view of market risk changes. However, **Blackrock does not expect this to** **mark the beginning of another long bull market in stocks and bonds like the one we had in the last decade.****To succeed in the new economic cycle, investors will need to update their investment strategy**. This will involve making **more frequent changes to their portfolios by carefully considering their risk appetite and their estimates of how markets are accounting for economic damage.** It will also **involve taking a more detailed, granular approach to investment,** **focusing on specific sectors, regions, and sub-asset classes rather than broad exposures.****In the short term, Blackrock believes that treasury bonds and U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) offer good opportunities**. They will keep a lot of inflation-linked bonds because they expect inflation to last longer than market prices suggest. **In the long term, Blackrock will remain underweight as long as long-term government bonds continue to face challenges**. In terms of stocks, **Blackrock believes that the potential recession is not fully reflected in corporate profits estimates or values**, and does not agree with market expectations that central banks will eventually become supportive by cutting interest rates.To add more detail while staying underweight overall, **Blackrock is focusing on sectoral opportunities resulting from structural changes, such as healthcare for aging populations**. They also like cyclical in the **energy** and **banking sectors**. Earnings in the **energy sector** are stable even as they decline from historically high levels due to **limited energy supply**. Higher interest rates are good for **bank profits.****While reading outlooks for 2023 from investment funds can sometimes be confusing and contradictory, we must agree that the market is not the same as it once was. New economic cycles are emerging, and the aging populations in Europe and the United States are contributing to higher inflation due to a lack of sufficient workforce. It is clear that a new investment strategy is needed to navigate this changing landscape.**&amp;#x200B;If you guys have any questions regarding this article let me know.

"I have been in SQQQ (-3x of NDX100), and short position since couple of months. I do believe there will be some sort of recession, and over the course of another 6-7 months the markets(NDX, S&amp;P500) won’t give a +ve return. More likely to give a -ve return. Given this assumption, I wonder if it’s better to be buying SPXU (-3x of S&amp;P500) as compared to SQQQ. As shown below, in the line chart, NDX100 has fallen to June, 2020 levels as compared to S&amp;P500, which has fallen to Jan 2021. If the crash is going to be relatively neutral, there might be more room in S&amp;P500.Line Chart of NDX100 vs S&amp;P 500 (normalized)https://imgur.com/gallery/nkycJ6j Box Plot of Daily Returns of NDX100 vs S&amp;P500https://imgur.com/gallery/OcdkjKLOn the other hand, the crash might not be relatively neutral. The rise of NDX100 was outsized, and so is it’s volatility (box plot in above link). Also, the P/E ratio is NDX100 ~30, and S&amp;P500 is ~20.

"this is kinda a shitpost but its all truei started lurking on r/wallstreetbets a while ago and then decided options trading was right for me. i didn't have a lot of gambling money so i made a robinhood account and put $100 in there. so i used a strategy i learned here where i just google for news articles that have ""stock plummets"" in their headline and buy puts on that. turns out puts are really expensive because you have to buy them in groups of 100 like animal crossing turnips. so the minumum buy is a yolo.  anyway i made a hundred bucks in a day with 1 contract of $34 $LUV put because southwest pooped its pants really hard that morning. it was fun but i want to be a millionaire like that one canadian guy. now every day at market open i google for some other company doing something unexpectedly and visibly dumb but it seems like it only happens every couple days.  i made 50 bucks on crypto but that didn't make me feel like a businessman so i quit. can i do this faster? and dont say to buy ASTS calls because i already tried that.",Is day trading really that easy,1,self.wallstreetbets,zxpkq6,Default_Username2774,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/zxpkq6/is_day_trading_really_that_easy/,1672272256,1047,31,6,203,0.042,0.849,0.109,0.9233,0.0,0.611,0.389,0.4902

"Apes, Google stock is so tempting at current stock price. The issue is its CEO, he is concentrated on helping India and converting himself into a retroactive Google founder. He is not concentrated on benefiting Google stockholders, increasing stock buybacks, or product research and development.Sundar needs to stop squeezing stockholders and get to work.$100 billion in cash is enough to make major stock buybacks and heavily invest on new technologies. Every time I Google Sundararajan Pichai there are only news about him and India and about how he carries India in his heart wherever he goes. Like who the fuck cares, get to work, do your job!Also, so many news about him wanting to make India the next technological epicenter of the world. Pleaseee man get to work and stop diluting our stocks!!!He makes 15 billion stock buybacks and takes 1 billion in bonus to his pocket. What da fuck! Is that a scam??? We invested in Google and we are not getting dividends! Stop diluting our stocks man! People are really hating this ceo. He controls the alphabet board. The board members, besides the 2 founders, are a bunch of nobodies that he controls and they approve everything Sundararajan wants or desires including his ridiculous greedy compensation increase from $650k/year to $242 billion dollars a year. What on earth??? He makes the yearly salary of the U.S. president every 4 hours!!! The dilution that Google stockholders experience is insane. No company can sustain that level of corruption!When is this going to stop? Is this blackmail? $242,000,000 a year, Sundararajan Pichai's compensation, is enough to hire the 484 best computer scientist/engineers on Earth (including India) and paid them a yearly salary of $500,000 a year. That would be more beneficial to Google. The stock is falling and falling. Stockholders feel scammed. This needs to be investigated by the FBI or the CIA. Google stockholders are losing money because he is diluting our stocks by taking 242 million dollars a year from Google's treasury stocks.Where is Larry page and the other dude? Why don't they come back to Alphabet? Why are they letting this CEO dilute the company?Google stockholders, do you see a light at the end of the tunnel with this CEO with that exorbitant compensation and ideology?Google could acquire Nokia with a fraction of Sundararajan's compensation. Google could do so many things with that money.How is it justified that this dude makes 484 times the salary of the U.S. president? What a scam. What are your thoughts guys? PD: I know there are bots supporting the Sundararajan on Reddit. Plus the 2 billion Indian who support him. They are biased because he is Indian. The don't want to recognize than this CEO's compensation is ridiculous regardless of his ancestry!Let get a new CEO from India that makes 5 millions a year instead of 242 million dollars!and let's use the extra money to bring the brightest minds and engineers from all over the world (including India)",Google,1,self.wallstreetbets,zxnzoy,_bono983,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/zxnzoy/google/,1672268528,2983,6,1,496,0.091,0.84,0.07,-0.8467,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

That is a pretty bloody January. &amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/dz3feon2mp8a1.png?width=675&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=005b556297f6e0d1d2524f3d794de233ec722660Tomorrow we get another jobs report… I took a quick look at the last 5 reports. Interestingly enough we are averaging a 0.25% open on JOB reporting mornings. Since the December FOMC meeting we have not opened green on a jobs data day and we are actually for those two openings averaging a -1.04% red open… Some food for thought. &amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/59rgci53mp8a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04c252be922ac84af43f2be93a53927ee44d413bI mentioned that diamond pattern overnight on SPY and Futures and that futures had broken through support which should have opened up the downside. Well we finally got the downside we were looking for all last week. This break down today is the first time SPY has closed below 378 since November 9th (the day before November CPI). This also after 8 trading days consolidating between 379.6 and 386.4 the first time we have closed outside of that consolidation area. We also were once again able to wick to and hard reject that daily 8ema. With us now losing 378 support should now be looking for a retest of support near 374 and an ultimate retest of 370.6. If we lose 370.6 then going into Friday and beginning of 2023 opens up a potential for a drop into the 350s/360s. However, if we can get a hard bounce at 370.6 and break back over 378 resistance then we still could be looking for a 390.1 retest. Despite how much bearish momentum we have on spy here I do worry as we have been bear trapped time and time again here over the last 2 trading weeks. &amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/qsdfb5q3mp8a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=15fb5f8c798727fd082924c044036c4cbb6fe548Same pattern here on futures which as I mentioned yesterday with that breakdown through the diamond support it should have opened up the downside flush. We did start that leg down today. We also finally closed a candle below that 3845 to 3920 consolidation period. We now are trading at that key pivot point of 3805. If we lose 3805 then next support is 3750 followed my 3675. However, 3805 could hold as a big support area for us here. If that support holds then we are going to look for a bigger pop up to retest previous support at 3845. If we can break through that level then we are eyeing once again 3875 and 3910. &amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/4f3njr94mp8a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64c37c4634cd5fff105954b966f8a901d8789049Tesla the crazy sum betch did it! She put in a green day! This is the FIRST green day tesla has closed in over 9 trading days (8 red days in a row). This is the biggest close at 3.31% since November 30th which was a 7.67% green day. Taking a look at Tesla i had mentioned before that there is a clear trend of big red drop -&gt; consolidation (red or green) -&gt; big drop -&gt; consolidation.. etc. etc… Being that today was not only a gravestone doji but also an inside day… we could actually be looking at a nice setup for a push back down tomorrow. Looking at this tight red bear channel 117.8 is the resistance for that level. And also yesterdays daily candle resistance level. IF we get another big push up on Tesla that could result in a bigger push down. Key support is 108.9 -&gt; 103.2Key resistance is 112.7 -&gt; 117.8&amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/91295305mp8a1.png?width=808&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e0b7d7273e3917613512612558d888f0afdf607fHere is another fun little chart on Tesla… Since September 21st… if we look at all the days it closed &gt;-4% you can see there is actually a 60% chance that the next day it opens green… the average green open is 0.55%... This could net a nice 10-20% win on Tesla calls… now mind you these most likely need to be closed immediately at open though as it usually dumps hard… Interestingly enough though… since September 21st 100% of the time that it has closed greater than -7% down it has opened green the next day…. With an average green open of 1.63%. Some more food for thought…&amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/6crpmd76mp8a1.png?width=656&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=08a3de3497242e7508c5a39b29732ee2ae919ceaTaking a look at the VIX I mentioned how I felt it has been suppressed and despite every effort to breakout is struggling. Well we actually had a really nice breakout triangle formed on the VIX. It managed to hold support and breakout through the daily 8 and daily 20ema. This too was a bullish engulfing candle. Now the question is what will the VIX do next… today was one of the first days we didn’t see a huge green open on the VIX in a while.. and that actually led to a pretty big drop intraday. The VIX also held its peak going into the end of the day too which has not been the common theme lately. 23.6 is the key breakout level and also the key bear channel resistance level for tomorrow. **Daily log-**&amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/g31br0v6mp8a1.png?width=758&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d414d4a47f5f86e4674da6f54542f57dc0c0e693Today actually was a pretty great trading day. Had a really nice swing put win on SPY and then played some nice intraday puts and l2l plays. I actually didn’t trade much after noon today. The issue was that we were so close to that 378 support area that the risk to reward of a huge bounce which we did get was there. However, despite the fact that VOLD fully support that massive run up we had at noon to 1pm I did not believe in the rally and was waiting for the classic 123 rollercoaster down.However, the issue for me was that after that big pop the technical were just not there to support any more puts for me at least and by time we finally got to a level where they were supported it was power hour which I am not a huge fan of trading. One interesting thing to note from todays power hour though is that this is the first sell off during power hour (sustained sell off) that we have had since December 9th. I do wonder with this support breaking and closing below and all these mornings of decently green pre markets fading into open if we are finally about to start our next leg down.",Is the Santa Rally over? 12-28-22 SPY/ ES Futures and Tesla Daily Market Analysis,1,self.wallstreetbets,zxm2pi,DaddyDersch,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/zxm2pi/is_the_santa_rally_over_122822_spy_es_futures_and/,1672264093,6674,81,14,1053,0.041,0.835,0.124,0.9985,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

"Hello everyone, I hope you have all had a Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays. As we get close to entering the new year, I thought I would be useful and relevant to analyze the market this past year. More specifically, to look at where we started, where we are at now, and where the market may head in the coming year. It is important for all traders/investors to reflect on their performance and see what they did right as well as what they did wrong. Doing this is a crucial element in improving your skills.https://preview.redd.it/1qc6ul5sep8a1.png?width=2270&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8c6e75d82042551eb00497ba6a2ada0d7c1b920bWe started 2022 with a new high, but quickly pulled back from that level in the following trading sessions. If we look further back to September 2021 it is apparent that weakness is beginning to show in the market. We had a sharp pull back in September 2021 with heavy selling. The market was able to rally and recover but did so on low volume, indicating a lack in support on the buy side. As we went into the new year the market was weak and after the first trading day began to roll over.https://preview.redd.it/1uymvnosep8a1.png?width=1441&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=426a7ca9a8971b1be1b7b1b1c8b5cd2be58b5ea9The main culprit of the market rollover is increasing inflation as well as the Federal Reserves response. Inflation does seem to have peeked in July 2022, but this does not mean that interest rates will go back to near zero anytime soon. It is likely that fed rates will remain elevated until it is clear that inflation is tamed. Additional concerns extend from uncertainty due to the Russia-Ukraine war as well as rising Covid-19 cases in China resulting from the end of the zero tolerance covid policy.https://preview.redd.it/1pzuqn6tep8a1.png?width=2265&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=225ad4bbe849cd4486d53b8198cff5af297371fbWith these hostile market conditions, many may think there is little to nothing to do in the market. That cannot be further from the truth, there is almost always some industry or sector that is experiencing positive price action. For instance, early in 2022 the oil and gas industry was booming as a result of decreasing covid restrictions as well as fuel price increases as a result of the Russia-Ukraine war. The shipping industry also produces several companies that had positive price increases throughout 2022. Lastly, there were several bear market rallies within the overall market and individual companies that were not only trade-able but also very profitable with proper risk management. While these are not the only industries that were positive in 2022, they serve as a basis to instill the idea that opportunities are all around us, we just have to find them.Even with inflation subsiding, the market is on track to end the year close to its 52-week lows. So what will it take to regain ground lost in 2022? The answer is most likely Fed rate cuts with a side of global stability in terms of war and disease. However, the Fed is not likely to start rate cuts until mid 2023 at the earliest. As for global stability, there is not telling how long the Russia-Ukraine war will last as well as rising covid cases. So what does this mean for investors/traders? Should we just call it quits and wait for 2024? Obviously the answer is no. We need to keep a similar mindset as we have had this year. That is being cautious in our positions and knowing that this market is still very news driven. An article or economic data release can cause major swings in any direction. We have to be prepared to quickly get rid of losers because a small loss can easily turn into an unmanageable larger loss. For now enjoy the holidays and prepare yourself for a new year filled with limitless opportunities.Feel free to add your thoughts on this past year and whats to come below!",The Market in 2022: A Year In Review,1,self.wallstreetbets,zxl0lm,everyday_trades,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/zxl0lm/the_market_in_2022_a_year_in_review/,1672261619,3862,36,8,622,0.105,0.781,0.114,0.4027,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

" Taxpayer Certainty and Disaster Relief Act of 2020 had a rule that allowed businesses to take 100% deductions off restaurant meals.Prior to this rule, restaurant meals were only 50% deductible. This rule did not apply to pre-prepared meals, grocery bought foods. Groceries are also 50% deductible.

This benefit comes to an end at the start of 2023Here is the rule: [IRS Rules](https://i.postimg.cc/PJPsrQJL/image.png)So let me explain why this is bad for restaurants.

"More debt has fallen into ""distressed"" trading levels, meaning investors are getting worried they're not going to be paid back for lending money to large companies.

"Well as we come to an EOY here and we have seen Tesla in my opinion begin the capitulation of tech and the market as a whole… I thought it would be worthwhile to an analysis of what the best potential short of big tech is for 2023. Now mind you this assumes obviously that we DO see a breakdown in q1. If we didn’t get a breakdown while an individual like Tesla could still capitulate and see a correction… its possible no one becomes the best short. &amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/0naetyw7po8a1.png?width=1206&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=704c0ef0f040e5eeb2ce06ef93452b57bb5d259aNote- all data for this document was obtained on 12/27 during and after market close. Now lets go ahead and break this all down and rank them… what I am going to do is rank 1 through 9… 1 would be a bearish indicator on the stock and a 9 would be a bullish indicator. **What is Trailing P/E vs. Forward P/E?**The forward P/E uses projected future earnings to calculate the price-to-earnings ratio. The trailing P/E, which is the standard form of a price-to-earnings ratio, is calculated using recent past earnings.&amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/de6ha5h8po8a1.png?width=413&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d059b0b2296346ca71885894283b9bce0959276dBased on standard PE we actually see that Amazon has the current highest PE at 78.28 and Meta (not surprisingly) has the lowest PE at 11.24). This would indicate a strike against Amazon and make it strictly looking at PE the best short. This would obviously make Meta the worse short. &amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/qa8hslx8po8a1.png?width=403&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f629576a31bde62cbce6f297ab42cb71f85d7a4Taking a look at forward P/E you can see that still Amazon with 50.57 has the worst F P/E and Meta at 14.72 has the most favorable PE. **What Is the Price/Earnings-to-Growth (PEG) Ratio?** &amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/krqn1zm9po8a1.png?width=374&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be5b022629ae3b14369bb3e2e90e3cd02f6d3dbcThe price/earnings to growth ratio (PEG ratio) is a stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio divided by the growth rate of its earnings for a specified time period. A PEG ratio of under 1.0 can indicate a stock is undervalued and a potential buy. A PEG above 1.0 can indicate an overvalued stock.Taking a look at the PEG ratio (remember the higher the level the most overbought/ over valued the stock is) we see that nvidia with a 3.55 is the most overbought and amazon comes in next with a 2.95. Not surprising Tesla has the lowest at 0.84 (mostly due to the 40%+ drop in the month of December). **% changes from critical points** &amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/y1oa9bbapo8a1.png?width=416&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe9f1dd84c3b859eb07e0e10be2c8509d6033f00Taking a look at the YTD drop Tesla has had the biggest YTD drop at 71.48% and SPY actually had the smallest YTD drop of just 17.33%. &amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/xwpdu7uapo8a1.png?width=378&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98af72979fe04efca15539a8171f6ce9dd363cb0This breakdown here represents how far above or below the ticker currently is of its weekly 200ema. Apple, MSFT and SPY are the only tickers above its weekly 200ema (the positive number) and all the other tickers are below that number (represented by the negative number). The number represents what % below or % above the weekly 200ema they are…   Currently Apple is the further above its weekly 200ema which could represent that it has the biggest room to fall… Meta is the furthest below its Weekly 200ema. &amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/aghcqxdbpo8a1.png?width=415&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc0c9617fbf5c5fc1c7cee4a8209cebb431bf1b7Taking a look at the % the ticker currently sits below its ATH. You can see that Tesla is sitting -74.7% below its ATH while SPY is only 20.6% below its ATH making SPY potentially have the biggest room to fall. &amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/7po7icxbpo8a1.png?width=359&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eeb081d2e6f53b36856a35927e0df4299bce58bfThis one here represent how far above or below the current ticker is from the 2020 Covid crash lows. Many believe that the 2020 covid lows is the likely target if we have a market wide sell off in Q1. As you can see Nvidia and Meta are the only tickers below their covid 2020 lows. Tesla surprisingly is still 78.6% above its Covid 2020 low. **June 16th 2023 Put Premium**Using the optionscalculator to “optimize” the best put play I came up with the following strikes for potential June 16th DTE puts. &amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/sfowsdfcpo8a1.png?width=425&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=390f7e1b70c7831d2f4097635253db4d4db3b51cThe reason I wanted to include this as it shows how pricey premiums already are. As you can see Tesla not surprisingly due to its high IV and further drop expectations is one of the highest premiums and Google remains the lowest. **Lets rank the most “overvalued” and most “oversold”**      https://preview.redd.it/usobec0dpo8a1.png?width=338&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1bb728f541467c395e1950e87dbf9bbf9a363951Remember we ranked 1 through 9. With 1 being overvalued and 9 being oversold. Therefore the lower the overall numbers using all the above metrics the potential better short a stock ticker is. So taking a look here we see that Apple is the clear short winner with Amazon, MSFT, and SPY close behind. Now lets take a look at these and where we could be heading. We will take a look at Apple, Amazon, MSFT and SPY weekly charts. **Apple Weekly chart** &amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/u4nm4xkdpo8a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9fe8cf5e35b2a2f82460e17891d83eb9f6768c92The apple weekly chart in my opinion has the most room to fall… a few big targets to keep in mind here… Weekly 200ema- 120.15Late 2020 support- 106.9March 2020 support- 57.4Current bear channel march projection- 64.33 Current bear channel June projection- 44.15**Amazon Weekly Chart** &amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/w7y6a83epo8a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3da709dfc0f93152e1a3d74acf28d086eefa5adTaking a look here you can see we have been riding down the weekly 8ema and we are within a few weeks of the death cross on amazon (100ema below 200ema). March 2020 support- $81.74Current bear channel march projection- $47.31 Current bear channel June projection- $322017 support- $47.312016 support- $24.36**MSFT weekly chart**&amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/zetxxbmepo8a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a1b52631108877f5136f2aa0c57a2ca03449944Now when you take a look at MSFT I think much like apple it has one of the strongest of big techs charts this year. It has not seen that massive drop like most of tech has. However, Apple and MSFT are obviously the biggest holdings in SPY for a reason…Weekly 200ema- $224.47Late 2020 support- $196.4March 2020 support- $136.8Current bear channel march projection- $177.85 Current bear channel June projection- $157.57**SPY weekly chart**Last but not least is our boy spy… &amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/oset9i8fpo8a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7388a2aa00b12725009ceb5af661497cc2906051Taking a look at SPY here you can see that we have that similar breakdown as big tech but our bear channel is way wider than most of tech. Weekly 200ema- $366.89Late 2020 support- $325.6March 2020 support- $228Current bear channel march projection- $300 Current bear channel June projection- $281&amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;So there you have it guys… what I am calling “The Big Short of 2023.” Which ticker do you think is the best short? For me from a strictly technical stand point SPY and Apple are the best shorts. However, when I look at everything I personally feel like Amazon is the best potential big short of 2023.",The Big Short of 2023: Who is the next Tesla?,1,self.wallstreetbets,zxhdfw,DaddyDersch,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/zxhdfw/the_big_short_of_2023_who_is_the_next_tesla/,1672253077,7806,45,10,1044,0.039,0.869,0.093,0.9945,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Their two main plays are cybersecurity and IoT, with a specific focus on QNX, a real-time operating system currently installed in 215M+ vehicles on the road.  While cybersecurity has been disappointing, QNX has been steady and shows promise.  QNX is used by 24 of the top 25 electric vehicle manufacturers (only missing Tesla) and medical/industrial equipment.  You will see articles saying QNX is being ditched for Android Auto, but this is just for infotainment.  QNX is still in these cars for safety-critical systems and runs below Android Auto.  To use a crude analogy, Android Auto is like Chrome and QNX is Windows.  However, this post is on a new product, called **Blackberry Ivy**, which has no known competitor and is first-to-market.**What is Blackberry Ivy?**Ivy is an auto software product that processes and standardizes sensor data both in the car and in the cloud. It allows for applications do be built more efficiently in cars and, in my opinion, will transform the auto apps market just like Apple app store or Android/Google Play did to phone apps.To give just one example of what Ivy could do, imagine being a third-party app developer who wants to build an app for the auto market that recognizes when a vehicle occupant has fallen asleep, so the vehicle environment can be adjusted for a more enjoyable ride (e.g. The app would turn off air conditioning near that person, turn off volume from closest speaker, etc.). The way to determine if an occupant has fallen asleep is by using data from an inward-facing camera.  However, the auto manufacturer would never grant access to raw camera data to a third-party app developer. This is where Ivy comes in. Ivy standardizes the outputs, so you do not need the raw data. The data from the camera is sent to Ivy, where it is processed to standard outputs  (e.g. Driver = awake, Front-Passenger = awake, Rear-Right-Passenger =  asleep, etc.). The app uses these standardized outputs to create some action in the vehicle without ever seeing the actual video feed.An app created with Ivy can then be used with any auto manufacturer using Ivy software, creating a  much larger app market.  A developer no longer has to make separate apps for Ford and BMW vehicles systems, he can just build his app with Ivy and that will work on any car using Ivy.  (Think how cell phones used to each create their own apps, until Android allowed them to share a common marketplace).  This is especially important for niche apps that already struggle to find a market.The previous example is just a single example. There are numerous use-cases that can be described for vehicle payment systems, insurance, car maintenance, etc. with many of these already in the works. There is also tremendous potential for a consumer-focused or novelty app marketplace.  For example, Spotify could make a feature in their app that identifies the occupants and their music preferences, so the vehicle only plays songs that the most number of occupants would enjoy. That way someone who loves country music will not have to suffer through a rap playlist (e.g. In-ward facing camera sends video data to Ivy, Ivy outputs: Occupant ID: 30432493, Occupant ID: 34824492 are sent to the Spotify app, which uses an algorithm to cross-reference these IDs with playlists and finds songs both occupants would enjoy.  Spotify never has to see the raw camera data, yet it gives them a great feature for their app.  The car manufacturer benefits because they can create a better driving experience without having to spend a lot of money developing niche apps). This, of course, assumes some level of permission has been given by the occupants to be identified.**What is Blackberry Ivy worth in revenue?**BB's SAM estimate of $800M for Ivy in 2024 suggests Ivy could be worth up to $36.36/car/year (based on \~20M QNX vehicles and \~2M Tesla vehicles being produced in 2024).  I encourage you to do your own calculation.  Let's say Ivy is worth $10/car/year (with BB getting a 50% cut for $5/car/year).  Multiply $5/car/year by how many cars you think may adopt Ivy and be on the road for any given year (remember, BB QNX is currently installed into \~20M new cars each year, with the EV market set to grow).If all 215M+ cars that currently run on QNX had Ivy, that would produce $1B in revenue each year.  I  believe Ivy will eventually bring in $1B/year for BB, the question is will it take 5 year or 10 years to get there.  Keep in mind, BB’s total revenue for FY 2022 (essentially calendar year 2021) was $718M, so this  would be a significant jump in revenue.BB's SAM disclosure for Ivy can be found here @ 24:17 (Note: FY 2025 for BB is essentially calendar year 2024): [https://wsw.com/webcast/oppenheimer23/bb/2273700](https://wsw.com/webcast/oppenheimer23/bb/2273700)**What would this do to the stock price?**BB would now be valued more like a high growth stock. BB currently has a P/S ratio of 3.1. High growth stocks like Crowdstrike (11.6), Cloudflare (16.4), Datadog (15.0), and ZScaler (12.7) all have much higher P/S ratios. If BB were to be valued similar to these companies (e.g. P/S ratio of 15) that would put the stock price at $15.92/share just for 2024. **This target stock price does not take into account any future revenue from Ivy, only BB being valued more like a growth stock based on current revenue.****Will Blackberry Ivy actually be adopted by auto manufacturers?**There have been a number of recent indicators suggesting Ivy will be adopted by auto manufacturers.   Ivy is a 50/50 partnership with Amazon, but it is only in the last couple of months that Amazon AWS engineers have become more vocal about Ivy.  Sure, Amazon is involved in many ventures, but this seems different.  Ivy was featured a number of times at Amazon's re:Invent 2022 conference just a few weeks ago.  Amazon's general manager of automotive name-dropped Blackberry Ivy during a  presentation and that presentation had two other speakers: a senior vice president from Stellantis, who spoke about how Stellantis (which owns  Dodge/Fiat/Chrysler/Jeep/Opel/Peugeot/Ram/Vauxhall) is transitioning to a software-defined vehicle, and Amazon's general manager of automotive   technology, who discussed BB's QNX operating system and how Amazon was bringing it to the cloud.  Here is the presentation (Ivy name-drop after 13:00): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Tse4B-fnbI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Tse4B-fnbI)The inclusion of Stellantis in a presentation discussing BB Ivy and BB QNX is notable.  When the first live demo of Ivy was presented at Bosch ConnectedWorld 2022 in November, the vehicle used in the demo was a Peugeot, a brand owned by Stellantis (Bosch, a leading supplier for automotive, is also partnering with Ivy).  At the earnings call last week, BB announced they will be demoing Ivy at CES 2023 in a Jeep Cherokee, another brand owned by Stellantis.[Ivy live demo at Bosch ConnectedWorld in November](https://preview.redd.it/ldum9emvwn8a1.jpg?width=1125&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=519417edfdb6e37f082ad1f47fafde651d810e44)BB announced they hope to have the first design win for Ivy by CES on Jan 5-8 and I expect Stellantis will be the first manufacturer to sign-on to Ivy (If it's not announced at CES, the next bet would be the earnings call in March).  Stellantis' CEO will also deliver a keynote at CES.Re:Invent also featured another presentation on Blackberry Ivy being run by representatives from Amazon and Bosch.  That presentation was shared by two BMW engineers discussing machine learning.  One of Ivy's selling points is to better allow for machine learning models to be applied to   the data generated by the car sensors.  BMW also recently signed deals with Amazon AWS and already uses BB QNX.  Here is the presentation:[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI2RwYUN92E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI2RwYUN92E)It's an interesting coincidence that Stellantis and BMW are in presentations that discuss/mention BB Ivy, as well as doing public demos in Stellantis vehicles.The AWS/Bosch presentation on Ivy had a very interesting slide showing companies that are already partnering with Ivy and showing some potential use-cases for Ivy:https://preview.redd.it/f0o8xzuzwn8a1.png?width=1090&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c94d6b3741ce24375f0bc3c6a4ed5790035bb9aNotice TomTom is mentioned for location-based services.  TomTom recently announced a collaboration with Amazon, Meta (Facebook), and Microsoft to create a new open map data system known as Overture Maps Foundation to counter Google Maps' dominance.  Does TomTom plan to send their own version of a Google Street View car around the world?  No.  It appears that TomTom plans to leverage the data already being collected by software-defined vehicles on the road.  How can TomTom use data from different auto manufacturers, each with their own systems?  Ivy standardizes it.  TomTom can then use the improved maps to service consumers.  Auto manufacturers bring in additional revenue selling the data collected from the vehicles and consumers get greatly improved mapping services.  Everyone wins.  And it is Ivy that facilitates this.  (Credit to [u/snoutandtruffle](https://www.reddit.com/u/snoutandtruffle/) for bringing TomTom to my attention.  I recommend reading every one of his posts about Ivy as he is the best at spotting new info, IMHO).Blackberry Ivy is also agnostic, meaning manufacturers don't have to use Amazon AWS cloud or BB QNX in order to use Ivy.  This gives them complete control over the data.**Final Thoughts:**I'm not here to pump and dump a stock.  I'm also not claiming BB will become a $1T company.  But, I believe BB will be successful and will become many times more valuable than it is now.  Time will tell.  Keep an eye on BB.  Set reminders for Jan 9 and Mar 31 and see if any auto manufacturers have signed-on to Ivy.  If they have (especially if Stellantis is named), come back to this post with a new set of eyes.I am long BB with a price average below $10 CAD.  I have held for 4 or 5 years (pre-meme).

"Malick Diop felt something shifting on Wall Street.He’d joined Morgan Stanley in the grim days of 2009, when big banks were trying to pay back taxpayer bailouts and deflect public fury. But four years later, the ire was fading and ambition was the order of the day.“It really felt like, for the first time, the job and the career weren’t defined by the context of the financial crisis,” Diop said. “We are past this now. And now it’s time for us to do new deals.” In the years that followed, his rise to managing director traced a new boom. He helped orchestrate a multibillion-dollar deal with SoftBank Group, whose breakneck investments defined an era, then closed a huge SPAC merger at the height of that rush.Diop didn’t know it, but he was playing a small role in something almost unfathomably lucrative: The first trillion-dollar decade for the six giants of US banking. That’s not $1 trillion of total revenue, it’s pure profit.Such a haul didn’t seem possible before the decade began, when Wall Street was the target of a global protest movement and politicians at both ends of the spectrum were seething over bailouts or aiming to break up too-big-to-fail lenders. &amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;Read more:[https://www.reddit.com/user/Fatherthinger/comments/zxay5b/wall\_streets\_big\_banks\_score\_1\_trillion\_of\_profit/](https://www.reddit.com/user/Fatherthinger/comments/zxay5b/wall_streets_big_banks_score_1_trillion_of_profit/)",Wall Street’s Big Banks Score $1 Trillion of Profit in a Decade,1,self.wallstreetbets,zxdbqm,Fatherthinger,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/zxdbqm/wall_streets_big_banks_score_1_trillion_of_profit/,1672243557,1436,63,12,203,0.041,0.917,0.043,0.3437,0.0,0.775,0.225,0.4404

The delay between the Filing Date and the Transaction Date is **\*roughly\*** 2 days and your mileage will vary. This means that **more transactions for past dates can arrive in future filings.** That is why looking at larger trends is key.2.

"$V and $MA both are global payment processing companies that operate networks of electronic payment systems and issue credit and debit cards. $V is the larger of the two companies and has a larger global presence. They both generate revenue by charging fees to merchants and financial institutions for the use of their payment processing network. They enable the electronic transfer of funds between banks and other financial institutions.$AAPL has moved in recent years into the payment service. With Apple wallet, a digital wallet that allows you to store and manage your loyalty cards, boarding passes, movie tickets, coupons, and other types of passes in one place, and with Apple Pay, which allows users to make payments in person, in iOS apps, and on the web, with connecting. These services have been embraced by many customers.According to the National Retail Federation, the adoption of mobile payments like Apple Pay has been steadily increasing in the US, with an estimated of 34% of smartphone users making a mobile payment in 2021. Additionally, in a recent survey said that 73% of respondents said contactless payments were a more convenient form of payment. The only disadvantage is that not all consumers, particularly older ones, don’t feel comfortable with the technology.So with a large costume base and user exposure, if $AAPL decides to one day create its own credit card will $V and $MA go bankrupt?Let’s look at some financials:* $V total revenue $29.310B, Net income $14.957B, and Free Cash Flow of $17.879B. $MA total revenue $18.884B, Net income $8.687B, and Free Cash Flow of $8.649B.* $V revenue has grown in the last year by 21%, and $MA revenue has grown in the last year by 23%.* $V has a ROE of 0.420% and $MA has a ROE of 1.538%.* $V ROIC is 24.23% and $MA ROIC is 43.32%**I am currently holding $V should I sell?**",$V VS $MA VS $AAPL.... are $V and $MA in danger?,1,self.wallstreetbets,zx9zfc,stock_122,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/zx9zfc/v_vs_ma_vs_aapl_are_v_and_ma_in_danger/,1672235229,1848,48,11,312,0.017,0.909,0.073,0.9581,0.254,0.746,0.0,-0.5267

Fundamental analysis looks to see whether an investment is overvalued or undervalued based on underlying economic conditions, as well as the finances of the company or other organization that issued a stock or bond. Technical analysis instead looks at patterns in the price of an investment to predict future movements in that investment’s price.\*I look for tickers that are trading at least 2 million in volume a day, with a market-cap of no less than 500 million.\*\*The shares traded are compared to the average volume to determine how much of the float is used (Or shares traded). That information is compiled with data on how profitable the company is and how much cash do they have compared to what is expected.\*||\&amp;nbsp;\*\*Things to consider when finding the plays-\*\*· If the stock volume has traded 1 million or more in volume premarket, I will use that and calculate a rough estimate on what the stock will trade for the day.· If the ticker looks to be trading more volume than the day before, I will consider it for a long play. If trading less than the movement of the ticker, I would consider a short or put play. (If all the other factors previously mentioned checks out.)· The trades are researched afternoon daily to find possible tickers making a big move.

"[https://www.nber.org/papers/w30748](https://www.nber.org/papers/w30748)In the 80s and 90s, being added to the S&amp;P 500 went hand in hand with a boost of 4 - 7%, and being deindexed led to a similarly powerful negative effect. But since 2010 that effect has largely disappeared. This is the authors' summary of why this is the case, but I don't really understand it (my bad, not theirs):""To sum up, our assessment is that the declining index effect is driven by primarily two factors: an increase in migrations over time from the S&amp;P MidCap Index, and an overall increase in the market’s ability to provide liquidity to index changes. We cannot rule out that a third factor, increased predictability of index changes, played some role. Overall then, when demand shocks become regular and repeated, competitive markets adapt over time to minimize price impact...""","New study shows that since 2010, being added to (or removed from) the S&amp;P 500 no longer increases (or decreases) a company's results",1,self.wallstreetbets,zx6608,fotogneric,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/zx6608/new_study_shows_that_since_2010_being_added_to_or/,1672222702,869,136,23,136,0.095,0.746,0.16,0.7906,0.095,0.905,0.0,-0.296

"Hello Regards.This is my first post here and i would like to present to you a true regarded bet, since i found nothing related to this stock in this sub.A friend of my presented this company to me, named Neonode, which is currently in a legal dispute with Apple, Samsung and Alphabet regarding a patent relevant to the ""slide to unlock"" function present in almost every produced phone from these companies. Neonode claims they were the ones that invented the slide to unlock function and is now suing the giants for patent infringement. The interesting thing is that Neonode actually had success in the first leg in the legal dispute where Apple and Samsung tried to invalidate the patent, but the judge decided the Neonode patent from the early 2000's was valid.IF the second half of the legal dispute is won in January, the company could see huge upsides. (And if a loss, even larger downside). This is why i think this case suits this subreddit so well, it is merely an educated coin flip.

"I hope this message finds you well. I am seeking some advice and guidance on a financial decision I am currently facing. As some background information, I recently inherited a large sum of money from my dad passing away - specifically, 4 million dollars. While this has certainly been a difficult time for me emotionally, I am now faced with the task of figuring out what to do with this sudden windfall.One option that I have been considering is investing a portion of this money into the stock market. In particular, I have been drawn to the idea of investing in Getty Images, as I have heard that they are a reputable and successful company. I am attracted to the stability and potential for growth that a well-established company like Getty Images might offer.However, I am by no means an expert in the stock market, and I want to be sure that I am making a smart and informed decision with my money. That's why I am reaching out to this community for some additional perspective and guidance.Do any of you have experience investing in Getty Images, or have you heard anything about the company that would make it a good or bad investment opportunity? If not, do you have any other recommendations for a smart investment opportunity that I should consider?

"Note: Copied it from someplace i dont remember a long time ago. FUTURE PREDICTIONS:In 1998, Kodak had 170,000 employees and sold 85% of all photo paper worldwide.  Within just a few years, their business model disappeared and they went bankrupt. What happened to Kodak will happen in a lot of industries in the next 10 years - and most people don't see it coming. Did you think in 1998 that 3 years later you would never take pictures on paper film again? Yet digital cameras were invented in 1975. The first ones only had 10,000 pixels, but followed Moore's law. So as with all exponential technologies, it was a disappointment for a long time, before it became way superior and got mainstream in only a few short years. It will now happen with Artificial Intelligence, health, autonomous and electric cars, education, 3D printing, agriculture and jobs. Welcome to the 4th Industrial Revolution. Welcome to the Exponential Age.Software will disrupt most traditional industries in the next 5-10 years.Uber is just a software tool, they don't own any cars, and are now the biggest taxi company in the world. Airbnb is now the biggest hotel company in the world, although they don't own any properties.Artificial Intelligence: Computers become exponentially better in understanding the world. This year, a computer beat the best Go player in the world, 10 years earlier than expected. In the US, young lawyers already don't get jobs. Because of IBM Watson, you can get legal advice (so far for more or less basic stuff) within seconds, with 90% accuracy compared with 70% accuracy when done by humans. So if you study law, stop immediately. There will be 90% fewer lawyers in the future, only specialists will remain. Watson already helps nurses diagnosing cancer, 4 time more accurate than human nurses. Facebook now has a pattern recognition software that can recognize faces better than humans. By 2030, computers will become more intelligent than humans.Autonomous Cars: In 2018 the first self-driving cars will appear for the public. Around 2020, the complete industry will start to be disrupted. You don't want to own a car anymore. You will call a car with your phone, it will show up at your location and drive you to your destination. You will not need to park it, you only pay for the driven distance and can be productive while driving. Our kids will never get a driver's license and will never own a car. It will change the cities, because we will need 90-95% fewer cars for that. We can transform former parking space into parks. 1.2 million people die each year in car accidents worldwide. We now have one accident every 100,000 km, with autonomous driving that will drop to one accident in 10 million km. That will save a million lives each year.Most car companies may become bankrupt. Traditional car companies try the evolutionary approach and just build a better car, while tech companies (Tesla, Apple, Google) will do the revolutionary approach and build a computer on wheels. I spoke to a lot of engineers from Volkswagen and Audi; they are completely terrified of Tesla. Insurance Companies will have massive trouble because without accidents, the insurance will become 100x cheaper. Their car insurance business model will disappear.Real estate will change. Because if you can work while you commute, people will move further away to live in a more beautiful neighborhood.Electric cars won’t become mainstream until 2020. Cities will be less noisy because all cars will run on electric. Electricity will become incredibly cheap and clean: Solar production has been on an exponential curve for 30 years, but you can only now see the impact. Last year, more solar energy was installed worldwide than fossil. The price for solar will drop so much that all coal companies will be out of business by 2025.With cheap electricity comes cheap and abundant water. Desalination now only needs 2kWh per cubic meter. We don't have scarce water in most places, we only have scarce drinking water. Imagine what will be possible if anyone can have as much clean water as he wants, for nearly no cost.Health:  There will be companies that will build a medical device (called the ""Tricorder"" from Star Trek) that works with your phone, which takes your retina scan, your blood sample and you breathe into it. It then analyses 54 biomarkers that will identify nearly any disease. It will be cheap, so in a few years everyone on this planet will have access to world class medicine, nearly for free.3D printing: The price of the cheapest 3D printer came down from $18,000 to $400 within 10 years. In the same time, it became 100 times faster. All major shoe companies started 3D printing shoes. Spare airplane parts are already 3D printed in remote airports. The space station now has a printer that eliminates the need for the large number of spare parts they used to have in the past.At the end of this year, new smart phones will have 3D scanning possibilities. You can then 3D scan your feet and print your perfect shoe at home. In China, they already 3D printed a complete 6-storey office building. By 2027, 10% of everything that's being produced will be 3D printed. Business Opportunities: If you think of a niche you want to go in, ask yourself: ""in the future, do you think we will have that?"" and if the answer is yes, how can you make that happen sooner? If it doesn't work with your phone, forget the idea. And any idea designed for success in the 20th century is doomed in to failure in the 21st century.Work: 70-80% of jobs will disappear in the next 20 years. There will be a lot of new jobs, but it is not clear if there will be enough new jobs in such a small time.Agriculture: There will be a $100 agricultural robot in the future. Farmers in 3rd world countries can then become managers of their field instead of working all days on their fields. Agroponics will need much less water. The first Petri dish produced veal is now available and will be cheaper than cow-produced veal in 2018. Right now, 30% of all agricultural surfaces is used for cows. Imagine if we don't need that space anymore. There are several startups that will bring insect protein to the market shortly. It contains more protein than meat. It will be labeled as ""alternative protein source"" (because most people still reject the idea of eating insects).There is an app called ""moodies"" which can already tell in which mood you are. Until 2020 there will be apps that can tell by your facial expressions if you are lying. Imagine a political debate where it's being displayed when they are telling the truth and when not.Bitcoin will become mainstream this year and might even become the default reserve currency. Longevity: Right now, the average life span increases by 3 months per year. Four years ago, the life span used to be 79 years, now it's 80 years. The increase itself is increasing and by 2036, there will be more than one year increase per year.

"Some of the bagholders will not like reading this, but Elon hype is dead, it's over. I am sorry but this is it. You know how stockmarket works, once a hype is gone it's gone. Nobody will ever believe him again. Even if he goes to Mars now, or sends 100 tesla to the orbit, doesn't matter. He will be remembered as doge scammer, pump &amp; dumper, liar etc. his ego has taken over his identity and morality.Look, majority of humans have this weakness that when large amounts of money enter their life, they lose their minds. They become arrogant, power-hungry, lose humility, their very identity and morality. They start to play mini-God and surround themselves with yes-man, and if their mini-God status ever gets challenged, they go mad and not shy away to use illegal ways that they did not use at the beginning of their story.Just look around you. I am sure you have a couple friends who become rich from a lucky hit on stockmarket, family inheritence or through early bitcoin or some other way. I am not exaggerating, 99% of the time you will see same story happening. The guy that was your best friend years ago that you could argue any subject no longer tolerates to hear you oppose them anymore. He has more money so in his mind he is more ""successful"" so that makes him ""right"" on everything. He no longer seeks friends who tell the truth to their face, he seeks people who admires his supreme intelligence and supreme decisions.I admired Elon Musk when he had Mars landing presentations etc. people believed he is the new kid on the block with crazy ideas for humanity's progression. I admired Bill Gates before he became the vaccine lord and started to dictate how people should live their lives. I was a Binance user for a long time and I admired CZ. CZ is no longer same person as first time Binance was launched. He has a very similar story like many others that started humble and promising, only to end up as corrupted as any other dictator.Bottom line is that: Do not over-idolize anyone, not Warren Buffet, not Vitalik etc. anyone I mean anyone regardless of how genius or humble they seem today. Very very few people don't lose their minds when large amounts of money enter their life, and props to those who still keep their feet on the ground. But at the end everyone is just human and prone to same weaknesses. That is why history keeps repeating itself over and over again.If by chance that you do get rich one day from this capitalism's game of stonks remember where it started and remember who was with you when you had nothing.

As soon as everyone gets on board with anything in the market, the opposite happens. #2: everyone thinks Santa rally isn’t happening, which once again is exactly when it strikes.#3: The Tesla price drop that occurred over the past couple weeks is the biggest downward move Tesla has made without a rebound since it’s all time high. A rebound, even if it’s only a day or 2 long, is coming.

I've wanted nothing but to earn enough money to pay off debts help my family and show him that stocks and crypto are a real way to earn a living. Not slaving away at a 9-5 or manual labor job. I want just one investment to go right so I can finally get the respect I've so badly wanted.

They don't want saviors they want evil perpetrators that will continue to cause chaos. Alas that is not who I am.

"At this point, I believe Tesla is undervalued. Although their revenue is significantly lower than other companies with a much lower mkt cap, their value isn’t in their revenue. It is in their tech investment and patents. I still think TSLA has a ways to fall, but any entry around this price is a good long term play.

I plan to reference back to these throughout the year. I want to wait personally until the week of January 9th to open any long plays. For me I still believe that Apple, Msft, and Google are the best play. However, I honestly worry about how strong MSFT is and that it could actually hold up the best in a long drawdown.    If I had to pick right now I would get SPY, Apple, Google and maybe Amazon puts. Netflix, adbe, nvidia are just too price already. And despite the probable Tesla downfall I wouldn’t buy it without some sort of 20-30% relief bounce first.    https://preview.redd.it/ok7tt5a6xi8a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4a2a06aa45f70fcbfbc9ea8d48f43dc5fe4ca6c0Well SPY continues to be hella frustrating… Last week I mentioned with the daily 8ema rejection and break through 378 we should have and were setting up to see a bigger push down to 360-370. However, as you can see put in some really strong support at that 379.6 area and we have not been able to break that down. With that big bounce and breakout with bullish engulfing candle on Friday one would have suspected we were going to see 386-390 today. Even looking at futures overnight which were up 0.7% at one point one would have suspected a bigger move up today. However, we found that 383 actually was a very strong resistance area that we couldn’t quite break through. Taking a look at this chart we have a generalized range of 379.6 to 386.3. however, when we look at the last 5 trading days besides December 21st we actually have a tighter range of 383 to 379.6. Todays hanging man candle actually formed a nice triple top at 383 too. Depending on the structure of tomorrows candle we could also turn this into a evening doji star pattern (bearish pattern). I have referenced my favorite diamond pattern many times before. This is about as tight of a diamond pattern as we could get (futes has it too). The way I see it that we either open over the blue support line of 382.2 (+0.2%) or we open under the red resistance line of 380.4 (-0.3%). I expect tomorrow to (and overnight) to establish the next 2-3 day move on SPY. If we break the blue support line then we are likely to see 378 retested and if that fails im looking at 370.6 by EOW Friday. If we breakout through the red resistance line (and more importantly the daily 8ema) then I will be eyeing a 386 to 390 retest by EOW. &amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/6wsb91w6xi8a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=719ad8e623df616a0b4a01cc293ddc1d6e851d43Taking a look at Futures we are in the exact same pattern as SPY daily. This nice big diamond pattern here. With this opening of the futures daily candle we have officially broken the support of the diamond pattern. Key resistance of this pattern is 3872.  I am eyeing next key consolidation level of 3845. We have bounced off this 3840 to 3850 support area 6 times in a row now. It is a very strong support area. If we lose that support its going to signal a pretty strong downturn. 3805 is the next major support.

Full on death to tesla is 27.8 which on current weekly trajectory we could be there by January 2024.I really wish tesla would have one big meaningful bounce so that I could trust entering some puts on it. I just cant in good conscious despite how puts for the last  month were free money on tesla… buy a put at these levels. But I also think buying a call is straight wasting money. I mentioned based on trend that we might get a 4th red week on Tesla before 1-2 weeks of consolidation. &amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/grya1529xi8a1.png?width=609&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f7dca592f67cac02a750ec83b4b1de0655959cd4The VIX continues to be absolutely detached from reality. IT appears to be a trend now that we get a pretty impressive spike on the VIX over night and then pretty much from 10am till 2pm we see the VIX unwind every day which then pushes us up. There are some impressive wicks to the upside on the VIX. We did close back over the daily 8ema support but once again failed to close over the daily 20ema. Market wise (as in price action and technical on SPY) I would favor a break down to 370 this week vs. a breakout to 390 this week. However, the VIX tells a more bullish story. However, I personally and maybe this actually is a 0dte everyday issue am seeing the VIX either being artificially suppressed or we are seeing the new calculation of the VIX with these 0dte everday being impossible to follow. **Daily Log-**&amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/jp1q7xi9xi8a1.png?width=813&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b5bf160daf57c8923acbdd6f1dea99643055c1d7I felt like today reminded me a lot of Friday in that we had absolutely no sense of direction and no continuation.

I mentioned based on trend that we might get a 4th red week on Tesla before 1-2 weeks of consolidation. &amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/2frfe6eswi8a1.png?width=634&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b00f47ba8fc18d7f7355731839b59434d9985a9The VIX continues to be absolutely detached from reality. IT appears to be a trend now that we get a pretty impressive spike on the VIX over night and then pretty much from 10am till 2pm we see the VIX unwind every day which then pushes us up. There are some impressive wicks to the upside on the VIX. We did close back over the daily 8ema support but once again failed to close over the daily 20ema. Market wise (as in price action and technical on SPY) I would favor a break down to 370 this week vs. a breakout to 390 this week. However, the VIX tells a more bullish story. However, I personally and maybe this actually is a 0dte everyday issue am seeing the VIX either being artificially suppressed or we are seeing the new calculation of the VIX with these 0dte everday being impossible to follow. **Daily Log-**&amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/luc5azuswi8a1.png?width=813&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f655a2e3266f994a5c63faa3b7fac6d2cc502b6I felt like today reminded me a lot of Friday in that we had absolutely no sense of direction and no continuation.

"This stock is way too expensive going into the 2023 recession.  “The housing market was very overheated for a couple of years after the  pandemic, as demand increased and rates were low. The market needs to  get back into a balance between supply and demand.”  “For the longer term, what we need is supply and demand to get better  aligned so that housing prices go up at a reasonable level, at a  reasonable pace, and that people can afford houses again,” Powell said  after September’s Fed meeting. “We in the housing market probably have  to go through a correction to get back to that place.” USAFed will continue to raise rates at a moderate pace. I think we all know a pivot is off the table and J Powell said he wants a correction in the housing market. The US will ultimately sink into a recession by Q1 or Q2. This will mean a lot less houses are being build from higher mortgages and a lot less new construction overall. South AmericaAll South American countries are dealing with high double digit inflation, very little prospects for growth in 2023. ChinaTheir housing market is in complete collapse.

"That day was December 12, when it rose from $159 to $162. Otherwise, it’s been on a straight line down, from $178.40 on December 1 to $139.40 today.

"TLDR: NVDA, AMD, overbought, TSM, INTC oversold with limited downside +5% dividends on INTC and 2.39% dividends on TSM**Tech macrosector analysis:**Crypto GPU mining is essentially dead, killing the ""gaming"" market for both NVDA and AMD, with INTC largely unaffected. ""gaming"" revenue accounts for roughly 40% of NVDA's and AMD's revenue. Although if we factor in forward looking trends, there is significant investment in INTC for manufacturing within USA, while NVDA/AMD still rely on TSMC for chip production, this can significantly boost the revenue and outlook of INTC if supply chain issues continue with the global trends looking negative with international relations with China being largely negative. Although TSM has invested in manufacturing plants within the US, it's questionable if it can support the current volume demand or future volume demand for the west. One advantage NVDA has is its GPU market share dominating the AI space, with its GPUs being the predominant brand used for AI research and DIY at home use. As AI tech picks up steam, we may see NVDA's forward looking revenue improve within the next year or two. AMD lacks both manufacturing investment advantage as well as a growth outlook for AI sector, therefore I am most bearish on AMD from a technological innovation standpoint.**Fundamentals**:EPS:Stock| EPS | 3-YR Qtrly EPS drawdown| 3-YR Stock Drawdown | current P/E ratio---|---|----|----|----NVDA | $0.27 | 77% | 57% | 60xAMD | $0.04 |  97% | 59% | 38xINTC | $0.25 | 87% | 62% | 8xTSM | $1.78 | -283% (growth)| 45% | 13xAlthough initially the price drawdown for INTC may seem fair given the quarterly EPS decline, I believe the significant drawdowns on INTC is due to investment into manufacturing plants and processes within the USA, which I believe will pay off in the coming years compared with NVDA and AMD. TSM drawdown seems unjustified given the continued increase in EPS through the economic downturn, although we may see a drawdown at some point if macroeconomics worsens, TSM remains a strong bet as semiconductors will always be in continued demand for the foreseeable future. NVDA and AMD are extremely overvalued from a P/E ratio standpoint, as a ton of growth and hype was priced in given their exposure to cryptomining and technical outlook vs their competitors, but I believe AMD is falling behind in both processor and graphics vs Intel and NVDA. I believe both AMD and NVDA has significant downward price momentum to reduce their P/E ratio to be more in line with the macroeconomic outlook and improve their realistic evaluations.How I would play the market:**Long side:**If you want to take a long position or positions with minimal downside through the continued macroeconomic uncertainty, I would invest heavily into INTC and TSM as these both continue to perform in terms of dividends and have P/E ratios that are very reasonable. Plus they also provide significant dividend returns even while stock price dips. I would take a lesser position in TSM if any, due to uncertainty with China, but if you want exposure to any upside from NVDA and AMD, it may be better just to take a position in TSM rather than either NVDA or AMD, as any demand growth from them will be passed through to TSM.**Short side:**I believe NVDA and AMD both have significant drawdowns in share price to go. Given the P/E ratios of both companies, I have taken short position in NVDA multiple times since Q4, but I also do not believe that the 97% EPS drawdown is priced in for AMD either.**Current positions:**Out of the above mentioned, I hold:Long: 600 shares INTCShort: 10x 130P 17 FEB 23 NVDANone of this is investment advice, not guaranteed to be accurate, DYOR, I hold no liability, I wrote this for entertainment purposes only. etc. etc.",Let's talk chip stocks - what's still oversold and overbought in this macroeconomic shitshow.,1,self.wallstreetbets,zwoinz,Lmitation,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/zwoinz/lets_talk_chip_stocks_whats_still_oversold_and/,1672171168,3775,93,14,630,0.063,0.846,0.091,0.9423,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

It's not a fad or a trend that's going to go out of style.In addition to being a necessary household item, toilet paper also has some interesting investment potential. It's a physical product that can't be easily replaced by technology, so it's not subject to the same risks as, say, a tech stock. And with the recent pandemic, there was a shortage of toilet paper in many places, which caused prices to rise.

" [S&amp;P Corelogic Case-Shiller Index Continued to Decline In October - Index Announcements | S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices (spglobal.com)](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/index-announcements/article/sp-corelogic-case-shiller-index-continued-to-decline-in-october/) The National Index declined for less than forecast and less than previous month. Part of my thesis for 2023 is that inflation will prove stickier than expected. Many expect tremendous relief due to ""housings"" total value in CPI, PCE. Variables:* The labor market continues. Has it slowed. Yes, but from a torrid pace. Surrounding data points (JOLTs, initial jobless claims, unemployment, jobs, wages) remain nominally robust as measured against the most recent labor market cycles (2000s, 2010s).

While savings rate has gone low, it's still positive, and there remain excess savings from COVID (JPMorgan did a report that they expect that to run out in summer/fall of 2023)*  [National Mortgage Database (NMDB) Aggregate Data | Federal Housing Finance Agency (fhfa.gov)](https://www.fhfa.gov/DataTools/Downloads/Pages/National-Mortgage-Database-Aggregate-Data.aspx)  According to FHFA 85% of homeowners with a mortgage have one at less than 3.5% interest. *  [Microsoft PowerPoint - ReportData\_template.pptx (newyorkfed.org)](https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/interactives/householdcredit/data/pdf/HHDC_2022Q3) People make a lot of the nominal amounts of household debt. But they don't seem to look at the status of the debt and households economic status. High credit scores, higher limits on credit cards vs total credit card (i.e. plenty of available credit), total balances of delinquencies rates which remain as low as they've been since the 90s, HELOCs were taken very low so homeowners have lots of equity, transition to delinquency remains at low levels going back to the 90s, and all categories (like mortgage deliquencies) remain below pre COVID levels (except HELOCs). *  [Existing-Home Sales (nar.realtor)](https://www.nar.realtor/research-and-statistics/housing-statistics/existing-home-sales)   [United States - Existing Home Sales: Months Supply - 2022 Data 2023 Forecast 2013 Historical (tradingeconomics.com)](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/existing-home-sales-months-supply-fed-data.html)  Traditionally, 6 months of existing home supply represented a balanced market. We can see the current supply remains far below that. Conclusion:My opinion is still the same. Inflation will prove stickier. Housing will remain high. People who build homes turned that off, existing home listings remain way down, the balance of supply to the market is low. People do not have to sell their house because they are employed, gaining income, and have savings. Household debt is in fantastic shape and consumers can easily withstand increases in it. The labor market continues to favor employees to switch jobs, demand better wages. Therefor, the Fed will keep rates higher until it causes the labor market, consumer spending, housing, to turn appreciably negative (shallow recession). It won't cut the rate unless the recession turns ugly. Black Swan:China COVID. Who knows how the supply chain gets disrupted, the level of global infections could be higher than ever seen, it could spawn a new variant that is more deadly, more contagious, evades prior antibodies better. If that caused a pull back, leading to recession, inflation will come down, Fed could pivot.","S&amp;P Case-Shiller Home Values Decline Less Than Expected, First National Data Point on Sticky Home Prices?

"We acknowledge that a risk-off market environment has pushed regards back toward benchmarks during the last two years, disadvantaging autistic strategies that focus on disruptive innovation for those with sensory overload difficulties inherent in poor gene selection over past generations of familial regarded relations. While innovation solves problems and typically gains traction during difficult times, some companies may be cutting back on research and development and other investments to build cash as a buffer against the fallout from higher interest rates.  Fear of the future is palpable these days, but crisis historically has created opportunities.  According to the latest BofA Fund Manager Survey, cash levels have not been this high since the 9/11 crisis in 2001, and regards are overweight bonds for the first time since April 2009. In December, the CBOE equity put/call ratio surged above 2.0, the highest level on record, surpassing the ratios in both the tech and telecom bubble and the Global Financial Crisis. In hindsight, both of those times were terrific opportunities to put funds to work in highly differentiated ways. To the extent investors have reserves of cash to put to work, ARK believes that this time will be no different and that innovation strategies will be prime beneficiaries when equity markets recover.  But remember there is always time for regarded degenerates to lose money.  So as ever do not be a fool and follow market indicators like money making wall streeters, instead pour more money into ARK funds like the reliable regards you are.  As you can see from our shill letters, ARK Invest is focused on the commercialization of regarded new technologies during the next five years and into the future as long as I can keep the spigots on.  I will say the future looks good in this regard as there are always truck drivers, postal workers, tech bros and Wendy’s employees (both front and back of house of course) to fatten our funds and buy the furniture I need for my Hamptons, Vineyard and Bay area homes.  In our final newsletter this year, we feature the likely proliferation of early-stage regard screening tests that ensure new blood weekly, artificial intelligence as the “assembly line” that will boost regard worker productivity dramatically, and the accelerated pace of rocket launches and space exploration for virgin regards thanks to private sector participation and Wright’s Law. As many know, ARK has centered its research on Wright’s Law, which differentiates our regarded strategies. I do not believe that you will find this kind of research in most traditional financial institutions as they do not cater to regards, highlighting ARK Invest’s role as a diversification strategy for asset allocated regards.  With many thanks for your support of ARK and the innovation that we believe will solve problems and transform the world in profound ways,  Cathie",A Holiday Message from our Fearless Regarded Regard - Ms. Cathie 'Regard' Wood,1,self.wallstreetbets,zwlc2s,27onfire,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/zwlc2s/a_holiday_message_from_our_fearless_regarded/,1672163115,2917,78,13,478,0.081,0.772,0.147,0.9879,0.0,0.616,0.384,0.6808
