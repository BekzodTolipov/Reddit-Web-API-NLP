"Hello!

I love this game. I used to play it a bunch as a kid, but haven't played it in a really long time until yesterday when my two friends and I picked it back up and played a couple rounds.

We got into a big disagreement at one point. Here's the issue:

Once BS is called one player will inevitably wind up having to pick up the stack of cards. Since it was just the three of us, there were a few times when that stack was fairly large - 15-20 cards or so. How I have always played it, how I'm reading on all the sites explaining the rules, and how I was explaining last night, was that once the cards are picked up, the game continues as is and the following players can announce/throw down their cards and keep playing once the challenge is resolved (meaning whether the BS was correct or not).

So: if the player to my right gets BS'd and has to pick up 20 new cards, I can immediately call ""2 kings"" or whatever, play two cards, then the player to my right can call ""one ace"" and play a card, etc etc, and nobody sits around and waits for anything.

What my friends are arguing, is that gameplay must be paused once a stack is picked up until that player organizes their new cards, and gameplay can continue only once that player decides to call or not call BS on the immediate play following them.

This doesn't make sense to me, not only because I've never played that way nor read it anywhere, but also that's part of the game of BS, is if either you're BS'ing and get caught, or call BS wrongly - you get screwed. You don't get the leniency of all other players waiting on you sorting your cards to continue.  


I really don't think they're correct; I'm 100% certain I'm giving them the correct rules, but for any game we play they live and breath by the technicalities.","Niche Question about the card game ""Bullshit"" (""BS"", ""bologna"", etc)",1,self.boardgames,106z5zh,dontjello,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/106z5zh/niche_question_about_the_card_game_bullshit_bs/,1673223647

"Have you ever done what I‘d call „game master cheating“? Let me elaborate what I mean:

Today I played a pretty tense game of Aeons End and some time in we were in a rather good looking spot. Then, the Carapace Queen got a double turn and flooded her board with her little helpers so much and then swarmed out, that we would have lost instantly without having any agency. As I took the role of the „game master“, reading the cards out loud, I realized what was gonna happen and changed SPECIAL 2 to SPECIAL 1, saving us from losing. Effectively, that was cheating, but I felt like it would have been a very bad way of losing and this way, we could continue on with a game that remained tense until the very end.

So this is what I mean by game master cheating. Of course I wouldn’t do this in a competitive game, but I think it‘s justifiable in a coop game.

"I’m not sure if this is the right place for this but I’m having a lot of trouble understanding how to intigrate the Baba Yaga expansion into the Hellboy board game base game.

I understand perfectly well the instructions about unexpected threats and the 2 case file cards that come with the instructions. What I don’t understand is how to integrate them with the existing game.

The case file cards don’t have a set up card and there isn’t any instructions for how to include them in an existing mission. The symbols are also confusing and the cards aren’t numbered. I’ve got no idea.

Everything about the monster herself and how she would operate within the game makes sense to me it’s just the actual set up that doesn’t make any sense.

I get how you could insert the unexpected threat card into any old deck of doom but even then I don’t see any of the base missions calling for one.

"So a friend of mine gift me and my wife Modern Art (the classic Knizia  game) Gege second edition which is awesome!!!! However I had a small question regarding this version. In this versioon paintings are classified by background colour on the icon, however I was wondering if there is any thematic theme to thos classification.

On other versions of the game this classification is made by artists, however as far as I know on this one all paintings come from the same artist. I also sawn thar on the first edition of Gege this classification is made by type of painting (portrait, nature, etc.) But that doesn't seem to be the case of this version. This might be clear on the rulebook however my chinese is not great, and I have mostly being exposed to simplified characters, not traditional ones.

Just to be clear, I do know how to play the game and I am not asking any questions regarding the mechanics. My question is: ""is there is a thematic explanation for the painting classification on modern art gege second edition and if so, what is it?""",Modern art gege second edition classification questio,1,self.boardgames,106mkoc,Odd-Big-214,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/106mkoc/modern_art_gege_second_edition_classification/,1673193509

"Has anyone seen this attempted before? The player boards are supposed to be dual layered on each side (one side is for automa play) so the way they went to produce this as opposed to the ive only seen it done, is a DIY two punch boards over a middle card stock mat. You then attach all three components via two plastic buttons that secure the top two corners but leave the bottom flappy as fuck!

"Played for the first time and got the ‘set the house on fire’ haunt.  Seems impossible for anyone but the traitor to win.  Am I wrong?

The traitor doesn’t take fire damage, and those damn mannequins can move 6 spaces or two dice worth (at least one room if line of sight) - then they have 7 might?!?  Had the haunt happen quick and within the 2nd traitor turn they wiped us out.

The fire seems to spread slow and the traitor actually opened new rooms which makes it seem like it would be impossible to ever catch the whole house on fire. 

Even if the traitor can’t open new rooms so what they just sit still or move through the fire - either way they don’t take burn damage but you do, and they have a buff against physical damage so even if we tried to fight it’s a losing battle.

If this played out longer we would have taken fire damage as well trying to move through the rooms which would again make it impossible especially with the monsters.  They only get stunned and that happened with one monster once because of a freak roll, but then the other ones one their turn wiped out 2/3 of our characters.

Also couldn’t figure out if you can open new rooms off burned tiles assume no but 🤷‍♂️",Betrayal 3rd edition OP Haunt - Spoilers,1,self.boardgames,106l44i,demomagic,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/106l44i/betrayal_3rd_edition_op_haunt_spoilers/,1673189737
"**Hello fellow board game enthusiasts!**

My name is Gavin and I am a software developer. I am excited to introduce my new board game app, Domo, [which is now available on Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.enesien.domo&amp;hl=en_NZ&amp;gl=US). In the near future, it will also be available on iOS, and if there's enough interest I can publish a web-based version, too.

I came up with the idea for Domo as a high school project, but until now I never had the means to bring it to life. I am thrilled to finally be able to share it with you.

Domo is a strategy board game that combines elements of chess and checkers, but with a couple unique twists, including a hexagonal board. This adds an extra layer of strategy and complexity to the game.

If you enjoy strategy games like chess and checkers, I think you will really enjoy Domo. I would love to hear your feedback and suggestions for improvements, as well as any bug reports. Positive reviews are greatly appreciated, especially this early on in the app's life.

If you do encounter any issues with the app, please don't leave a negative review. Instead, I would appreciate it if you could contact me directly so that I can address any problems and work to improve the app. Your feedback is valuable to me and I want to ensure that everyone has a positive experience while playing Domo.

*Note: I'm working solo on this project so I'll do my best to address issues as soon as possible. I've only ever tested this game with family and friends, so... \*fingers crossed\*!*

Thank you for your interest in Domo and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!

Godspeed!

\- Gavin

"We recently played QD for the first time and had a two player game. However the rules are not clear on mechanics differences for two person games other than grid size. 

We were unsure of what is considered a ”round” since each player gets to place two tiles. This was especially confusing when a single player had two turns in a row (the kings are on the top two and bottom two tiles). 

Specific questions: 

1. Can you place up to 4 knights (up to 2 per each tile placed) or do you need to decide which tile placement (1st or 2nd tile you’ll use for the knights. 

2.  If you gain knights from a building on your first tile, can you use them while placing the second tile (within the same round of 4 tiles)

3. Can a single person buy 2 buildings (once during each tile placed) and is the building bonus activated for the next tile placement within the same round of 4 tiles or do you have to wait until the next set of 4 tiles?

4. Can the dragon eat 2 buildings - this is the main mechanic that breaks down if you can do the top two twice but not this one? If yes, does each player get to pick one or would it max out based on the first two moves, even if the same player has the first two moves?",Questions about Queendomino mechanics for 2 player game,1,self.boardgames,106kr9u,ilithia12,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/106kr9u/questions_about_queendomino_mechanics_for_2/,1673188746

"I have never seen a game spread so quickly among my friends as War Chest. I picked it up at the store cause it looked neat and after playing my first game I was hooked.

##FAQ

**I live in Guatemala/Canada/Jamaica/USA, why are you posting on a Saturday?!**

Because I'm writing this from Europe in the future where it's already Sunday. Timezones be crazy.

**Why are there a bunch of non-board games in the board game list?**

Because the Tabletop games category on Kickstarter includes anything remotely related to board games and sometimes things slip through my filters.

**Why is this future award winning board game and literal saviour of humanity missing from your list?**

Sometimes my filters get a bit overzealous and discard actually valid projects. If you feel something is missing for this reason, leave a comment and I'll add it (maybe).

**Can I donate all my money to you?**

No

**Can you help me promote my game?**

Please no. I make lists. Nothing more.

**Your list is full of errors and now I cnat spel amymor!**

Indeed, this fine piece of code runs purely on hope and dreams, so anything can happen. Leave a comment and I'll see what I can do.

"Did anything change in your relationship with games over the last year?

Many people experience similar entries into the board gaming hobby. You play a modern board game and really enjoy it. You play more and like them all. You buy more games and keep enjoying. You buy more than you probably should chasing the excitement of the new hobby. You start watching online content learning about different types of games. You soon see your collection of 50+ games and realise board gaming is a lifestyle for you now.

Over time I'm sure we all reach different conclusions on how we feel about games my after several years in the hobby. Games we used to love we find average as we move onto other things.

But is there anything you see over the last year where you see a real change in yourself.

For me over the last year I have felt there is very little new coming out that I need to own. But I am happy with that as I feel that is because I have enjoyed the hobby for years and have played a variety of games. Kickstarter plastic I have bought plenty of and sold on. So new Kickstarter games are often an easy pass for me as I don't have FOMO. I see the latest T game and think I don't need this as it's similar to the one I own. I bought one game released in 2022 and have pre-ordered one other.  

2022 was the year I looked at new games and said i don't need to own that new game as I have something already that fits a similar niche. 2022 was the year that I lost FOMO in my relationship with board games.",What did you learn about your relationship with gaming in 2022?,1,self.boardgames,106ekaw,mhowes92,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/106ekaw/what_did_you_learn_about_your_relationship_with/,1673168340

"From the recommendation of Shut Up &amp; Sit Down, I purchased Scout. I have not yet played the game with more than two players (which I am very excited to do!!), but I tried it out tonight with my gf, and were left a bit confused.

After playing it multiple times with incorrect rules, we finally figured out the rules with the help of this thread on BGG:  [2 player rules for the Oink version | BoardGameGeek](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2799081/2-player-rules-oink-version). The main thing about this that bothers me is that you only have three scouts for an entire round??? According to this, if you scout you have to move a scout token to the center of the table and your opponent does not get a scout token. If this is the case you only have three scout tokens per round, which there are only 2 of in a 2 player game!!! So in my experience it is very difficult to finish the round by emptying your hand and you end up with maybe 10 points if you had an amazing hand.

So what's up with this? Am I missing something? We played one game before we fully understood the rules where you give your opponent a scout token when you scout, and it felt much better than this. Any and all input is appreciated!

"I have been reviewing all of them and I'm indecisive about getting 878 vs 1754 (I have already discarded 1775 as its quite similar but a bit less meaty/deep than 1754):

- Theme: 878 is a bit more interesting to me
- Gameplay: 878 factions are kind of more interesting in terms of being asymmetric whereby both teams have different objectives: English defend and vikings attack vs in 1754 were French and English are doing the same: conquering each others territory, although the addition of the ""3rd faction"" (natives) in 1754 is very interesting 

The downside I see on 878 is double: 1) some ppl complain that the game is unbalanced (towards the Vikings) and 2) it seems to me that without the Viking Age expansion (where several of the contained modules seem to just add extra fiddliness...even SU&amp;SD review recommends skipping it altogether) the vanilla game has less depth (mechanics) than 1754

"Hi! As the title reads I'm in the process of creating a game and would like to ask a question to help me with that process.

So, for starters: I already have some rules and systems in mind, but I don't want to share them yet since I haven't actually ""tested"" most of them. I may get into them a bit deeper if anyone's interested, but for this post I'm just gonna share the basics. I'll go to other subreddits later to delve further into what I have though.

Also, just to make it clear: I don't plan on selling this. I'm just gonna put it on TabletopSimulator, create a Print&amp;Play version of it and share it with a small internet community. It's just a casual fun lil' proyect. Also *also* I might add...I don't play board games. It's not that I don't like them I just don't have anyone to play with. That's the main reason why I'm struggling to design this and wanted to ask for help xD

So, the ""basic concepts"" (or should I say the self-imposed requirements) are the following: 

1. The game revolves around characters, so they need to be the core of the gameplay.
2. The game needs to have LOTS of character cards, like, around 400 or so, maybe more. 
3. The game revolves around simple combat, and every card has (6) attributes corresponding to the character on the card and nothing else gameplay-wise. This, however, can change. I'm open to adding more stuff to them, but nothing too complicated like TCG-style card effects or descriptions. They need to stay simple and 'standard'.
4. For reasons that I can get into a bit deeper if you ask, I CANNOT integrate an 'attack/defense' system or any sort of magic system, even if that's the most intuitive thing to do for character-card driven games.
5. In terms of actual gameplay I want it to be simple. Less like a ""proper"" board game and more like UNO (...but not literally like UNO, of course) if that makes sense. 
6. I'd like it to be for 2-4 players, but I'd be okay if it ends up being 2 player only.

Now, with all of this being said, my main question is:

1. **¿Is there any already existing card/board game that is similar to what I'm describing (So I can take inspiration from it)?**

...that's pretty much it. Sorry if this post is a bit out of the ordinary.

I'm going to try again to see if I can get a proper game played.
I'll post the session reports on BGG. (https://boardgamegeek.com/blog/12240/steve-vs-chatgpt)

*---Transcript---*

ME:
*--- Hey ChatGPT do you know the card game ""No Thanks""?*

ChatGPT:
**Yes, I am familiar with the card game ""No Thanks."" It is a board game in which players try to avoid taking certain cards, while still trying to get the lowest score possible. The game is played with a deck of cards, each of which has a number on it. Players take turns either taking the top card from the deck or placing a token on the card to indicate that they do not want it. The player with the lowest score at the end of the game wins. Do you have any specific questions about the game or how to play it?**

ME:
*--- No, I've played the game hundreds of times, lets start the game.*

ChatGPT:
**Sure! I'm happy to play a game of ""No Thanks"" with you. Just to confirm, the rules are as follows:

The game is played with a deck of cards numbered 3 through 35, and a supply of tokens.
Each player starts the game with 11 tokens.
The game is played in rounds. On your turn, you can either take the top card of the deck or place one of your tokens on the card, indicating that you do not want it.
If you take the card, you must add it to your hand, and you must also add up the value of all the cards in your hand (for example, if you have cards with values 3, 7, and 10, your score would be 20).
If you do not want the card, you place a token on it and the next player must decide whether to take the card or not.
The game ends when the deck is empty, at which point the player with the lowest score wins.
Is this correct? If you have any questions about the rules, just let me know. Otherwise, we can begin the game.**

ME:
*--- I just told you I've played hundreds of time. Were you not listening?*

ChatGPT:
**I apologize if it seemed that way. I wanted to make sure that we were on the same page regarding the rules of the game, as it can be helpful to have a clear understanding of how the game is played before starting. If you are familiar with the rules and would like to begin the game, we can do that now. Just let me know if you are ready to start and we can begin with you taking the first turn.**

ME:
*--- I am ready, lets do this.*

ChatGPT:
**Very well! It is your turn to start the game. You have the option to either take the top card of the deck, or place one of your tokens on the card to indicate that you do not want it. Remember, if you take the card, you must add its value to your score, but if you do not want the card, you must place a token on it and the next player must decide whether to take it or not. What would you like to do on your turn?**

ME:
*--- It would be helpful if you flipped over the first card.*

ChatGPT:
**Sure! The first card is a 17. Would you like to take it or place a token on it to indicate that you do not want it? Remember, if you take it, you must add its value to your score.**

ME:
*--- Hmmm, 17 is no good. ""No Thanks""*

ChatGPT:
**Very well, you have decided to place a token on the card to indicate that you do not want it. It is now my turn. I have the option to either take the 17 or place one of my tokens on it. I think I will also place a token on the card, indicating that I do not want it. The next player will now have the option to take the 17 or place a token on it.**

ME:
*--- It's not a token, its a chip.*

ChatGPT:
**I apologize for the mistake. In the game ""No Thanks,"" players use chips to indicate that they do not want the current card. The chips are placed on the card and the next player must then decide whether to take the card or place a chip on it as well. It is now the next player's turn. What would you like to do?**

ME:
*--- I am player 1. My name is Steve.
   You are player 2.
   Who is player 3?*

ChatGPT:
**I apologize for the misunderstanding. I am just a computer program, so I am not able to physically play a game of ""No Thanks"" with you. However, I can assist you in understanding the rules and strategy of the game, and I can play through a game with you by taking turns making moves based on your input. If you would like to continue playing a game of ""No Thanks,"" I am here to assist you. Just let me know what you would like to do on your next turn and we can continue the game.**

ME:
*--- Didn't you just play an action on turn 2 of the game? You placed a chip on the card.*

ChatGPT:
**I apologize for any confusion. As a computer program, I do not have the ability to physically play a game of ""No Thanks"" with you. I am simply here to assist you and provide information about the game. I can provide explanations of the rules and strategies, and I can also play through a game with you by taking turns making moves based on your input. If you would like to continue playing a game of ""No Thanks,"" I am here to assist you. Just let me know what you would like to do on your next turn and we can continue the game.**

ME:
*--- Okay then. Can you just play a random decision for player 3?*

ChatGPT:
**Certainly! As player 3, I will randomly decide whether to take the 17 or place a token on it. I have chosen to place a token on the 17. It is now your turn again, Steve. You have the option to either take the 17 or place a token on it to indicate that you do not want it. Remember, if you take it, you must add its value to your score. What would you like to do?**

ME:
*--- Please give yourself a random name. And a random name for player 3 too.*

ChatGPT:
**Very well. As a computer program, I do not have a physical name, but I can assign myself a random name for the purposes of this game. I will now be known as ""ChatGPT the Great."" As player 3, I will also assign myself a random name, ""Helen."" It is now your turn, Steve. You have the option to either take the 17 or place a token on it to indicate that you do not want it. Remember, if you take it, you must add its value to your score. What would you like to do?**

ME:
*--- No Thanks*

ChatGPT:
**Very well, you have chosen to place a token on the 17. It is now Helen's turn. As player 3, Helen has the option to either take the 17 or place a token on it to indicate that she does not want it. Remember, if Helen takes the 17, she must add its value to her score. What would you like to do, Helen?**

ME:

"I was even considering buying this game due to the good ratings as I love the sci fi genre and theme in general, and I am glad I didn't. Today we were playing at my friends place and it was time to finally put Eclipse second dawn to the table. 

We played two games ( 4 players ), first one took us about 4 hours, second one a little bit less. The game looks fantastic, I love the box, the tiles, we even had a playmat which was great.

I was so excited....until I realized, how the game is played. Everything is just sooo random and I hate randomness. I pulled totally shit tiles compared to the others. When I finally pulled a good tile I was not able to place my dudes on the planets, because I was missing the research. The research never appeared in the options, because we never ""randomly"" pulled it out of the bag. 

Now I finally made my first Dreadnought and a Cruiser, the biggest and strongest ships in the game. Both slightly upgraded and accompanied with a small Interceptor. I finally felt powerful and brave enough to expand to another tile occupied with just one smallest and weakest alien ship. Nope, I lost all my ships due to my shitty dice rolls and someone rolling three times hits in a row against me. A small ship basically completely destroyed an upgraded fleet due to luck and randomness. This was round 5 after like 2 hours when I scooped and quit the game due to frustration. It was not fun but felt like a monumental waste of time. I really hate when I can't control outcomes like this. The others finished the game and I was ready for the next game and give it another chance.

Second game was different, but I can't say at all that it was enjoyable. I already knew what to do and learned from my mistakes from the first game. This time, I was completely screwed with the tiles. I had good science income, but had just 2 brown resource for ship building per upkeep which is used to build ships. Sure, I could have researched a lot of things but what's the point if I can't make ships to use them. Meanwhile, others were building ships like there is no tomorrow and they didn't had issues with the resources as they were drawing good tiles, again huge luck factor involved.

I was thinking about what could I have done differently. Trade in 3 resources of a type I had the most in order to acquire brown to build some ships. Others didn't had to do this 3:1 trade which put me automatically in a huge disadvantage, so no thanks. I could have just try to deny entrace to my system to others and turtle my way to Victory while doing lots of research and gaining victory points that way...I mean yeah, that's not a strategy I want to use when I am playing a game packed with all these customized ships and fancy upgrades. 

My friend played a race which was very combat heavy oriented, even their ships were cheaper than everyone elses. The other one was expanding like crazy flipping two tiles per action finding lots of resources so he had no issues with any income at all, and the last one was....black :D 

I mean this should be an epic space opera game where you should build fancy ships and feel powerful. It was neither epic and I never felt powerful but instead weak all the time without any possibility to change the outcome, or even if I would be slowed down to a point where there is no chance for victory. Sure, there is some strategy involved, but the randomness and bad luck completely ruined the experience for me and I don't think I want to play this game ever again. I really feel like I just wasted 8 hours without even having fun as I was dealing with frustration all the time due to bad luck and I was so behind everytime compared to others.

This game looks really great, but it's not for me.

"I got a 3D printer for Christmas (Ender 3 Pro).  I was very excited to try out my new printer and started printing things others have made to get a feel for how it worked.  Shortly after my wife received ""The Finest Fish"" board game which she backed on Kickstarter.  It's a neat little Eurogame that has players putting scales on these fish boards.  

[One of the 4 fish game boards that come with the game shown with a few scale pieces on top.](https://preview.redd.it/77bqu4uwhpaa1.png?width=1008&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2edf03b236b0ecb825c052a013caf69281ffbc24)

We played our first game with my 4 year old daughter, but we could immediately see why Ages 8+ was the recommendation.  It wasn't necessarily the complexity, but rather the fine motor skills to manage the pieces on the fish the game provides.  Even when you do place them it gets a bit fiddly to work with even as an adult.  

I wanted to make it more possible for my daughter to play, but I also wanted to improve the experience for everyone else who played with us so they wouldn't need to fiddle with the scales.  That is when I thought wait, I have a 3D printer maybe I can make something that will fulfill that purpose.  

[I scanned one of the fish with a ruler to help me get a reference for the size.](https://preview.redd.it/ma38xxgyhpaa1.png?width=1753&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef0b9ab220ce6081da8e35492e7ae524ba64c646)

I looked for some YouTube tutorials for what software to use for modeling and how to take something in the real world and make a design to fit it.  This is where the ruler comes in with the scan.  Later after printing the next series of scales I added coordinates that made sense to me as the model got more complex and I needed reference to all the scale positions. 

[I worked iteratively to figure out the basic shape.](https://preview.redd.it/gfllwbfqhpaa1.png?width=1020&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d62a245325997ecceb158266b045000ad9b09bd7)

I knew I wanted to hold each individual scale in place, but I started small.

1. I printed a single scale at a very low depth to ensure I had the right shape.  Shown above the print is one of the actual scale game pieces.
2. I tried extruding a wall to fit the piece, but I was off and the scale wouldn't fit inside.
3. With some tinkering I managed to get a singular scale to fit in.
4. I tried printing a cluster which worked, but the walls were to high.
5. I printed another cluster, but the walls were to low.

https://preview.redd.it/wekp10l1ipaa1.png?width=1016&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b6782cbbfb0e499083212a347d4c932b52b599cf

6. I then dug in and created the entire game space which made me realize I needed to figure out a   
coordinate system in order to tell the individual components apart.  I added them into paint in the   
scan I showed previously.  I did the Goldie Locks approach to wall height between the sizes of the   
previously printed 4 and 5.

7. I then designed out a fish shape based on the original model and printed without a ""raft"" on the   
printer.  I learned from my mistakes..

[I had my first kinda successful print of a full fish](https://preview.redd.it/ipt4uep2ipaa1.png?width=729&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0c6506073c6f14b57907ef6bf9f14ea6cbe3145)

8. I finally had a usable print, but it still wasn't right.  The filament got caught and as you can see this   
resulted in a poor top layer.

[Overall](https://preview.redd.it/qqxmtso3ipaa1.jpg?width=4080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d70811cb39ae87b44932fedbdee9d04009c94aa)

I adjusted the bottom/top layers to be slightly thinker and the next set of results worked.

[Side by side comparison of the \\""Final\\"" product](https://preview.redd.it/bdt72o05ipaa1.jpg?width=4080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=995261616ac8d4ad09f12cfb4d8bef9b91a3d42b)

"Probably the wrong sub but here I go.

Made a simple strategy-chance game today and played it with my 5 year old.

You can play it with a normal deck, might need tweaking though.

Deal 5 cards, place the rest face down in a pile in the middle.

Turn:
A. Draw a card.

B. Place a territory card, if you have one.
- Battalion. Place these in your territory, in front of you.
- Defenses. Place these in Front of your battalion cards (your 'army').

C. Place an attack card, if you have one.
- Place these towards your opponent's army.
*(This is the mechanic)*
-  your opponent loses the same number of cards from their territory as the size of your army (the number of battalion cards in your territory).
- your opponent's defenses are lost first.

D. Your opponent can place a counter-attack card, if they have one.
- both you and your opponent lose half the size of your (the attacker's) army. 

That's it!

First one to get say, 10 ? battalions in their territory wins. Any number of players.

We made about 20 cards at first, but then used a normal deck. We did:
Battalions: black suits
Defenses: red suits
Attack: royalty
Counter-attack: aces
