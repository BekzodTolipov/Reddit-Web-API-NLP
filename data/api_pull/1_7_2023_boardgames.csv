"If I wanted to play a virtual board game remotely with someone who didn't have a great PC but could still Zoom/Skype, what would you recommend? Any direction you can provide would be massively appreciated.

Here's the scenario I'd like to discover a solution for:

* A roleplay game I can essentially DM on one side - She says ""Let's move here"" and I can adjust the tokens on both turns. One person has to be able to control the board
* Something with a cool interface and nice visuals would be splendid

"Context - I recently got into marvel legendary and have picked up a bunch of expansions.

- Xmen
- Civil War
- Secret War 1
- Secret War 2
- Guardians of Galaxy

"Whilst playing Teotihuacan, I came across this royal tile: “Score 2 victory points each for whichever is lower: your position on the pyramid track, or the power of the locked worker.”

I’m not actually 100% sure what this means. 

Let’s say your locked worker has 3 but you’re at 2 on the pyramid track, would you score 2x2=4?

Or you’re at 5 on the pyramid track but your  locked worker has a power of 3, you’d score 3x2=6?

Looked into MoM and betrayal on the hill, liked the ideas, but the first one cost almost a minimum wage in Brazil and the match is way too long. Betrayl, on the other hand, looks more noob friendly, but im afraid because its too controversial, a lot of hate and love, and its not cheap here, like 500+ reais (minimum wage is 1200 reais).

"So I am busy developing a system where I use a set of dice to control the perimeters of a player in a game that requires more players than are present. At the moment I am tailoring it towards Catan, specifically because its usually only two of us in the house playing board games (I am aware that there are a few 2 player rule variants for Catan, but im personally not a fan). Basically the idea is that a dice (different kinds of dice, usually a d4, d6, d10, and d12 for catan, and then a d20 to decide specific hexagons for different actions like pregame placing or robber placing) is dedicated towards each action and decides for the third ""player"".  


Pre game = Roll dice to decide where on the board settlements and roads will be.   
During game = Roll normal catan dice &gt; Distribute resources &gt; Roll dice to decide wether the ""player"" will trade or build or both. Using dice to decide what that player wants to trade and with whom. As well as what direction the the player wants to build in if building a road. so on so fourth, you can see how it can get complex. 

Basically I wanted to ask if this is an actual thing among the boardgame community, are there any tried and tested systems or is it just a thing of coming up with a system that suits the game at hand?

To play, you split into two teams and pair up with someone from the opposite team. When it’s your turn you and the person you’re paired with pull a card with a common place or thing listed (like “Eiffel tower” or “pepperoni pizza”). Your goal is to get your team to guess the word or phrase by giving them AS FEW clue words as possible. If I think I can get my team to guess in 5 words I say this aloud. The person I’m paired up with then has the opportunity to decide if they want to try to steal the play by having their team guess with only 4 clues or if they want to let us play. It goes back and forth with the number of said clues going down until someone lets the other team play. If the word is guessed correctly the team gets a point.

"**A trick-taking round-up of fifteen-ish trick-taking games**  
I came to trick-taking games a few years ago after someone showed me how to play Wizard while visiting my girlfriend at the time. I was pretty much exclusively playing Magic the Gathering, D&amp;D and the occasional game of either Love Letter or Eldritch Horror at the time, and I was positively blown away by how good the system felt. I’ll talk more about Wizard below, but trick-taking as a mechanic has consistently felt rewarding and satisfying, mostly because of the absolutely bonkers amount of twists that designers have managed to put on the system. It has inspired me to design two trick-taking games of my own, which I will absolutely not bore you with here. So, let’s take a deep dive and a clower look at just the twists and turns that designers have managed to put on the system.  

Now, I would like to preface this by saying that this is obviously not a comprehensive list of trick-taking games. If you want to know or see more in-depth stuff on trick-taking games, I highly recommend looking up Taylor’s Trick-Taking Table on Youtube. Taylor is personable and really knows his stuff when it comes to these games. Besides trick-taking games, I will also take a look at two ladder-climbing/shedding games that people may not know but that I feel are worth talking about in this context as well. I will also only be talking about games that you have to buy in a store, rather than games that you can learn online and play with a standard deck of cards. Lastly, and most importantly, I won’t be going in-depth on the rules for these games mostly in the interest of time. I respect that you’re probably not looking to read 100.000 words, so I’ll try and keep things brief. If something sounds interesting or compelling, I highly encourage you to look up the rules and see for yourself if it’s something you’ll enjoy.   


**What are trick-taking games?**  
Trick-taking games, in case you haven’t yet had the chance to play any or haven’t seen the term before, are likely the oldest games played with a deck of playing cards. Historians have found evidence of trick-taking games being played in China way back “in the early part of the second millenium”. Trick-taking games are usually played in rounds where players get dealt a hand of cards, which they then play one by one into a center ‘pot’ in smaller rounds called ‘tricks’. Tricks are usually won by the player who played the card with the highest value, who would then collect the played cards and typically plays the first card into the next ‘trick’. After having played most or all of the cards in your hand (depending on the game), you will then assign scores to players based on the rules of the game. This can be ‘victory points’ (like in games of Tarot, Pinochle or Bridge) or ‘penalty points’ (like in Hearts). There’s also some terms or mechanics that come up often. Many games feature bidding of some kind (where players have to guess how many tricks they will win before playing their hand in order to score points), a trump suit (where a specific suit in the game will beat other suits when evaluating the winner of a trick) and a process called following. Following means that other players are forced to play a card of the same suit (or type) as the first card played in a trick. That first card (called the lead card) is also usually the card that determines the suit of card that will win the round (assuming there isn’t a trump suit).   

Many different cultures have their trick-taking games, to the point where different provinces or cities within the same country, like an accent to a language, can play by different rules when playing the same game. One example is the game Klaverjassen (known as Klaberjass outside of the Netherlands), a game that has had ebbs and flows in popularity here in the Netherlands. Klaverjassen has different rules for certain key aspects (like when you get to play trump cards) depending on if you play according to Amsterdam or Rotterdam rules. There has long been a feud between these two cities (transcending way beyond the rules for Klaverjassen), which you can even see when you talk to people about which of these two rulesets to follow. My father, having grown up in Rotterdam, will call you a jackass if you play by Amsterdam rules, while those people will call him a heathen for using Rotterdam rules. I love it when I see these small cultural aspects rhyme; the rules you follow, in some senses, can be directly linked to your cultural background.   

Hopefully that little anecdote was not just interesting to me. Let’s talk about some trick-taking games.   
  

**Trick-taking games:** – discussed in alphabetical order    
  
**Cat in the Box (in collection):**  
Hook: what if you got to choose the colour of all the cards you play during a trick-taking game?  

In my top 40 games list, I talked about how Cat in the Box felt like it was more concerned with being an interesting game rather than a fun game, and I still sometimes ponder over how important I think that is. The gameplay really does feel very fresh and different and compelling, but that does come at a price; Cat in the Box has a pretty difficult teach for a game whose ruleset really does get out of the way once you actually start playing. If players are familiar with some core principles of trick-taking games (following suits, trump suits, ‘breaking trump’, making bets) it really isn’t all that difficult to play. The thing that pretzels your brain, then, is determining when you follow suit or when you declare that you are ‘out of that colour’ in order to win a trick. It’s a fascinating game that unfortunately is hampered by a pretty rough teach and what will likely be a first play that hurts your brain. I recently brought it to a game day and most of my friends (who were familiar with trick taking games) said that this was their favourite game of the day. An impressive feat, considering we also played Oathsworn. Recommended for people who are already familiar with trick-taking games or who are willing to stick through a tough teach and first play.  

**Claim (in collection):**  
Hook: what if your game had two halves, and you play the first half to get cards for the second half?  

I played so many games of Claim last year, because it’s quick, sweet and immediate. It’s a quick five minute teach (even to people who don’t know how trick-taking works) before you’re off to the races. The two part structure of the game (where you play one hand in order to get cards you’ll use during the second half of the game) is pretty briljant. Smart players will be able to track cards that were played and that they expect to see in the other player’s hand, while more tactical players (like me) still get to have a fighting chance. There’s also something quite satisfying about being able to spin a trash first hand into gold during the second half, where you’ll score almost all of your points. Most people I’ve played it with will very quickly start shorting suits or otherwise use the public info to their advantage, and I’ve also seen hands where people were able to turn absolute train-wrecks into winning hands. I’ve got the mini tin version with me in my bag wherever I go, because it’s so easy to just whip out and play with anyone. If you’re looking for a two-player trick taking game, this is the one I recommend most.  

**The Crew (Space version in collection):**  
Hook: what if you worked together with outer players to complete certain goals without being able to talk?   

So if Wizard was my introduction to trick-taking, The Crew made me fall in love with it. I got rid of The Mind after playing this for the first time, because The Crew manages to really accomplish the melding of the minds that people who play The Mind try to achieve. There’s nothing really like managing to fulfill some of these impossible-feeling missions using nothing more than some cards on the table, and that look of pure determination while you’re playing as you see someone lay down just the card you needed in order to bring home the gold. However, I will say that I may have played too much of The Crew, and the magic trick it does has started to wear thin for me. That isn’t to say that The Crew is a bad game – I don’t begrudge a game feeling a little thin after I’v eplayed it thirty times. That does however diminish just how enthusiastically I react when someone asks me to play it though, as I would rather play most anything else at this point. It turns out I like talking too much. Even if I don’t play it that much anymore, I highly recommend it for people looking for a great co-op game or for people wanting to learn trick-taking.   

**The Fox in the Forest (no longer in collection):**   
Hook: what if you played a dueling game in which you can only win a certain amount of tricks?   

I absolutely adored The Fox in the Forest, but I unfortunately don’t own it anymore. That’s not because it’s bad – people just didn’t want to play it with me anymore. The interesting thing about Fox in the Forest is that you want to hit a certain sweet spot with your score at the end of a hand. Win too many tricks and you’ll not score any points. Win too few, and your opponent will walk away with most of the points up for grabs that round.   

The thing that really struck me about The Fox in the Forest, besides its gorgeous artwork, was how well they managed ot pull off a two-person trick taking game. I now like Claim more for its immediacy and smooth on-ramp, but Fox in the Forest is really inventive and the puzzle in figuring out when to win and when to start losing games is really very stellar. Not my favourite two-player trick-taker anymore, but one I will happily play whenever someone asks me to.  

**The Fox in the Forest Duet (not in collection):**    
Hook: what if you wanted to play The Fox in the Forest, but wanted to work together like in The Crew?  

So TFitF Duet is the baby borne from The Crew and The Fox in the Forest proper. The end result has the same great trick-taking mechanics from the original, but instead has you work together with your fellow player in order to win specific tricks in specific places without being allowed to talk about the cards in your hand. I ended up really liking my plays of it, but I did come away from them preferring to play The Crew instead. People kind of malign The Crew at two players, but I really did like my plays of the two player game because of the interesting puzzly aspects that come from having a public hand. Duet changes this formula up by not having a public hand, and instead having you care about ranges of cards and winning in order to reach specific spots on the board. Very enjoyable, but only recommended if you really want a two-player cooperative trick-taking game and don’t enjoy the two-player mode in The Crew.  

**Gorus Maximus (not in collection): **  
Hook: what if the trump suit could change during the hand and only some cards score either positive or negative points?  

So let’s talk about the elephant in the room first. Gorus Maximus’s artwork is an acquired taste. I personally love how much it leans into its ridiculous theme, but I can understand people being put off by just how bloody and over the top gory it is. If these mechanics sound interesting but the theme puts you off, I would recommend looking into Sea Change, which is a reskinned version put out by the publisher “for people with kids” (as said by their booth representative at Essen).  

Gorus Maximus does a cool thing by allowing players to change the trump suit mid-trick. Players have to follow the lead card, unless they wish to play a card of the same rank as the last card played. When you do this, you change the trump suit to the suit of the matching card. You get some very wild swings from this, which I like, although I feel that other players prefer the more metered and organized nature of more classic trick-taking games (as having a fixed trump suit means you get to make more accurate evaluations of your hand’s strength when you’re dealt it). The fact there’s also cards that have negative points for whoever wins them will also mean that people who don’t like meanness will also bounce off of this game. I like games that allow you to play more tactical rather than strategic, and I don’t mind meanness in my games (so long as they’re not just pure take-that), so I can consistently have a good time playing this game! There’s also something very satisfying about managing to dance around all the negative points, or (just like in Hearts) managing to feed all of them to the player who was in the lead at the start of the hand. Very fun, but only recommended for people who can look past all three of Gorus Maximus’s red flags.  

**Jekyll v.s. Hyde (not in collection):**  
Hook: what if you played a dueling game in which both players want to meet different scoring goals?  

I don’t really like Jekyll and Hyde that much. I’ve played it a bunch of times on Boardgamearena, and I haven’t lost once. That’s probably because I’ve only every played as Hyde, who has a much easier time (I feel) than Jekyll does. Hyde wants to have as much of a difference in score as possible, whicle Jekyll wants the scores to be as similar as possible. That sounds a lot more interesting than it is in practice, as I feel that the Jekyll player really does have a much more difficult task to fulfill than the Hyde player does. I don’t see why you would play this over Fox in the Forest, unless you’re really drawn in by the theme. That isn’t to say that Jekyll vs. Hyde is a bad game; there’s a reason I kept coming back to it. At the end of the day though, I feel that the puzzle given to you by Fox in the Forest is more rewarding, more complex and has more longevity.  

**Joraku (in collection):**  
Hook: what if your trick-taking game was also an area control game?  

I’ve talked about Joraku at length in my review earlier last year, but the main thing I want to stress is just how good Joraku feels. The changing nature of the trick-taking evaluation along wiht the area control fight on the central board feel great, and the two systems (one part trick-taking, one part area control fighting) complement each other surprisingly well. If you like trick-taking and area control games, I cannot recommend this game enough. It is one of my favourite games right now, and barely anyone has heard of it.  

**Shamans (no longer in collection):**  
Hook: what if your trick-taking game was also a hidden identity game?  

Shamans has a special place in my heart for being a merger of two of my favourite mechanics (trick-taking and hidden identity) – so much so that it was the subject of the first review I’ve ever written. Which unfortunately means it hurts even more to say that I have sold Shamans and am not really looking to play it ever again. While I stand by the things I said in that review, I unfortunately found out that the magic spell that Shamans tries to cast is much more fragile than I thought at first. The problem you run into is that there really isn’t that much information being given out during the trick-taking game, and the fact that the roles change each hand means that there isn’t that much forward planning or long-term engagement happening while playing. I was really and genuinely hooked the first four times I played it with people, but I kept getting more and more blasé responses whenever we were done. People felt like they didn’t have much to go on, that they weren’t able to pivot well enough if their hand was trash, and that the betrayals that would happen late game weren’t hilarious and shocking (like I felt they were) but were instead a product of the hidden identity element of the game being half-baked. And the thing that hurts most is that I had grown to agree with them. I love Shamans still, for just how pretty it is and how enchanting my first few plays were, but I don’t ever really want to play it again.  

**Skull King (in collection):**  
Hook: what if your trick-taking game was bonkers and hilarious?  

Skull King, without much competition, has created some of the most uproarious games at my table. It is absolutely hilarious. The betting in Skull King has some of my favourite moments in gaming, where you see people anguish over their bet while others are full of bravado immediately, and then you see those expressions flip almost immediately once the bets are revealed. The fact that the game also keeps getting more and more difficult as the game goes on (due to the ever-increasing hand size) is great as well. I tend to do well in the first half of the game before being goozled by my own hubris in the second half. It’s dumb in a good way while still managing to go out of its way to make sure actual skill is rewarded. I’ve barely won any games of this, but man do I like coming aboard for the ride. Highly, highly recommended for people who like trick-taking games but don’t want to play something very serious.  

**Tichu (in collection):**  
Hook: what if your game was fantastic?  

On the other side of the coin, we have Tichu. Tichu is the only team game on this list, and I would argue that Tichu is the most serious game here. Tichu feels like a lifestyle game, and would arguably be the one game I keep if I was only allowed to have one single card game in my collection. That said though, Tichu is very difficult (for me at least) to get to the table; surprisingly so. The rigid player count and importance of balanced teams makes Tichu actually pretty fragile for how good it is. The inclusion of bombs and the evaluation of when you want to call Tichu is also very counter-intuitive for players, so you end up with a game that needs to be played multiple times before you can start to see its full potential. Of these games, it is the game that I feel takes the most time to fully appreciate. But, and this is key, it is also the game that will most reward you for taking that time.  

**Tournament at Avalon (in collection, along with Tourney at Camelot)**:  
Hook: what if everyone had a game breaking superpower and got more as the game progresses?  

Okay back to something dumb again. Tournament at Avalon is a highly ridiculous game, but in a different way than Skull King. Where Skull King is hilarious in its hubris and its swings of luck, Tournament at Avalon is funny in the sense that it is funny to see your friends trip over something on the sidewalk. Which you put there. Again and again. Tournament at Avalon finds itself in the rich history of games like Hearts, where winning the trick is *the bad thing actually*. So, of course, you see players conspire together in order to make sure that the one player who is winning gets goozled to mostest and is forced to take all of the damage cards while everyone else gets off scott free. What elevates this game over Hearts though is the inclusion of ridiculous player powers and, like the venerable Mario Kart before it, the fact that it allows players to rubber band back into the competition by the inclusion of Godsend cards. The end result here is a game that feels much less like an examination of the Bayoux Tapestry (like its artwork suggests) and much more like a folio by way of Monty Python. It’s Cosmic Encounter if it made out with a normal deck of cards.  It’s mean, its hilarious and it doesn’t pretend that it is fair. If that sounds even partly up your alley, I highly suggest looking into this game.  

**Wizard (no longer in collection):**  
Hook: what if your trick-taking game was bonkers and hilarious but not as wild as Skull King?  

Let’s not beat around the bush, Skull King is this game dialed up to eleven. 95% of the things I mentioned earlier are true here still, expect that Wizard is not as wild and swingy. There’s no reason for me to suggest Wizard over Skull King in a perfect world, although I do realize that Wizard is probably much more accessible to people than Skull King is. My preference is clear here, but I would never dissuade someone from picking up Wizard. The fact that it is very accessible and likely easy to acquire are some very strong points in its favour. Plus, shout-out to my main man Steve going for a jog in his pink kilt on the red 2 card.  

**Shedding/ladder climbing games:**  
Shedding/ladder climbing games are very similar to trick-taking games, with the key differences being that the main goal is to empty your hand (rather than win points by winning tricks) and the fact that you often don’t have breaks in turns after people have played a single card but instead go round and round the circle of players until everyone has passed before you start a new trick. However, considering that these games often get lumped together I still felt it prudent to talk about these games anyway.  

**Maskmen (in collection):**  
Hook: what if all your cards don’t have numbers and you determine their value by playing tricks?  

Maskmen is one of my favourite games to bust out with people who are at least a little familiar with trick-taking games. The initial reveal of showing them a deck of cards without numbers and then explaining the mask totem pole that will spring into being by them playing cards together is always very rewarding, and I love the point where I see people go “oh so that’s how this works” before they absolutely whip me to next week. Hard to acquire, but one I cannot recommend enough to people who are familiar with the core mechanics of games like this that also like seeing the weird and fun directions it can go.  

**SCOUT (in collection):**  
Hook: what if you didn’t get to rearrange your hand, but luckily each card has two numbers on it?   

SCOUT is a fascinating game of hand management and controlled shedding, where you do some suboptimal plays here in order to set up some great plays in the future. Even though SCOUT doesn’t formally have bombs in the same way that a game like Tichu or Haggis has bombs, there are most definitely plays in this game that feel the same way. I’ve also talked about how SCOUT, despite its colourful artwork and circus presentation in the Oink version, feels like a card game that could be played at a smoke-filled cards table in some obscure backroom. It’s another one of these games that doesn’t exchange rewarding skill for accessibility. I would recommend this game to pretty much anyone except people who are very unfamiliar with card games or who are very uncomfortable with games like this. It’s immediate, engaging, pretty and makes you feel like you’re actually doing something. That’s a weird thing to say about a game, but I hope you catch my drift.   

And, fun fact, it is one of only three games on this list that I get active requests for from other people. I’ll let you figure out the other two.  

**Tichu again (in collection, still):**  
See what I wrote above. It’s true regardless of which of these categories you would put it under.   

**Conclusion:**  
Hopefully you've gotten to see a glimpse of what this genre of games has to offer. I'm personally very excited to keep exploring just how deep this genre is, and I am consistently excited to see what else people manage to come up with. Discovering the Japanese board game scene has been a blessing and a curse in this regard, but I am still eager to delve deeper so long as I can find people to come along with me on this journey. 

Also, feel free to drop any recommendations you may have for games that you think I should check out! I'm always on the look-out for new things to try, so if you think there's something worth trying out I'm very eager to know. Thanks for reading! Now to some brief bonus content.

**Games I'm still waiting to play:**
First on the list are three games by Taiki Shinzawa. Specifically Ghosts of Christmas (which I own but haven't played yet), Planet etuC and American Bookshop (all backed on Kickstarter, but they haven’t delivered yet). Taylor (of Taylor’s Trick-Taking Table fame) swears by this designer, and after having played Maskmen I’m chomping at the bit to play more. Maskmen is an absolute gem (even though it’s arguably a shedding game rather than a trick-taking game, but I’m letting it slide) and it’s one of my favourite games to just bust out with people who are a bit more familiar with how trick-taking works to show them something weird and cool. Of the four listed here I’m currently most excited about American Bookshop because of how clean and simple it is, and I’m most intimidated by Ghosts of Christmas considering how much work it took to help players properly understand Cat in the Box (which seems to put an equal amount of “spin” on the trick-taking formula). 

Next, I’m waiting for For Northwood! to deliver as I’m always eager to try a solo trick-taker if it actaully centers around trick-taking as a mechanic. Plus, that artwork is to die for. I also backed for a copy of Maquis and Black Sonata, so I’ll be able to have some grand old times once that Kickstarter delivers. 

There’s also 535, a shedding game Kickstarted by Portland Games Collective earlier last year. This one looks really cool, mostly as an interesting take on a more pure shedding game with a smaller twist. I like the look and design, alhtough I will say that I’m sceptical about its longevity in my collection when I have to choose between it and games like SCOUT or Maskmen. We’ll see though, very eager to try it out. 

I’m also very eager to try out Inside Job, another game that tries to combine trick-taking and hidden identity. After Shamans didn’t really do what I wanted it to do, I’m hoping to try and see if Inside Job manages to scratch that itch more effectively. It looks like it has a more robust system wherein players get to do more deceptive things without the actual playing of the game being as fragile as Shamans. The things I’ve seen about it online looked promising, so here’s to hopefully finding something that plays as promising as it looks. 

Lastly, I’m also waiting eagerly to (hopefully) play Arcs at the end of this year. Arcs, to me, kind of feels like what would happen if you were to take trick-taking as a system and then stretch it to its furthest possible extreme. If you were to have told me that I would be eagerly awaiting a game that, if you were to be extremely reductive about it, amounts to Twilight Imperium meets Spades, I would have fallen off my chair. But its true, I am absolutely awaiting this with bated breath. Cole Wehrle, as both a designer and a developer, has done nothing but impress me. The campaign system sounds fascinating (and more rewarding than Oath, which I also like a ton) and using trick-taking to manouver space ships and win resources sounds fascinating. Can’t wait to get my hands on this. 

**Other card games I’d recommend if you like trick-taking:**
I’ve recently been consistently blown away by how good Parade is. Parade is a game of knowing when to be conservative and when to be greedy. The scoring at the end is always super tight (in no small part because you add two surprise cards to your pile at the end) and it really allows for players to be very very clever about how they utilize their cards. I’ve been bringing it to every game night since I got it because it is just that good. 

6 Nimmt/Take 5 and Hot Lead (grouped together here because they are similar enough) are games about trying to suss out your fellow players before playing a card that could either spell great victory or disaster. While 6 Nimmt is more about playing the right card in the right spot (or bidding for parking spots, as Shut Up and Sit Down so affectionately describes it), Hot Lead is a game about trying to be just greedy enough without having that greed blow up in your face. I love the kind of thoughtweft that appears between the other players as you start to understand just what the other people at your table are likely to do as the game progresses, and how you can get absolutely goozled by your own hubris. It’s great fun, and it offers a similar hand management/table reading skills as most trick-takers and shedding games.",A round-up of fifteen-ish trick-taking games,1,self.boardgames,1059e9m,DarkJjay,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1059e9m/a_roundup_of_fifteenish_tricktaking_games/,1673048373

"I hope this is ok for me to post here!

I used to play a game in the late 80s / early 90s (New Zealand, if that helps), that was a board game with marble mazes. It's driving me crazy because I cannot remember the name because we lost the box (and the game is long gone too).

It's like screwball scramble  but with four players I guess? Four different marble mazes, with the goal to add as many of your ""balls"" into the middle. The middle is a timer, with four holes to let the balls through, but there's a rotating plastic inside the timer that closes the gates in intervals. So you had to time the balls to go through the maze AND through the gate. Whoever got the most balls into the middle part won.

* Someone says on-your-marks-get-set-go.
* Both players read out loud the list of words.
* The first player to reach the end *wins* the word race.
* Pick a new word list from the menu, and race again.

**Rules**

* Read the words out loud, with correct pronunciation.
* If you make a mistake, repeat the word.
* If you don't know the word, just do your best.
* Reading at a loud volume is not the goal. Read at a comfortable volume.

**Play Variations**

* One player reads from top-to-bottom; the other from bottom-to-top. 
* For COVID safe version, play word racing outside standing 2 meters apart.
* Play in a tournament format taking turns with up to 8 players.
* Recommend using at the start of a meeting, class, or party as an ice breaker.

"So, I've submitted a post like this before. It's always a gem, at least for me. When I've been away from the hobby for a little bit and don't follow every new release, this is a fun thread to read. 

I wanna hear from you all what you think are the most truly unique games that have come out in the last 1-2 years. If you have one from 3 years ago that's fine but I'd prefer the newer side. Allow me to elaborate on my criteria:

- First of all, it has to be a GOOD game. I don't care if it's unique if the game stinks. 

- Not looking for a game that's very familiar feeling with one minor twist. For example, abandon all artichokes is a good game, no complaints. But suggesting that because ""this is a deck builder, but the goal is to thin your deck out not build it up, "" just doesn't cut it. After all, you DO build it up, plus deck thinning is out there, it just isn't the primary goal. 

- The game has to be either mechanically pretty unique, thematically unique (without a totally tired rule set), or it has to be something that just creates a really new experience for the players. The first time i played mysterium, i felt that way. Even we're doomed qualifies. 

Well that's it, can't wait to see what you guys come up with. And these don't have to be large games either. Last time someone suggested ""why first"" a micro game about coming in second place. That game is a trip every time we play it. Totally qualifies, even though it's a racing game because the experience of trying to come in second in various races to eventually come in second place overall, mind warping...ish...

"In my view, a game rated a 5 complexity has the widest net. You can't make a game like War (1), much simpler than flipping a card and comparing high value. You could, however, make a game like On Mars infinitely more complex.

A flaw with BGG's complexity rating system is that it's only in integers of 5. If I have six games, I have to put at least two in the same category, even if I don't believe any two truly belong together. For example, in terms of weight: On Mars &gt; War of the Ring &gt; Paladins of the West Kingdom &gt; Concordia &gt; Ticket to Ride &gt; Candy Land. 

To force these games into BGG's complexity rating, I either have to accept that there's a threshold for something being a 5 and anything above that threshold is a 5, or I have to call the heaviest game on that list a 5 and force something below it into a category I don't believe it really belongs in. To me, the former makes the most sense, but the weights on BGG don't really seem to reflect this.

"I explain board games, that's my thing. I believe I'm good at it and people tell me I'm good at it. When I got **Turing Machine**, I thought I would be able to explain it easily, and I can! The problem is explaining it in a way my fellow player will understand.

I have explained it to a bunch of people. Some get it instantly and are ready to venture in harder puzzles after a single game. Some struggle so much it's apparent they don't understand the game even after two full playthroughs of easy puzzles. And that's after explaining the game in 2-3 different ways to make sure they get it.

Since TM is a logical deduction game, players are expected to write notes in secret from their deductions. This can be a problem for game explainers, since you can't verify your fellow player understands the logical system during gameplay.

When browsing the forums on BGG, I found it odd how many people played a few times, only to find out they didn't really understand the game *after* they completed their games. They only *thought* they understood.

The rules have layers of complexity. There's the basic premise, the first order logic, the second order logic and non-mutually exclusive criterias. I've seen people struggle at each level.

It's such a weird game in the way its unapproachable for many people, yet it can be played in twenty minutes.

My go-to is **F the Dealer**. Very simple rules. 

The dealer grabs the deck of cards and looks at the top card. You then ask someone to guess what card it is (Aces low). Suit doesn’t matter. If their first guess is wrong the dealer says higher or lower and the other player has one more guess. If they get it wrong they drink the difference between their guess and the card itself.

If the player guessing gets it right on the first guess everyone chants “fuck the dealer” and dealer drinks 5 times. If the second guess is right the dealer drinks twice and there is no chant.

Our gaming experience is mostly just silly card games (Uno, Muffin Time, Exploding Kittens, CAH). I think that he likes the multiple steps for each turn, and that it is strategic but forgiving. I know this makes us clowns on this sub, but I was hoping we could get some recommendations of other games that have nice pieces/layout and similar game-play experience.

"This review is written for people who have never played the Skyrim computer game, nor any board game of this genre.

This is a story game about going on quests, and what to do if you are not yet strong enough to complete your current quests.  It is cooperative, but unlike some more commonly known cooperative games in which you play a character (Pandemic, Spirit Island) there is no initial goal about how to win, and your character will be asked to make decisions for which there may not be a best answer.

There is a main quest.  But you definitely are not ready for it at the start of the game.  So you need to do stuff to make your character stronger.  The main quest is represented by a box of hundreds of numbered cards that work like a ""choose your own adventure"" book.  Perhaps one of your current cards is a brief description of encountering a bandit, and it instructs to attempt or choose different options: you will draw different numbered cards from the box if you decide to fight the bandit, convince the bandit you are someone new to his gang, or run away.

[The Box of Numbered Cards, Like a Choose Your Own Adventure Book](https://preview.redd.it/yz3p70dcecaa1.jpg?width=2140&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c6224ad316607beaaca6527e0a6434312c86e44)

To get stronger you embark on up to two side quests at a time.  These are mostly found in decks from which you draw a card when you explore a city or explore in the wilderness.  These side quests are short and often reward you with new gold, equipment, or experience points that you use to buy ""skills"" that provide advantages in combat, ambush, diplomatic, or shopping tasks.  Some side quests also refer to numbered cards in that big box.  You can also see some small numbered cards I put in the front of the box above: those represent equipment you get from the quest's patron to help you succeed or (more often) as a concluding reward.

[You Find Side Quests in Cities and the Wilderness](https://preview.redd.it/6ey9jjegecaa1.jpg?width=733&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c934f8519b9a077512408b7f330fd0b8d95a3490)

If you are not yet strong enough for your side quests, then you travel to a nearby cave or ruins and fight a monster to take its treasure.  The game has clever rules that help ensure these places have a monster that provides an appropriate challenge and reward for your character's current state.  The fight will begin by giving you the option to try to ambush the monster, and if you decline some monsters will ambush you.  Then you repeatedly take turns where a red die with six different symbols is rolled to determine what the monster will do, and with that information you can pick how your character responds offensively or defensively.  The bottom of the monster card has symbols showing how much gold and experience you gain, and which decks of equipment you draw from as looted treasure.  Colorful cubes are used to keep track of the monster's armor and health as you fight it.

[Monster!](https://preview.redd.it/yvn35qrlecaa1.jpg?width=681&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=48a7f606e8cf2344faacffdfdf3175fde06b99b7)

That's the basic flow of the game.  There is a very large map on which you wander around, fighting monsters to get strong enough to do your side quests, and doing side quests to get strong enough to progress through the main quest.  All that fighting provides a way for everyone to cooperate, unlike simply reading a ""choose your own adventure"" book.

A big tray of tokens keep tracks of the stuff that will go on your character board: gold (used to get equipment), experience points (used to get skills), three colors of crafting materials (you balance spending these to reroll dice while questing versus using them to upgrade or enchant your equipment), little rectangles to keep track of which skills you have bought, and lots of small decks of cards that have equipment from various combat and shopping opportunities.  It is a lot of rules, but they flow nicely once you have played the included tutorial adventure.

[Stuff for the Good Guys](https://preview.redd.it/s9i8rpcnecaa1.jpg?width=2948&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff5030354c7bcf2cdee372033e9ffb5905fbe00e)

The game has handy boxes in which each player can put their character's stuff when it's time to clean up the table for dinner.  

[This is What Your First \\""Save Game\\"" Looks Like](https://preview.redd.it/bmj4fjzoecaa1.jpg?width=502&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f43eb900e9ebc483476962af1a6842fe52edbe4)

Another tray has the ""bad guy"" stuff.  There are six piles of cards to represent six different types of monsters.  (As mentioned above, these are not shuffled, but carefully arranged to have a little randomness but still provide an appropriately challenging monster.)  There is a pile of round ""threat tokens"" which represent things going wrong: when put on quest cards they show the quest is closer to failure, and when put on cities they show the city is becoming less helpful and with enough threat tokens the city will eventually act to hinder your plans.  (Where to put these threat tokens is one aspect of the game's choices that often lack obvious best answers.)  There are little diamond-shaped monster tokens to show where on the map a monster is wandering around.  And you also can keep the monster's die and armor/health cubes in this tray.

[Stuff for the Bad Guys](https://preview.redd.it/atpwdt3secaa1.jpg?width=794&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6ef3f40367116daa5d10d02e585ae7c1bd38fe3b)

You won't play the game for its story, which is not a high-quality novel.  The game can be played solo, but it really works best as a social experience.  You and up to 3 friends or family members are adventurers, exploring a fantasy world and getting stronger as you fight monsters and try to help the people who give you quests.  There are lots of choices to make that really change the story and the ways your characters develop, which gives the game a high replay value even if you have played it before and know some of the numbered cards for the main questline.

I did not include photos of the big board with its pretty map, of the plastic miniatures that represent where you are on that map, of the character boards, nor of the rulebooks and their summary cards.  I'm sure you can find those elsewhere online.

Last week I got to watch my teenage son play with his grandfather.  Neither had played this type of game before, but they both loved it.

They enjoyed talking about how to be an adventurer: when to find a monster in a cave, what equipment to buy/upgrade/enchant, when to pursue an active quest, when to let a quest fail.

They enjoyed talking about the decisions for improving their characters: should one specialize in using two-handed weapons because they were lucky in finding an amazing sword? should the other specialize in enchanting so both of them could more affordably have powerful equipment?

They enjoyed talking about tactics: which offensive or defensive options to use in various circumstances as they fought monsters or met tricky situations in quest cards.

It's a game for people who like talking about those things, either with others or inside their own heads.

At the start of the main questline there is no sense of urgency, which is delightful for encouraging exploration but might feel funny to people who are used to board games very focused on always looking for the ""right"" choices or tactics to ""beat"" some opponent or game-mechanic.  You are not ""lost"" about what to do.  You are merely a newbie adventurer who has yet to make a mark in the world.  None of the city's jarls, the regional's powerful wizards, or the leaders of strange cults or bandit gangs know your name or care about what you are doing.

I got Talisman on a whim, with very little knowledge on its gameplay, but it turned out to be great even though the only sort of ""non-classic"" or ""newish"" games I've played in recent years have been Exploding Kittens and Codenames. Basically, getting Talisman and having so much fun was kind of shocking. 

I'm a traveling teacher and one thing I've been happy to see is how popular game cafes are in different countries I've taught in. I always go in new ones at least once. However, I've never had a chance to really dig into a wider, more diverse selection of board games. 

But the future is looking interesting in terms of trying out some new games, and then sharing them with friends, family, and my students too.

"One of our favorite family activities is playing board games. We started homeschooling a couple of years ago and have been intentional about finding games that teach something, too. For example, this year we spent some time on biomes and food chains and the game **Ecologies** was really helpful in demonstrating those two concepts. We also occasionally play a quick game of **Chronology** as a history activity. 

We've searched this sub and other sites and found several educational games that my husband and I would enjoy but look too complicated for the kids still. Evolution, terraforming mars, high frontier, bios: genesis are all on our radar but probably only our oldest (almost 13yo) could play with us. 

So what are your favorite games with an educational component that is is suitable for 9-12 year olds? We'd love more science games, but any subject would be great. And if it's playable for even younger kids (without being mind-numbing for adults), that would be an extra bonus but not necessary.

"I recently got the second edition of the Robinson Crusoe game, and am going over the rule book and trying to study everything before trying a solo game myself. So far most of the rules seem to make sense to me, but there is one I've come across that I'm not sure exactly how it plays out:

It says in the rulebook for combat: ""Before combat, you can use treasures, starting equipment and special abilities to temporarily increase the weapon level"". 

My question is, Do you assign treasures, starting equipment or special abilities, BEFORE you actually see the hunting card and reveal it? The reason this confuses me is because the creator of the game answered on Board Game Geek someone elses question a while ago, that you ""cannot go back to the past"" when using special abilities, and things have to play out before you reveal them. I'll just copy and paste what he said about palisades on here:

&amp;#x200B;

""You can use skill anytime, yes. But you can not use it to go back in the past! If card say you deduct palisade, you can't move back in time, boost palisade and then resolve card.

you can boost palisade before drawing a card (anytime, true)  
You can't boost palisade after drawing card to apply effect before resolving card (travel in time) ""

\~ Ignacy Trzewiczek (BoardGameGeek 08/21/13)

&amp;#x200B;

My other question is, on that same page of the book talking about combat (page 16), it also mentions that combat can commence due to an event card, adventure card or mystery card, or the hungry animal dice. So if it's true you can only use the treasures, starting equipment and special abilities BEFORE, does this apply to all these situations as well? Where you'd assign them during the action, but before you reveal any of these cards, or that hungry animal dice roll?

Hey everyone!  I'm looking for recommendation on a story-telling based boardgame which is still good for 2+ players. I will mostly be playing it with 1 other person but it would be nice if it is enjoyable for 4 players as well (not a requirement though). 

I am specifically looking for a game that has a lot of replayability (+20 games before wanting an expansion) and something that you will come back to after beating it for the first time. Hopefully in the same vain as the ones I mention below, *not looking for a couples game.*

I did get some suggestions for the following games but I have concerns:

* This War of Mine -  I have heard that TWOM is great for single player but doesn't encourage collaboration (doesn't scale for multiple players).
* Arkham Horror 3rd Edition -  Not sure about the ""wanting to go back"" to Arkham Horror after beating it. 

I considered Sleeping Gods but it's just too long for a single playthrough, and Gloomhaven seems amazing but it's too big for the space I currently have. Open to any suggestions even if they are different to what I posted above!

**Number of Players:** 2-4

**Genre:** Story-Telling

**Game Length:** Less than 8 hours

**Complexity of Game:** Doesn't matter - prefer something that takes some brain power

" Hi all, was hoping to get help with a few rules that came up in our recent game of Caper: Europe with the Rome deck.

1. If The Don is the first thief played at his location, does the caper tracker get to move at that location or do you need to wait for the next thief to be played?
2. Does the last card discarded from each gear round count as a “discard” for the purposes of the game, enabling The Driver to move the caper tracker?
3. Can the pink card effects for winning the location stack at one location?

"First of all, 

Sorry for my bad English. I won't use Google translate to doing this. Feel free to pointed out mistakes or if it is not clear enough.

I just bought the game, me and my wife played 2 games and the rules seems incomplete to me. Or me and my wife are total idiots, that, could be true ;).

1- When you put a card on the board and that card starts a line. Can you put another one that is lower behind just to screw your opponents?

Ex: I put a 3 on the table and start building a line. Can I put a 2 or a 1 before the 3 now or I must continue with 3 as my starting line?

2-In the rules there's an example where someone used 2-3 middle cards from a different line to make another line. That, I understand. But could we use the starting and the finishing cards from a line to do another one or if the starting and finishing cards must only be used once?

"A few years ago (somewhere from 2018-2020 I think) I saw a news post on BGG about an upcoming game. As far as I know the game is still unreleased.

It was a co-operative (or semi co-op) game about demographics of people living in and navigating a city where their rights are being encroached on by an increasingly hostile government.

Gameplay involved point to point movement around a board representing public transport (among other methods), though the specifics of what else happened on the board I can't remember.

The main system were 4 tracks that each player had markers on. These represented 4 services that each player had access to that over time could be reduced or increased.

Transportation, Communication, Healthcare (?), and another which I can't recall.

Each player had their own position on these tracks which dictated what restrictions they had to work with. Players low on Transportation were unable to use certain paths across the board as they were barred from different methods of transit. Players low on Communication weren't able to trade items with other players as they were restricted from communicating on the same platforms.

All screenshots I saw were prototypes, though a version with more complete art might have been on the BGG page a year or two after it was up.

This all might be a bit vague but hopefully it jogs someone's memory!",Need help finding a game I came across a few years ago,1,self.boardgames,103splf,generic1253,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/103splf/need_help_finding_a_game_i_came_across_a_few/,1672903264
"For those of you who want to get your money back or hold Peter Blenkharn accountable, this guide is for you. Please do not dox or threaten Peter Blenkharn- it is contrary to the goal of refunding your money and accountability/transparency. Be factual and provide relevant detail. Please do share this on the comments section of ITB’s other KS and FB pages (Alba, Aquanauts, Crypt X, Sub Terra II, and Newspeak) if you’re a backer and it’s not already there. The more people do this the more likely we are to trigger either a response from Peter or legal action from one or more authorities. There is precedent. [https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/06/11/413676042/in-its-first-crowdfunding-case-ftc-goes-after-boardgame-kickstarter](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/06/11/413676042/in-its-first-crowdfunding-case-ftc-goes-after-boardgame-kickstarter) 

Getting your money back with a chargeback on your credit card

First of all, contact ITB via KS, their website ([https://www.insidethebox.games/contact](https://www.insidethebox.games/contact)), and FB. Ask for a refund and update. This should work whether you paid all or in part on KS, Backerkit, or the ITB website.

Second, find the dates and amounts on your credit card statement(s)- hope you saved your emails. I had charges from 2019, 2020, and 2021.

Third, call your credit card (the number’s on the back of your credit card), and ask for a chargeback/dispute a charge. A chargeback can normally only be done 120 days after purchase/delivery, but in the case of preorders it can be up to 120 days after the expected delivery date. (Some additional detail here: [https://myfigurecollection.net/blog/34867](https://myfigurecollection.net/blog/34867)) 

Your mileage may vary, but I had no trouble explaining that there were multiple delays after the original delivery date and I grew concerned after the August update stating ITB’s financial difficulties. Mention that you have gotten no response from the company despite contacting them multiple times.

Fourth, you may have to provide additional evidence; I did for two of three chargebacks. You will be told what to provide- receipts, a copy of ITB’s refund policy (this is near the bottom of each KS project, and probably key to a chargeback), etc. I also provided copies of my correspondences with ITB, ITB’s August update (if you were not a direct KS backer, it can be found here- it was a copy and paste for all of ITB’s active KS projects: [https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/160421/controversial-or-fraudulent-kickstarters?itemid=9397718&amp;commentid=11251175#comment11251175](https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/160421/controversial-or-fraudulent-kickstarters?itemid=9397718&amp;commentid=11251175#comment11251175)), and in the case of Aquanauts, Crypt X, and Subterra, screenshots or pictures of the game being sold at retail if possible (specifically for Sub Terra II: [https://www.gamenerdz.com/search.php?product\_line=All&amp;sort=Relevance&amp;limit=30&amp;name=sub+terra&amp;search\_query=sub+terra](https://www.gamenerdz.com/search.php?product_line=All&amp;sort=Relevance&amp;limit=30&amp;name=sub+terra&amp;search_query=sub+terra)). 

Chargebacks cost companies an additional $20-100 for the credit card company’s cost to process each one. Please use this only as a last resort.

Details will vary based on your individual circumstance, but you will want to provide such details as dates, amounts, and other requested information, including the resolution you are seeking (I asked for an accounting of the KS funds and to have “charges or penalties filed against him as appropriate and applicable.”) It is particularly helpful if you can cite the codes or laws violated in your jurisdiction; please share them with the authority you are contacting and me as well (I will try to collect all the info in the last link below).

I emphasized that I had tried to contact the company several times with no response, and grew concerned about not receiving what I had paid for after the August 24 2022 update regarding ITB’s financial difficulties (see this link for ITB’s contact info and financial documents: [https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/OC399970/filing-history](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/OC399970/filing-history)). I also said Peter had taken over a million pounds across 5 KS projects years ago and had either not even started manufacturing for some projects (Alba) or had started selling some of them in retail in 2022 before delivering to people who had paid for them (Sub Terra II, Aquanauts, Crypt X).

"Hi everyone!

I've always viewed the miniatures skirmish scene from afar, but recently its grabbed my attention for some reason - perhaps it is because I've been looking to pick up some minis for TTRPGs and it led me down the rabbit hole of games workshop models, etc. 

Anyway, I see that there are a ton of these sorts of games out there (Frostgrave, Warcry, Underworlds, Infinity, Battletech, and so on), but I don't really have any idea of what sets them apart from each other (besides theme) or what the current status of each title is; i.e. if it's currently in a healthy place, still seeing continuing support, just taking off, etc.  

If you play these sorts of games, which is your current favorite? Why? 

Are there any particular titles you would recommend to newcomers? If so, why?

Before this year I had a few party games like Mafia, Coup, and Spyfall but really wouldn't consider myself a collector.  At the beginning of the year, I got a few games either because they were classics, gifts, or for minis including Catan, Ticket to Ride, Powergrid, Mysterium, Zombicide, and Binding of Isaac. I had about 10 or so games at this time.  I didn't really start collecting board games until I moved into my current apartment in June and got in the habit of watch facebook marketplace for deals.  I recorded what I paid for every game if anyone is interested.  I'm now up to about 120 games.  Far too many unplayed, about 23 on my want to play collection.

I really like my collection, might start focusing on more higher quality games or expansions for my favorites rather than shotgunning any games I can find used.

"My partner and I have just started getting into board games and looking for recommendations. After playing hundreds of rounds of backgammon we were looking for something different. 

We picked up Machi Koro recently and have been really enjoying it with some modifications. With the base rules, we found that the convenience store strategy with a few good rolls early game is nearly impossible to beat. That makes the game someone boring so we implemented the random 8 card rule. We also implemented a rule for the red cards (the ones where you take coins from your opponent on their turn) that they activate AFTER your opponent earns coins for the round. We love this. It makes the red cards way more playable. 

Anyway, looking for recommendations. We really like Machi Koro with these rules, though I wish we didn't need to randomize the cards for it to be dynamic. My partner likes good artwork/theme. We haven't purchased the Machi Koro expansion yet and not sure if we should. Two to 4 players is ideal, though I am willing to consider two player only games. We like games that are simple to learn but are deep in strategy.

"My gf bought me Pandemic for my birthday last month - I’ve heard so many great things but I had a surprisingly really crappy first experience!  I’m not sure if there’s a rule mistake we’ve made because it felt like we’d been doing so well and then we’re nuked from orbit!

We were sitting on 2 outbreaks and 2 diseases cured. Only a handful of cubes on the board, and Karachi the only city with 2. I drew an epidemic card:

-	The infection card from the bottom of the deck was Mumbai, which had 1 cube already so an Outbreak in Mumbai. Added cubes to Karachi, Delhi and Chennai.
-	Added the Mumbai card to the discard pile, reshuffled the discard deck and added to the top of the infection deck.
-	Were now on 3 outbreaks so I draw 3 infection cards. The first is Karachi, which had already been on 2, had another added from the Mumbai outbreak and thus now also had an outbreak. Cubes added to Delhi (now on 3), Tehran, Mumbai, Riyadh and Baghdad.
-	This causes a chain reaction outbreak in Mumbai (outbreak 4, second in a turn but rules stated it’s only blocked from second outbreaks on the current infection card, and the previous came from the epidemic card). Cubes added to Delhi, Karachi, Chennai.
-	This causes a 5th outbreak in Delhi. Cubes added to Tehran, Kolkata, Chennai. No cubes added to Karachi or Mumbai as they’re already on 3 and already had outbreaks on this turn.
-	I turn over my final card of the 3 and it’s Delhi.  6th Outbreak in Delhi which causes chain reaction outbreaks 7 and 8 in Karachi and Mumbai. Game over.

The end result being that we suddenly jumped from a well-managed game state to game over with zero opportunity for any player decisions. As soon as I turned over that epidemic card, we were just turning over more cards and becoming increasingly dejected until we lost.

Did I make a mistake in the rules somewhere here? I’ve been really excited about getting into Pandemic and was actually thinking about getting Season 1 until my gf bought be the base game - now I’m wondering if the mechanics just don’t sit right with me! 

(It did not help that this was our second game and in our first we drew an epidemic card on round 1 next to a 3 cube city and started the game with 3 outbreaks and Europe overrun!)

"Hey folks,

Last year, I replaced my 10 year old copy of 7 wonders with the 2nd edition - the og box and cards were basically disintegrated. When I did so, I also bought a copy of Leaders and Cities. Since then, I've had a hard time with managing the pieces. 

I bought the Broken Token fleet organizer, which was well built and solved military, coin, and card storage. However, it was intended for the first edition, and I missed that upon purchase. 

Due to this, the boards don't fit properly, and the portion intended for the Armada expansion (which I currently do not own) might only fit the 1st edition part? Unsure. 

Q1. Does anyone know if there's a size or content difference between the 1st and 2nd edition of Armada? I'm tempted to just use the organizer I have, and if not, I might buy the 1st edition if there's size differences. 

Q2. Does anyone know of a box organizer for 2nd edition? 

Q3. How do you organize your box? Pictures are welcome. 

Q4. Have any tips for me with this awkward box situation?

"I am a firm believer that any complexity a game mechanic brings to the table needs to be outweighed by the additional fun that mechanic also brings. In other words, if a game is hard to learn, it better be an absolute blast to make up for all the time you spent learning how to play.

"Hey guys and gals, 

I am a board game enthusiast and have been for many years. Since childhood I designed my own games for fun mostly card and board games, but three years ago I came up with an idea that honestly has just been getting better and better over the years and has reached an incredible amount of potential. It is a tabletop game system that applies to an obscene amount of genres and could seriously move from board games into video games and other formats. The more I think about this the more applications I find. So far I have developed 2 board games using this system and they run incredibly well and recently I have been thinking about the future of the system. I want to either put it out into the world and see what happens or take it to a development company and pitch the idea. My biggest dilemma is I want to trademark the system if that's even possible or need insight as to if that is a good idea or even necessary. I'm at a point were I feel I need to push this idea. I just have no idea we're to start.

"I enjoy playing heavy/crunchy games.  But I have a problem when I play with some people/some combination of people that I could use help articulating and troubleshooting.

The problem is occurs when off-topic conversations are going on when I am taking my turn and trying to make a decision /  wrestling with analysis paralysis.  I find that, especially if those conversations are loud, I can't tune them out.  I may be pulled into them, but usually I won't but they will still add considerably to my cognitive load which is frustrating for me and slows me down, which is frustrating for both me and everyone else.

My instinct is that this is mostly something about my brain, and thus if I want some sort of accommodation from people who otherwise enjoy playing with me, I need to be able to articulate something as actionable as but much more reasonable than ""don't talk at all during my turn"".

Had the idea that a classic murder mystery style dinner party thing might help both sides - since everyone is given characters the dnd guys will be happy with the chance to role play, and it'll be more fun for the others too.

Only thing is I need one where the plot is good, not too easy, not too ""formulaic"". Ideally I'd like one where it's not necessary to have a host/DM that knows all the plot so I can play too, but having it be a good game is more important.

"Below are the games I currently have (Bold) and have owned/had. I’m looking to try a new game and hope someone can introduce me to one with the following criteria 

1. I want to find a new game that’s great solo but also is good at two players. That’s usually the player count I have the most so something that works great at those numbers but option for more is a huge bonus too

2. It has to be thematic, using the game list below hopefully someone can find something that can slide into similar themes or mechanics. 

3. Finally it has to be fun but also involve some critical thinking. Especially at the solo player level. 


The first four are games I currently own. 

Dune Imperium and Heat are great examples of good solo play but play excellent with a higher player count too. Thematic they are great medium light to medium heavy games and I’ll add Wingspan as another with good solo play too but that one is a bit more of a chore.

Unmatched is excellent for head to head but lacks any solo capabilities while Endurance is a very light game that’s fun with 2-5 players.

"hey all, my friends and I are planning on having a murder mystery party dinner during our trip to the cabin... There's 11 of us total. None of us have ever played a murder mystery party before, let alone host it. We will be playing the Champagne Murder (link: [https://www.universitygames.com/games/mystery/champagne](https://www.universitygames.com/games/mystery/champagne)

In the instructions it says that the host (me) shouldn't read the player booklets or watch the accompanying videos prior to playing the game - but since it's my first time hosting/playing, would it be a good idea to read everything out first? I'm asking because I thought it would be beneficial to assign characters to people that I know will do a good job at ""driving"" the game. for example, I wouldn't want one of my quiet or reserved friends to be assigned a ""main character"" (if there are any, I wouldn't know)",Advice for hosting your first Murder Mystery Party night?,1,self.boardgames,102rym1,Jacqves,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/102rym1/advice_for_hosting_your_first_murder_mystery/,1672801038
"Just purchased my first home and my partner and I found ourselves constantly watching tv to pass the time.

In 2023 I want to start a fun hobby that we can do instead of mindlessly watching tv, and boardgames feels like exactly what we need.

After a bunch of research I went out and grabbed some games that felt like a good entry point. Code names Duet, azul, splendor, patchwork, and Onitama.

Have been loving these so went out and bought a few more complex ones. Lost Cities, mysterium, dominion, terraforming mars expedition…and then I came across an open box of Goomhaven.

Completely unused, pieces not even popped out! $50.

I know it’s not a beginner friendly game but I’ve read about it and it sounds like something we’d love and can sink many hours into.

"This is probably going to be a hard question. I’m trying to remember this simple card game I played back in grade school (during the 2000's), it was all the rage and everyone played it, but no one from my childhood that I ask remembers it at all. I’ve tried searching for it all over the internet without success and so am turning to Reddit to see if anyone knows it. Here’s what I remember about the game:

I recall it being Lord of the Rings themed, but I suspect this was just a licensed version. I’m not sure about that, but when I try searching lists of LOTR games I can’t find it. 

The game was extremely simple, at least the version I played, which may not have been using the full rules. To start, you split the deck equally in half between 2 players. Each card shows a different LOTR character and bears different values for the same 5 attributes. I don’t remember the names of the attributes, but they were something like Strength, Defense, Agility, Magic, and Resistance to the Ring (Strength and Resistance are the only 2 names I’m mostly sure about).

So for example, there might be a Frodo card that would have 1 Strength, 3 Defense, 2 Agility, 2 Magic, and 9 (the max) Resistance to the ring. 

The gameplay was piss simple. Players would simply take turns drawing the top card of their deck, choosing an attribute for comparison, and then the player with the lowest number of that attribute would lose and have to discard their card and draw a new one. 

For example, player 1 might have Frodo, and choose Resistance, saying out loud “Resistance nine.” Player 2 would then answer “Resistance one” and reveal their card (say Boromir), lose, and discard it. They would then draw another card and choose another attribute. For example they might draw Aragorn and so choose Strength, knowing that it would definitely defeat Frodo in that category.

"Inspired and encouraged by the 'other' great post about the [DIY IKEA Bjursta Gaming Table](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/d39rc5/easy_diy_ikea_bjursta_gaming_table/), I finally decided to take the plunge and create my own version!

Since I took a slightly different path (with different result) I thought you might be interested in how I did this. And I just wanted to give back a little bit this way, because the initial post helped me so much with this project.

Full album: [https://imgur.com/gallery/uweCufu](https://imgur.com/gallery/uweCufu)

First, let's see the start and finish:

[The table fully slid out and the extra pieced in the middle removed.](https://preview.redd.it/l6yleq3d8w9a1.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=877706c88fcda18520d02db16231d0e37bd17123)

[The final version with board and cloth. Play close attention to the corners; they're round!](https://preview.redd.it/575v3t3d8w9a1.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5e068ef645453ae3e61436cc3508eda33b2701d)

As the other post stated, the Bjursta is wonderful for this project, because it already as a lowered frame to holde the extra middle pieces in case you want to increase the table size. Unfortunately, IKEA doesn't produce these table anymore. Fortunately, I easily found a bunch of them on the second hand market (in Holland).

I'm not going to repeat all 39 images here, but I can summarize the steps to create the table.

* Obviously find yourself a Bjursta. Remove the extra lids and unscrew the fixed lids and remove the metal sliders from the guide rail as well as the two screws in the middle of the long sides.
* Buy yourself a nice board. It should not be too thick, because the table itself isn't very deep already. I want for a 4mm board. It seems a little Wobbly, but once you put it down it's a lot better. Also, in my version the board is support in the corners by the table itself (no extra wood pieces needed in this version).
* Remove one of the metal corner plates and use them to draw the corners on the board. Then saw away the corners. After initially sawing the entire board table and then cutting away the corners, if your board is still too wide or long, use a hand plan to reduce the side a bit. Unless you were way off of course, then get at it again with the (jig)saw.

* Now replace the bolts of the metal corner plates with shorter ones. You can even get them with the nut already attached. The original bolts are very long and will be in the way of the board.
* &amp;#x200B;

* Get your self a board cloth, like a poker cloth, neoprene or in my case a curtain material that can be used on furniture: Toppoint Isola. The great thing about the Isola is that it's thick enough that you don't need foam in between. It's not cheap however; normally it goes for about 50 euro a meter I think (I got it for free, yay).
* Spray universal spray glue on the board (don't create wet pools, that will ruin the surface of the fabric as it soaks through and creates hard lumps) and drape the cloth on top.
* Cut around the sides. Don't worry about folding it around to the back in my version. I use edging trim/strips later on to hide the edges and fix the board in place.
* Optionally create the fabric with a super hydrophobic spray for easy cleaning.
* Basically the table is usable now, but you can go further still
* Buy two long flexible edging trims/strips, push them against the sides and push the corners into a bend. Then make sure you cut the in the middle of the short sides and after that, while holding the bend in shape with some pressure, fasten the strips against the side with either very fast contact glue (not recommended due to the bend's pressure push back), double sided (carpet) tape (carpet tape being thinner than normal double sided tape) or in my case: black screws.

* Repeat for the other side, connecting the strips in the middle of the short sides and you're done! If you use screws, make sure you screw into the lower half of the strips, as the middle covers the guide rails for the metal sliders, so there's nothing to screw into there.

[Neat corners!](https://preview.redd.it/r166f96obw9a1.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d252570bf81784a90d3fb325ac23fcd590c4369)

* Enjoy!

"Title basically says it all.  My friends and I love logic puzzles and deduction games, but playing as the Recruiter in this game just feels completely impossible.  If you're up against people who can properly communicate and understand the game, I feel as though there's very little you can actually do to slow them down.

Should we implement a stricter timer for Agent turns so they can't coordinate as effectively?  Are there any more advanced strategies the Recruiter can use to better avoid the Agents?  Every time I've played, the Agents have had no trouble deducing which way thr Recruiter is going just by randomly guessing Features until they get a couple hits, turn them into Mental Notes, and from there it's very easy to pinpoint the direction the Recruiter is going in.  And you just have *so much time* to do it.  You get 4 agent turns for every step the Recruiter takes, so by hour 8 you'll pretty much win by brute-forcing the possible tiles he could even be on.

Maybe we're playing it wrong, it's a shame because it's such a cool game on paper, I just wish it was somehow a little more dynamic if you played as the Recruiter.

"Chronological!

**Machi Koro 2** - A bit streamlined, but I liked it better than the first game.  This is probably what I'd toss at somebody who wanted to play Monopoly - you still roll dice, buy property, get money, but it's over quickly.  Simple for my tastes but cute.  If given the choice will still probably take Space Base. 6.5 - solid family game.

**Roll For It!** (Deluxe Edition) - Surprisingly fun filler, but I attribute some of that to the guy who brought the game enthusiastically egging people on to go for the big risks and high payoffs.  Simple game: a few cards in the center of the table, showing certain numbers and values of dice.  On your turn, roll your handful of dice, assign them as you like.  First person to complete a card takes it.  7 with someone talking it up like a street game, probably 6.5 without - good for filling time between big games.

**Deception: Murder in Hong Kong** - I didn't appreciate this one as much as I'd hoped from all the love it gets here.  We got really stuck unable to decipher the clues and it was just kind of frustrating.  Normally, there's a murderer, a piece of key evidence, and a means that need to be identified.  One person knows the solution but can only communicate by marking vague clues on tiles.  Investigators have to identify all three things correctly, while murderer tries to sow doubt and confusion.  We didn't need any extra doubt or confusion, the scientist kept giving similar clues that pointed to the same things that weren't the answer, and we just kept going in circles until the game ended.  5 - Would give one more try but probably not for me.

**Stupid Deaths** - A friend brought this one and everyone opted for it over my objections.  A bit like the end sequence of the Jackbox Trivia Murder Party (answer questions correctly, or get caught by death and eliminated), only with the questions entirely describing some ridiculous death and you have to vote real or made up.  Basically a test of who spends the most time reading random @#$% online. 2 - Alas I was unable to surreptitiously set this on fire before the owner left with it, and there remains a danger they will bring it again one day.

**Forgotten Waters** - I picked this up cheap used, and played with a pretty big group of fairly casual gamers, where it seemed to go over pretty well - at least, I was invited back to finish the first story.  It's just a shame I didn't love it myself.  It's sort of a choose-your-own-adventure game, you're all pirates sailing around looking for the MacGuffin, each location is a page in the book, you pick your task and do your skill check and see what happens, and then you input the results into the app and it reads you some story.  The story is silly, the voice acting sillier - all in a good way - and people seemed to have a good time with it.  My issues were mostly that it was too simple a game, coming down to ""place your character, roll a D12"" most of the time.  The things I'd hoped for - infighting between the crew resulting from tensions between what was good for the quest vs. what was good for the individual pirates - didn't materialize enough, a little bit of light loot stealing here and there being about it.  It also threatened to drag a little bit as you sailed around sometimes, I ended up burning some resources to push our speed so nobody got bored, which I thought was a little flawed - resources should be used to combat challenges, not just make the game go quicker.  I did appreciate that the app is a web app (so it won't ever be obsoleted by OS updates or fall off an app store, and the company has committed to open-sourcing it if they ever end support for the game), but I'll ultimately be rehoming it.  6 - great for what it is, would probably be a smash with families, but not much here for heavy gamers.

**Return to Dark Tower** - I'll admit as a gimmick game, it's an impressive gimmick.  Giant app-controlled tower sits in the center of the board, spitting out skulls randomly, flashing lights and making noises.  It'll catch your attention.  Sadly, the gameplay doesn't really measure up.  Move around, removing skulls from the map so you don't lose (Pandemic-like), trying to power up your characters to face the boss.  The big problem for me was the app - half the game exists in this black box of bad things, and I just don't like games that work that way.  Playing on the easiest mode, the main game was pretty easy, and then lost at the final boss pretty decisively - and we couldn't even tell exactly how far short we fell because of the stupid app.  5 - impressive presentation but a complete waste of $150.

**Root: The Marauder Expansion** - It's so, so good.  This is the expansion that bumped Root that last point from a 9 to a 10 for me.  The Warlord is fun chaos, the Badgers are a great thinky puzzle, advanced setup is *required* for the game (fortunately it's very PnP-able), and the hirelings finally make the 3p game as good as the 4-5p.  If there's a bit of a miss *anywhere* in this box, it's that they don't completely fix 2-player.  They make it better, but I'm still not jumping to play this at 2.  It shakes up the meta nicely, makes it more aggressive and entangled, delivers some welcome mild buffs to cats, lizards, and crows, and upsets the Vagabond's world a little because he's no longer the only one out for items.  I think I would *probably* still recommend Underworld as the first expansion to buy (and PnP advanced setup cards), but Marauder still adds so much extra content and variability.  10 - I just love it so much.

**6 Nimmt! / Take 5** - Took a few games on our first family holiday since covid hit, but this was the only one we ended up playing.  It's a great filler/light game that accommodates a wide range of player counts and you can teach kids and grandma equally easily.  All simultaneously choose a card from their hand, reveal, play from lowest to highest at the ends of rows on the table.  Go past the end? Take the row as penalty points.  Lots of push-your-luck and educated guessing about what others will play, and then you find you guessed wrong and exploded a row and well *shit*.  I will say that I'd probably rather play it at 5 than 4, at 4 often there are enough guaranteed safe plays that nothing happens, adding one more player doubles the chaos.  7.5 - always bring this to family stuff.

**Moonrakers** - Negotiation games are very hit-or-miss for me.  I adore Bohnanza. John Company is super interesting, although I haven't managed to get it played yet.  I did not enjoy this one at all.  This is a deckbuilder where you choose a challenge and have to play cards to overcome it - succeed, get a reward.  But you can invite other players to help you do harder challenges, however you have to negotiate the divvying up of the loot to make it worth their while.  I couldn't really figure out the value of things, I wasn't sure what to really do, I just felt lost and eventually gave up.  Went through the motions until the game was mercifully over.  3 - just really not for me, I'll pass on this forever.

**Cascadia** - I normally like really high-interaction games.  Cascadia has no interaction outside of a little hate-drafting.  So then it was a surprise that I actually quite enjoyed it.  Each turn, pick a tile and animal pair.  Add the tile to your little ecosystem, put the animal somewhere in it.  Score points at the end based on both tile placement and animal patterns.  Pretty simple, but it's just a pleasant pastime.  Nice art, nice tactile feel.  Just, nice.  7.5 - Keep a copy around as a gateway game.

**Quacks of Quedlinburg** - As above, normally like the high-interaction games.  But no, another surprise, Quacks is great.  Didn't expect it, but very quickly got invested in the push-your-luck aspect.  Everyone simultaneously draws from a bag, placing things on a track (the higher the number, the further from the last placed item it goes), each different type has a different effect, but one type will make you explode.  Fortunately, exploding doesn't hurt too badly, so the sting is part of the fun instead of feeling bad.  Simple, fun, quick, plenty of variability, I very quickly forgot I was playing multiplayer solitaire.  7.8 - I'm strongly considering grabbing myself a copy, I just *wish* it played more players without expansions or extra copies because it'd be the ultimate 6-8 player game.

**Agents of SMERSH** (Epic Edition) - This was just not my year for co-ops.  This is a Similar To But Legally Distinct From James Bond game, where you travel the world, doing random encounters to buff your skills up before fighting through henchmen to get to the Big Boss.  It's a little Tales of the Arabian Nights with its big book of stories, but they failed to delight me, and all that was left was a pretty basic move, test a skill, get a reward or a punishment structure.  We beat the first henchman and stopped playing.  This updated KS version is a very nice production, but feels like a big waste of money (fortunately, I wasn't the one who backed it).  5 - yawn.

**Cthulhu Wars** - I'm very glad I finally got to play this.  It's a game I will likely never own, thanks to its price, size, Petersen's inability to run a company, and my policy of not giving money to awful people.  But it's so satisfying to whack down a monster the size of a coke can and roll a bucket of dice.  An experience like few other games for sure.  Felt a little like a streamlined Chaos in the Old World, in mostly good ways but I missed the aggressively mean card effects.  Perhaps one day I'll at least track down the Duel version of everything for a cheap version that fits on my shelf and table.  8 - and that's with one play, could go higher once I actually learn it.

**Gravwell** (2nd edition) - I had no expectations, I'd seen it before and it didn't look that interesting.  But this was a surprisingly fun quick chaotic game.  You're racing along a track using cards that either pull you towards the closest object, propel you away from it, or pull/push the other objects instead.  You choose simultaneously but resolve in card priority order, meaning the clever big move you tried to pull off could instead fire you backwards.  It's fast, it's silly, and it's over in 30 minutes.  8 - a great fast simple experience.

**Dimension** - Last game of 2022, some friends had received it for Christmas.  It's a spatial puzzle game - you have a base, sets of 3 balls in 5 different colours, and have to build a little pyramid of them according to 6 randomly drawn goal cards - goals such as ""number of blue and orange balls must total 4"", ""all green balls must touch at least one other green ball"", ""no blue balls may touch"", ""no white balls may be on top of any other balls"", and so on.  Of course, there's a sand timer to make sure there's some pressure.  Do this a few times, add up points from completed goals. Of course there's no interaction, and sometimes we found the drawn set of goals to be super easy and everyone got all of them; overall wasn't much here for us.  4 - at least it's quick.",2022 - 15 New-To-Me Games,1,self.boardgames,102h4q5,limeybastard,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/102h4q5/2022_15_newtome_games/,1672774512

"I feel many of the new components have very limited explanations in the rulebook. It's more or less mandatory to read ALL components to understand their functions, and even then it feels strange. Like, the tunnel map: is it ONLY meant for the single time Long John Silver might play the trick to travel in the tunnel? If so, how come the rulebook doesn't explicitly tell you the map belongs to Long John silver (no indication of that) and why isn't it more obvious regarding its ownership and limited use, for such a prominent component?


Also, rules on movement through or via the new limited areas is not clear. It feels like the lack of examples and limited explanation really leaves you with intepreting a LOT, and that feels like bad rules to me.


Finally, a more general question: is it only me, or are the black spot hints actually worse for long John silver? Many of them feel like they give away A LOT and it's difficult to understand why they are the way they are? I'm not sure I get their balance or application

"If you have ever stumbled upon the conspiracy theory of Vostok Station in the Antarctic I am sure you were, at the very least, a little intrigued. My imagination exploded like the night sky on the Fourth of July. I bought a sketchbook and started spewing ideas all over it. To my surprise it turned out to be the most sick, twisted and glorious story I have ever heard. I started to flesh it out and I want to share it here. 

The Vostok Station conspiracy is that the initial research team ran into a new organism. This 14 legged Octopus killed some of the researchers. It was incredibly smart, strategic and possessed supernatural abilities.

Now if you perform any research on the Antarctic, three conspiracies quickly rise to the top; Illuminati, Aliens and Nazis… yes Nazis. 

So combine all these things and you have the most delicious sci-fi horror soup you have ever put to your lips. 

The board game begins like this:

After a distress signal was sent from the station an unprecedented storm isolated Vostok. After days the storm still raged. Private recon teams are sent in to try and reach the station but only one barely makes it. What they are greeted with is the aftermath of a massacre

I had this hilarious idea to create a board game about toilets in Japan for a while now, so I decided to use [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/) which has been gaining a lot of traction online for being an extremely accurate AI word generation tool. Keyed in some prompts and BAM - it spit out a nicely written rulebook for this game idea I had. I'm writing this post to share what I got.

Here's what I got:

# Toilet Tycoons of Tokyo

**Introduction**

Welcome to the vibrant and chaotic world of Toilets Over Tokyo! In this unique board game, you will take on the role of a plucky and ambitious entrepreneur in Japan, competing against other players to build the most successful and respected toilet empire in the bustling city of Tokyo.

As you collect resources, construct new toilet facilities, and expand your territory, you will need to navigate the complex and unpredictable landscape of Japanese business and culture. You'll need to be clever, resourceful, and ready to adapt to whatever challenges come your way.

Whether you're a fan of Japanese culture or just enjoy a good strategic challenge, we believe you'll find Toilets Over Tokyo to be a captivating and rewarding game. So let's get started and see who will emerge as the ultimate toilet tycoon of Tokyo!

**Game Components:**

Game board: The game board represents the city of Tokyo and is divided into different areas where you can build your toilet facilities.

Resource tokens: There are five types of resource tokens in the game: water, wood, steel, cement, and money. You will need these resources to construct new toilet facilities and upgrade existing ones.

Toilet tiles: There are four types of toilet tiles in the game, each with their own unique abilities and effects. You will need to carefully choose which toilet tiles to use and where to place them on the board to maximize your advantage.

Player pieces: Each player will have their own set of pieces, including a player board, scoring marker, and any special tokens or cards that they may acquire during the game.

Dice: The game includes two standard six-sided dice, which are used to determine the outcome of certain actions and events.

**Setup:**

1. Place the game board in the center of the play area.

2. Shuffle the toilet tiles and place them face down in a stack near the game board.

3. Each player chooses a color and takes the corresponding player pieces. Place your scoring marker on the ""0"" space of the score track on the game board.

4. Each player takes a starting supply of resources as follows: 3 water, 2 wood, 1 steel, 1 cement, and 50 money.

5. Roll the dice to determine the starting player. Play then proceeds clockwise from that player.

**Gameplay:**

The game is played over a series of rounds, with each player taking a turn in order. On your turn, you will have the opportunity to perform one of the following actions:

Collect resources: Roll the dice and collect the corresponding resources from the supply.

Construct a toilet facility: Spend the required resources to place a toilet tile on the board.

Upgrade a toilet facility: Spend the required resources to improve an existing toilet tile.

Pass: Choose to pass and take no further actions this turn.

At the end of each round, players will score points based on the toilet facilities they have built and the resources they have collected. The game ends when a player reaches a predetermined number of points, and the player with the most points wins.

**Event Cards:**

During the course of the game, you may choose to draw an event card instead of taking one of the other available actions. Event cards can bring both positive and negative consequences, and can affect gameplay in a variety of ways. Some examples of event cards include:

Kaiju attack: A giant monster appears and wreaks havoc on Tokyo! All players must discard one of their toilet tiles at random.

Natural disaster: A typhoon or earthquake hits the city, causing widespread damage. All players must discard one resource of their choice.

Windfall: Good luck comes your way in the form of an unexpected financial gain. Draw two extra resource tokens from the supply.

Event cards are resolved immediately when they are drawn and then discarded.

That's the basic overview of the game! Of course, there are many more details and nuances to the gameplay, which we will cover in the rest of this rulebook. Happy gaming!

Prompts I used:

\&gt; Rewrite the introduction for this board game, that is titled 'Toilets Over Tokyo' and is Japanese themed.

\&gt; Rewrite the rulebook and add in Event Cards such as Kaiju Attacks.

\&gt; Give me a cooler-sounding name for this board game.

"I absolutely love this hobby, but apparently I suck at playing games and winning. According to my stats, I played a ton of games and only won 30% of them. This combined with me recently being stomped to death in Lost Cities by my wife led me to the conclusion that I suck at actually winning games. But that's not a bad thing, because that's not why I play.

I looked at those stats and realized that in each and every single game that I lost last year, I had a blast. I truly loved sitting down, playing a game with friends (or strangers at a con), and just being a part of a great community. There wasn't a single game on that last that I looked at and said ""Oh man, that really sucks because I should win these games."" 

So as we are starting the new year and people may (or may not) be reflecting on their wins or losses, remember that these are for fun and as long as you're enjoying yourself, the scores never matter because you've already won.",I looked at my BG Stats for 2022 and realized I suck at board gaming...,1,self.boardgames,1028xzs,spqr2001,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1028xzs/i_looked_at_my_bg_stats_for_2022_and_realized_i/,1672754377

"I recently developed a game and am having the prototype shipped to my house, but the cost of a (CAH-sized) box full of cards was $130! The cheapest I could get on GameCrafter was ~$65 with a massive bulk order. I don't blame them of course since they're printing custom parts for a prototype, but I couldn't possibly sell my game for a price like that.

Is there some special means of printing games I'm unaware of or are there really that many publishers able to drive the prices of their games  down? Because I have no clue how so many people are able to find publishers.

Either way, this struggle has really made me reconsider what ""expensive"" means in regards to board games.

"Okay so I played a game at a gathering recently, basically it's a game you play while you play games all night (or while you do whatever else people do all night with other people).


Each player/attendee is given a plastic wallet with 6 slots, and 6 fortune cookie fortune sized cards.

Each card says something on them like, ""make someone take a sip of your drink"", ""get someone to answer your phone"", ""pretend there is a noise and get someone to agree they hear it too"", ""get someone to lie on the floor with you"".

If you get caught out, you fold over your card and show the 'failed' side, if you complete it successfully you fold over your card and show the 'completed' side.

"Thought I would share my end of year wrap up since this is the first full year I have tracked plays and I've enjoyed reading everyone else's. 


My Total Plays: 190 Plays


Unique Games: 97 Games


New to me Games: 20 Games, 6 of which came out in 2022


Favorite new to me game: Dune Imperium- I love this game so much, one of 3 games rated a 10.  I love how DI puts you in direct conflict for so many sources of points so it feels interactive throughout and often players feel like they outplayed another player. The deck building feels impactful since cards have multiple uses and pretty much every card will be used in some shape of form. Beyond that it is just so smooth and easy to get to the table. I played both with and without The Rise of Ix, love it both ways, excited to get Immortality.


Favorite 2022 release: My Father's Work- I didn't think I would like this game, seemed like an average worker placement game mixed with a lot of narrative, neither elements of games that I particularly enjoy. But this one comes together well, first the narrative is fun and keeps things light. Second the fact that you have a soft reset between rounds and most rounds give you unique microgoals make each age feel meaningful. Lastly the turns are snappy go the game never feels like it drags even though it is a long game. Not a game that I will ever play every week but one I will look forward to playing about twice a year and having a blast with it. Definitely the new Halloween game in my house.


Shelf of Shame: 7 Games in order of most shameful(aka oldest to newest) and why they are haven't been played

Founders of Gloomhaven- 2020 Got it to support my FLGS during peak pandemic mostly due to my love of Gloomhaven. I've played half a learning game before we had to put it down and thought the ideas were interesting but the game is a bit convoluted. Debating whether it will actually get played or if I should just let it go.

Gloomhaven Jaws of the Lion- Mar 2022 Got this to see if my friend would want to join me and my wife when Frosthaven arrived.  Took a while to get it painted and then the holidays delayed diving in. Plan is to dive in after we get through our new games from Christmas.

Chronicles of Crime- Aug 2022 My friends have this to us after they had played through the cases they wanted to. Just have not had the 2 player time with my wife to try it yet, the joys of having 2 kids and my wife starting an in home business.

Frosthaven- Dec 2022 Got an early Christmas present from Cepholafair,I expect with the exclusion of Founders this will go unplayed the longest since we will go through JotL so I know who I'll be playing with and I'll want to paint it before we start.

Ahoy- It's all 2022 Christmas presents from here. I asked for this one as a more accessible and probably slightly less loved alternative to Root.

Cry Havoc- That cover has transfixed me since it came out, Sci Fi is definitely my favorite theme. Apparently I was in an asymmetric mood putting together my wish list this year and my group have been on a bit of a DoaM kick recently so excited to try this one out.

Sidereal Confluence-  Like I said, it was a very assymetric Christmas (I also got Imperium Classics and a Deckscape game but played both of those). Hoping this can capture some of the Bohnanza trading magic with a cooler theme and the asymmetry I'm digging right now.


11 most played games, cause 5 are tied for 6th

Dune Imperium: 10 Plays- It's both easy to setup and play and great do of course we played it a bunch.

King of Tokyo: 7 Plays- Played with the adult game group a couple of times but mostly took advantage of the fact the kids enjoy rolling dice to play it as a family.

Jump Drive: 6 Plays- My favorite filler game, love how quick you get a meaningful engine going.

Sleeping God's: 6 Plays- Didn't live this one but my buddy was into it. I counted as a play each time we got it out, essentially went through an entire run.

The Crew The Quest for Planet Nine: 6 Plays- All in one sitting, those hands just go so quick.

Root: 5 Plays I love it but it's definitely an event game so it doesn't hit the table as much as some others. Really enjoyed The Marauder Expansion though.

Dale of Merchants: 4 Plays- We like deck builders, this one does a good job feeling different since cards go in and out of your deck pretty quickly.

Dominion: 4 Plays- It's a classic for a reason, hoping to get this one played much more this year.

Marvel Legendary: 4 Plays- Another great deck builder, my buddy collects everything got it so we use each release as an excuse to bust it out again.

Marvel United: 4 Plays- Accessible and easy to bust out. My buddy got his all in which we started playing so I gave mine to a nephew. Love these minis though, probably the most enjoyable minis to paint I have found so far.

Wonderlands War: 4 Plays- Got the deluxe edition for my birthday, with the exception of 1 play that was infuriating, had a good time with it. Those minis look like they might give the Marvel United minis a run for their money on the fun to paint scale.",My 2022 Wrap Up,1,self.boardgames,101rq8e,gijoe61703,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/101rq8e/my_2022_wrap_up/,1672703108

"Great little game, but it has 2 very weird almost amateurish flaws in an overall very elegant game :

* The game has a first player token that serves absolutely NO PURPOSE AT ALL. This one is inconsequential, but it bothers me to no extent. The rule says you're supposed to give it to the next player when your drawing new tiles, but the game is made in a way where you don't have the same number of tiles depending on the number of player, precisely so the last player is always the one playing when your drawing new tiles.

In the edition I have they even went out of their way and gave 2 different first player tokens, one being a cheap cardboard coin, and the other is a fancy wooden Greek pillar. It's complete lunacy !

* The other problem, this one is a real issue, they are giving a penalty to the first players. The first player get only 1 gold (it's not gold but whatever), 2 to the second, 3 to the third...

This gold is used to buy tiles that are arranged in a line, the further the tile is in the line, the more expensive it is (first tile is free, the second is 1 gold, the third is 2 gold...).

But it makes absolutely no sense, the only advantage you may have as a first player is to choose your tile first, but since your choice is limited by your amount of gold, that means the first player can only choose between the 2 first tiles.

You have as much chance to have a desirable tile in the first or second place than anywhere else, so it would have been more fair to give 1 gold to everyone, so for the first turn everybody can only choose between 2 tiles, one of them being unobtainable by the previous player.

Again, it's supee easy to fix, by it annoys me so much to have a game so slick making such dumb mistakes. Especially when it's a very simple game and these rules are just adding confusion.",two weird and minor gripes about Akropolis,1,self.boardgames,101r2g1,SylvineKiwi,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/101r2g1/two_weird_and_minor_gripes_about_akropolis/,1672701488

"My friend and I played the first two missions today, he as the Germans and I the Soviets.

My initial impression is very favorable.  There is a lot to think about and the game, while fast-playing and relatively simple at first glance, offers layers of tactical and strategic decision-making that in my opinion are very well abstracted by the deck-building mechanics.  Every decision is a trade-off; you can almost never do all the things you want, but you can always do something to improve the situation for the next turn.

Based on just these two games it seems that the game definitely rewards judicious risk taking and, simultaneously, punishes over-cautious play.  You have to decide pretty much with each decision whether to advance, knowing you're exposing your troops to risk, or build up your abilities (deck), knowing that your hesitation might give your opponent the window he's been looking for.  

Several reviews have talked about the breath-holding anticipation of watching your opponent take his turns and that definitely rang true for me.

I wish the graphics on the map tiles were a little less drab.  I realize that probably aerial views of mid-war Stalingrad looked much like this but a little more contrast would have brought the city to life more.  Instead it's all sort of a smudge of grey-brown and distinguishing between roads, dirt and train tracks is not easy.  It doesn't really affect gameplay at all, just wish it looked a little less monotonous.  

As we're pretty early into the game I haven't seen a lot of the advanced systems, but already we've suffered casualties and earned upgrades which has had an immediate effect on gameplay.   As an aside the artist deserves some special award for the illustration for the reserve soldier I had to use to replace a rifleman; he is carrying just a broken shovel, instead of a rifle, and his penalty for being a reserve?  He can only shoot at range 0.  Yes, he's just attacking people right next to him with this shovel.  

Also I should note that I have not played any Undaunted games previously, this is a new system for me, and I know I made at least some mistakes. Specifically I didn't add Fog of War cards when I should have while scouting.  It would be great if the Scout card had some sort of indicator on the action to remind you that was required when placing scouting tokens.  Lastly I should highlight for people who have played Undaunted in its other incarnations that there are a few rules changes that are highlighted - definitely look for these in the rulebook as they will have an impact (so says my friend, who had just played Normandy for the first time a few days ago).",Undaunted: Stalingrad early impressions,1,self.boardgames,101pmfa,jmwfour,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/101pmfa/undaunted_stalingrad_early_impressions/,1672698048

"Hey Brass-Pro's,

I'm a new to this game, having played a few 2 player games to work out the rules. I have a few questions that I cannot find answers to on Reddit, the rules, or how-to-play videos.

1. On turn 1 I built a Coal Mine in Redditch for $5 for my first action. My wife followed up by building an Iron Station in Redditch which costs $5 and 1 coal. Can she use the coal from my coal mine in Redditch even though we have no links elsewhere, because they are in the same town? In this scenario it was turn 1 and no one was connected to the market, which is where I get confused.
2. Can I use the Iron market on turn 1 to build something requiring Iron even though there are no connections to the coal market cities? It is my understanding Iron ""flies"" and does not need a connection via canal/train to be used, so it makes sense to me that you could do this. This means I could start turn 1 by building Beer for $5 + the cost of the iron from the market at the start of the game, correct?
3. Not a turn 1 question, but at the end of the Canal Era when removing all level I industry tiles, if they have resources on them are they still flipped and the excess resources return to the general supply? It seems like I would based on the rules I've read/watched.

I absolutely adore this one. It is the game that got me into the true Euro-style games, those that have a bland theme and amazing mechanisms, and I love them all to bits. Definitely one of favorite categories of games.

2: **Orleans**

Another amazing Eurogame. It’s such a solid experience and I loved the bagbuilding mechanic. This isn’t the game that introduced me to deck/bag building, that recognition would go to Dominion, Star Realms, and Fort, but this game is a brilliant game that I love to pieces and I really want to play again.

3: **Dominion**

This is my favorite deck builder. I adore all three that I mentioned when describing Orleans but this is my favorite of them. Another game I really want to play again.

Rating: 10/10

4: **Space Base**

Gotta love a good engine builder. This one just clicks with me in a way that some others don’t. The theme and the way everything gets activated is so well-implemented that I could play this one again and again.

Rating: 10/10

5: **Heaven &amp; Ale**

I was initially skeptical of this game. We played as part of our challenge that dictates that we play the entirety of my relative’s collection (I love board games but I don’t own nearly as many as them). I truly didn’t know what to expect but I ended up loving this game in a way I truly didn’t see coming. It’s brilliant.

Rating: 9/10

6: **Imhotep**

I like many games done by many different designers, but when I think of my favorite designer it would have to be Phil Walker-Harding. All of the games that I have played from him have easily landed in high spots on my top games list. This is no different. It has such a fun mechanic that both provides high player interaction as well as a little bit of screwing each other over to keep you on your toes. Lovely game.

Rating: 9/10

7: **Pan Am**

This isn’t a new game for me. I played it last year for the first time and was slightly puzzled. It was really hyped up for me as aviation is one of my foremost interests and thus I was really excited for it. So when I played it for the first time I wasn’t sure what to think of it. After a few more plays I really got the hang of it and I love it dearly.

Rating: 9/10

8: **Fantastic Factories**

Dice allocation immediately gets a high place on my list, and this is no exception. Brilliant fun and I want to play more of it.

Rating: 9/10

9: **Star Realms**

Fun little combat-based deck builder that has a special place in my heart even if I suck at it.

Rating: 9/10

10: **Wingspan**

Clever engine builder that obviously has a lot of heart put into it. I like the decision space a lot even though I typically make the wrong decisions :)

"Although I have been a somewhat experienced player for a few years, I have never found a game that gives me the same sensations as Catan, with its negotiation and trading aspects.  

I played it a lot with and without its extensions.  With my group of friends, we may test excellent different games according to others (Dune Imperium, Concordia, Wingspan, Arnak), there is always a moment when someone suggests Catan and most often everyone agrees (idk maybe we are strange).

I have tried looking for games with lesser known similar aspects such as:
-Moonrakers
-Rival Restaurants
-Chinatown
-La Casa Nostra

but none give us similar enjoyment.

"Link to Geeklist, for those who prefer to browse on BGG: https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/308923/50-new-me-games-ranked-2022

I want to be better at documenting the games I've played, more than just logging scores in an app. Since I happened to play exactly 50 new-to-me games this year, I thought it would be fitting to rank them in a ""top"" 50 countdown and do a short write-up of my impressions! Thanks for taking a look!

#50 Battle Line - I know this game is well loved, but I really didn’t click with it. The main hook of “battle is only resolved when it becomes impossible for a set to be beaten” felt weird and slow.

#49 Hibachi - Really wanted to like this one, the hook is cool. But it was too trudgy and not exciting enough for me in the dexterity realm.

#48 The Wolves - Very neat action selection mechanism, and the shifting scoring areas was cool. I actually dig a lot of the individual pieces here, but I think there wasn’t enough uncertainty, so the game felt a little grindy and too crunchy for the payoff.

#47 Lorenzo il Magnifico - Nothing much negative to say here, the combos are cool, it’s just not my style of game. A little too dry and heads-down for me.

#46 Brian Boru: High King of Ireland - The decision between winning tricks and losing them for better abilities is a good decision, but for me the actual area control wasn’t exciting enough.

#45 Blue Lagoon - Nothing against the game, but it was maybe a little too much to explain and keep track of for the weight I wanted it to be. Babylonia fits in the same space for me and it’s in my top 10-15 all time.

#44 Kleos - Really fun ideas here, but probably just too much to keep track of, and battles felt swingy and unfair.

#43 War of the Ring: The Card Game - Love the theme, and the tight hand management is great in theory. In practice it felt like there were too many moments of not actually being able to do anything at all, so several chapters felt arbitrarily decided.

#42 Cubitos - Fun little game, setup and teach were arduous for what the game delivers on. If I had a regular casual group, I can see it being fun to explore the variety on offer, but as is I thought it was fine.

#41 Senators - Was very much looking forward to this, and it was a disappointment. Love some of the ideas, and the The Estates style auction system is awesome, but the standard set collection scoring system killed it a little bit for me.

#40 Riftforce - Solid 2 player hand management game, but it felt drier than I was hoping. Just a hair more abstract/methodical compared to some of my favorite 2p card games (Blue Moon, Omen, Mindbug).

#39 Atlantis Rising (Second Edition) - This isn’t fair because I had to step away for the middle portion, but all of the neat asymmetry couldn’t really salvage the bog-standard worker placement recipe fulfillment for me.

#38 Gùgōng - Very solid, I really like the card play, but again it suffers not on it’s own merits, but my own tastes. Too euro to climb my list very high, but in the euro space, I like it more than many.

#37 The Red Cathedral - Similar to Gugong, I like it and it’s got some clever mechanisms. The interaction is great, but again just not in my preferred category of games.

#36 My City - I’m sure this would climb as I’ve only played one chapter, but as it stands it’s a very good filler, and a concept well-executed so far.

#35 The Guild of Merchant Explorers - Probably my favorite roll/flip &amp; write I’ve played so far. I hadn’t really liked any before I played it, so to make it this high is a testament to how much more fun I found it than most. The wildness of the special action cards is so good, it really elevates the experience for me.

#34 Long Shot: The Dice Game - Great little party game, it’s made friends whenever I’ve brought it out. It’s just slightly more complex than I’d be comfortable with for a true party game group, but as a party game for gamers it’s great.

#33 Pax Viking - Really want to dig into this more, the control of special abilities via map control, a la Oath or Clockwork Wars is something I desperately want to see more of.

#32 Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation - Great, tense little game. The special abilities are awesome, and the space for bluff and doublethink is super juicy.

#31 Cursed Court - Maybe slightly too dry to be top-tier for me, but the bidding system is wonderful and the shared information is a perfect mechanism here.

#30 Fairy Tale - Quick, brutal little drafting game. A little too much rules overhead and iconography to be an everyday play, but for what it sets out to accomplish I don’t think it can be beat. The emphasis on hate-drafting due to drafting 5 cards and only playing 3 is brilliant.

#29 Cryo - Multi-use cards and the clever worker-pullback system elevate this more than most euros for me. A gorgeous production and interesting, fairly coherent theme don’t hurt either.

#28 Clockwork Wars - Highly recommend trying for the hidden unit deployment and the crazy special abilities tied to map control. Gets a lot of rules right, and gets out of its own way. Not sure about the balance, but it feels like a different take on my favorite genre of troops-on-a-map.

#27 Stephenson's Rocket - Fairly easily parsed shared incentives, the decision to trade control now for future influence, and a beautiful production make this one of my favorite train games. Classic Knizia in its simple rules and complex scoring.

#26 Arcadia Quest - I really wish there was a shorter way to play this and still approximate the full experience. As a skirmish game it’s lavish, dice chucking fun, but I don’t know that it’s worth the campaign-style full game.

#25 Runebound (Third Edition) - I’ve been looking for a dumb, easy overworld adventure game and this might be the answer. It’s probably too long and too random, but sometimes you just want to run around, kill stuff, and get stronger. The abilities are amazing, I love games that give you wild and game breaking stuff to do.

#24 Massive Darkness 2: Hellscape - I played with too many people for a first play, and the wrong scenario, and it took WAY too long. But the central loop of dice chucking and constant influx of goodies via leveling up and loot, plus the radical mechanical asymmetry of the heroes was marvelous. Similar to the previous two entries, this is the dumb beer &amp; pretzels co-op I’ve been waiting for.

#23 Ghosts of Christmas - This year I hopped on some more advanced trick-takers since I’m very new to them, and I loved this game from the first play. I still have no idea how to play well, but the smart hook, easy teach, and interesting ripple effects make this a winner for me.

#22 Deus - The first game I acquired due to a Board Game Arena play. The central hook of discarding cards to power actions based on the amount discarded is really cool, and the massive card churn works here to give you options for the engine you’re building. This one feels like an underappreciated gem.

#21 Empyreal: Spells &amp; Steam - Crazy powers: the train game. I love wild abilities, and there’s enough in this box to explore for a while. It handles higher player counts well, which is a plus. I wish doing the cool thing and doing the smart thing were more often the same thing, but I think it’s very solid.

#20 Paint the Roses - I had no idea how much I’d like this game. The cooperative deduction works really well, and the ability to gain knowledge of any players requirement on every turn opens up the decision space nicely. 

#19 Caesar!: Seize Rome in 20 Minutes! - Fantastic 2 player filler game. The area control is direct and exciting and the decisions between control and special actions is delightful. I love the focused race of the victory condition. 

#18 Brick &amp; Mortar - The player-driven economy blew me away, as well as the crazy power combos. I would love to play more of this, but seeing immediate impact of players deciding to shift the market or their own focus was beautiful.

#17 Circus Flohcati - Excellent, excellent little push-your-luck game. Bone simple to teach, with decisions that aren’t too casual but aren’t complex. Immediately jumped near the top of my “to acquire” list.

#16 Sheepy Time - Only edges out Circus Flohcati due to the comboing of the special powers and the beautiful production. Probably a hair too much going on for absolute non-gamers, but I’ve had success with both my game group and family.

#15 Four Humours - Fascinating game, unlike anything else I know. The game does a great job of generating table talk, deceit, wheedling, and groaning throughout. Really really fun bluffing and deduction game.
#14 Capital Lux - Excellent card game, easy to teach with interesting decisions and plenty of interaction. The tension between playing cards for special powers while potentially opening up scoring for others, and playing for your own scoring is fantastic.
#13 Modern Art - Would love to acquire this and get it to the table more. I want to see how our valuations of art changes over multiple plays, but I love the hand management and timing considerations of the cardplay.

#12 John Company: Second Edition - Half of my group hated it, half loved it. It ran too long, was too procedural, and felt very arbitrary, and I am dying to play it again. The levers are all so interesting, and the mechanisms and space for negotiating are wonderful. It sits with Guards of Atlantis 2 for “game I’d most like to have a dedicated group for”.

#11 Radlands - Such a fun dueler. The card abilities are awesome, and the tight hand management makes this game shine. I can see some people bouncing off due to the random feeling of the large deck of cards, but I’ve loved every play and until Mindbug, it was my preferred easy dueler.

#10 Wonderland's War - I approached this game skeptically, but every element just fits together so nicely. The two phase round structure integrates both (very different) mechanisms cleanly, and the bag building/push your luck drives the area majority better than I expected. This was a big hit in my group, and deservedly so.

#9 Mindbug: First Contact - My new go-to dueler, and a game I have in my bag at all times. The extreme distillation of the genre suits me perfectly, and the hand management and simple, agonizing decisions are fun to wrestle with every time. Fantastic game.

#8 American Bookshop - Wow, this game blew me away. The ruleset is so simple, but the “bust” number combined with the majority scoring makes me feel like there’s value in every card, whether low, high or in the middle, and the game isn’t so much about winning tricks as it is trying to push certain people into winning tricks with certain cards. This comes in high and has a solid chance to climb.

#7 Turncoats - Similarly to Mindbug, the extreme distillation of the genre is amazing here. Brutally tough decisions, tight gameplay, doublethink, timing considerations, and leveraging indirect influence are all elements I love. Providing all of that in a 2 minute teach with a 10-15 minute playetime, for up to 5 players, is astounding. And the super portable, almost timeless production is wonderful.

#6 Cat in the Box: Deluxe Edition - My favorite trick taker (although my experience is very limited). The central hook is amazing, the hand management is marvelous, and the constant threat of the paradox makes every trick feel tight and tense. I can absolutely see this being a game I play for hours on a rainy afternoon.

#5 Yura Yura Penguin Mini - This game has caused more laughs, shouting, and inside jokes than any other this year, save one. Pitching it as “Uno: the dexterity game”, the adorable production, and portability has made it a staple in my rotation. There’s no group I wouldn’t play it with, and no time I wouldn’t play it. Marvelous game.

#4 Antike II - On theme for my top 10 new to me this year, Antike II gives me everything I want from a civilization game in a focused, clean, streamlined experience. I love the race to the victory conditions, and the decision between diversity and monopoly in your goals. The interaction is meaningful without being cruel, and the capacity to play in a short time frame, with snappy turns, even at a high player count is awesome.

#3 The Great Zimbabwe - In any other year, this would probably have topped my list. TGZ is everything I want from a heavy game: rules that make sense logically and allow for deep consideration without being spiky; interaction that is constant and important without being arbitrary; and a host of completely game breaking abilities. I wish more games used the tradeoff between truly wild powers at the cost of making your game harder to win, that is my single favorite element. This game will be in my collection forever.

#2 Guards of Atlantis II - This is probably the single best design of any game that was new to me this year. If I could have a group dedicated to only one game, this would probably be it. It’s hard to express just how deep, and exciting, every turn of every matchup feels if you haven’t played it. It only gets better with time, but experienced players are just as likely to make a critical error as newbies, so new players rarely feel totally out of their depth. It is a game about who will mess up first, and worst, and so it won’t be for everyone. Many will complain about the designers insistence that the game is truly designed to be played without reference materials, but the game is entirely designed around the lynchpin of “does she have 3, or 4, on the attack card she hasn’t played?” and it’s beautiful for that. There’s a reason one player in my group has played this game over a thousand times, would still play it every week with us, and doesn’t even have the best win rate of our group. It’s the best team game available, the best skirmish game I know of, and maybe the game I know that best accomplishes what it was designed to be.

#1 Magical Athlete - And finally, we have Magical Athlete. Like what TGZ is to heavy games, Magical Athlete gives me everything I want from a light game. Every single race is hilarious, raucous, and leaves us with a story to tell. More games need to live in the space where utterly absurd abilities interact, and Magical Athlete is just that. I love good decisions, and Magical Athlete has basically only 8-10 decisions in two different flavors in the entire game, but what it accomplishes via entertainment and watching the sandbox play out is so much fun. This is the only game I own that I’ve added fan content into, because the only thing better than watching a pool of 25 possible abilities interact is watching what happens when 125+ possible abilities interact. Magical Athlete delivers on my favorite things in gaming: sitting down with good friends, getting to the action in 5 minutes, and laughing and shouting at each other about dice rolls and impossible occurrences for an hour. Magical Athlete is easily in my top 10 of all time, and I think it always will be.",Ranked Top 50 New-to-Me 2022,1,self.boardgames,101k2t6,kingokip,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/101k2t6/ranked_top_50_newtome_2022/,1672685033

Early 2022 Nova Scotia, Canada, was still walking a fine line with Covid between ""all safe"" and ""shit is hitting the fan"" but I managed a steady gaming circle as well as started a weekly games night at the local community center where I got to meet new people and play a lot of games I haven't played before.

**1. Twilight Struggle (NR)** Early into the Covid Pandemic a bunch of us picked up a Humble Bundle of board games on Steam so we can still game together. One friend said we should check out Twilight Struggle and the rest is history. If you want strategy, skill, theme, tension, fun, and luck this has it all.I have over 300 games online since, a few disappointing tournament results and 50+ in-person games and Twilight Struggle is my only 10/10 game. 

**2. Terraforming Mars (-1)** Being honest, some of my love for TM is because it was my first ""real"" board game. I regularly attended board game nights at friends houses but nothing ever really grabbed me, most games were party games or really light. When I decided to start researching what I liked I settled on TM and it did not disappoint. Still being honest, the production value is junk. The artwork on the cards is so bad it's actually funny, the single layered player boards is an accident waiting to happen, and the cubes are just, okay. But if you make it further down this list you will see I am a fan of engine and tableau builders and this is the cream of the crop.

8/10

9.5/10 with prelude

**3. Brass: Lancashire (-)** When playing with the Iron Clays you just feel, rich, and being an extremely tight economical game I wouldn't have it any other way. The game is an intense, brain mushing, exercise in money management with multiple ways to victory that can change with every turn.

9/10

**4. Underwater Cities (+6)** I just love how streamlined this game is, and takes extra steps to get the game flowing without much downtime. How it limits your options by encouraging you to play colored cards that match the placement and a hand size of three really brings strategy into play instead of ""luck of the draw"". Almost every decision you make matters, play a matching colored card, upgrade a dome, build a tunnel, do I really need two desalination plants? hell yes! and it all accumulates into end game points. 

7.5/10

**5. Wingspan (+1)** The BGA release and the Asia expansion help Wingspan get a push in my rankings this year. It allows me to get regular group games in with friends and the usual weeknight loses to my wife with the duel mode in the latest expansion. I will never say no to a game of Wingspan (well maybe now with 6 and 7 player options I might) but with an in-house rule of loser has to clean up I regular feel the burn of this table hog.

8/10

**6. Lost Ruins of Arnak (-2)** Arnak deserves more plays then I can give it, especially with the new leaders so unfortunately it took a small drop in my top 10. As much as I enjoy this game I am just not good at it, well, not as good as some members of my group. I always want to play to learn a better strategy but as soon as the game starts all plans and suggestions fly out the window and I find myself only climbing the research track.

7/10

8.5/10 with Leaders

**7 Viticulture Essential Edition (-5)** Lets just say I bit off more then I can chew with Viticulture and now it is intimidating. My group really enjoyed this game and we still play it on BGA but I decided to go ""all in"" with the expansions and then the wine box with Viticulture World and now we have no idea where to start. That needs to change ASAP.

7/10 base game

**8. Ark Nova (NR)** What originally was purchased because of FOMO is quickly becoming a top 5 game for me so for those still wondering....yes, the hype is real. Ark Nova is one of those games that just clicks, it takes up a lot of table space and is intimidating but each component is familiar to even the light gamers. It pieces together hand management, puzzle building and engine building in a wonderful, welcoming theme that is hard to come by in a heavy euro game. 

7/10 

**9. Memoir '44 (NR)** I got M44 earlier this year and have played it a lot, in person and on BGA and was getting close to the point where I was getting tired of it. Then one day at a local game store I saw Breakthrough and grabbed it and WOW, this takes it the perfect step forward in strategy. More squads, more space, more terrain and the ability to move additional squads without attacking helps prepare you for battle.

8/10 base game

9/10 with Breakthrough

**10. Maracaibo (-5)** The base game offers several different strategies, the multi-use cards force you to change tactics each game, and with so many cards you barely dent the deck providing variability. The downfall, and the reason for the huge drop, is the effort it takes to set up, we try and streamline game nights as much as possible and this game just doesn't fit well for us in the middle of a marathon. 

7/10

"I know Root is a great game, I played with my friends copy of Root and tried the digital one and its great...but my friend says he wont be buying the expansions cuz hes a more Play then move on to the nexy game type of gamer.

I for one am interested in the expansions and new factions and thinking of buying myself a copy. I found someone nearby selling me :

-The Base Game
-Riverfolk Expansion
-Underworld Expansion
-Exiles and Partisans Deck
-Vagabond Pack
-Resin Clearings
-With the FS inserts
-Sleeved with Instructions and boxes intact

All for about $200. He said his playgroup werent into it and wants to bring it to us this Thursday.

Im kinda FOMOing here and I dont really know if its a good deal...and if I buy it Im not sure if Root is a ""lets play it weekly"" type of game.

My Gaming Group only plays Gloomhaven Regularly...other games we just cycle through our collections. Descent 2E hasnt been tabled in a long time. Aside from Gloomhaven...we dont usually find a game that has enough crunch or competitive 
edge for us to play to the ground thats why half our game nights we spend playing Commander (mtg).

I've been in the hobby for over 10 years. I’ve played, bought, sold, gifted and was gifted (and then sold when the gifter wasn't looking) many games. I keep my collection rather small. I have many friends that are also boardgamers and they have their own collections, some smaller, some bigger than mine. We meet often and usually don't buy the same games for that reason, so I have hundreds of games available to play. I will comment on those currently on my own shelf. Many games I have are in Polish, but I listed them in English below.

If you have questions about any of my games or want to suggest a game I might like, please do!

**1. Scythe** \- Love it. The common issue people have with this game - not a lot of actual combat - is a huge plus for me. We are not big on directly fighting each other, so it is always fun to just tease each other with mechs approaching and maybe attacking, maybe not, while focusing on covering the most ground and getting stars. I also love the look of this game 100%.

I prefer to play it with more people, but I played the Fenris campaign with just my SO. We liked it, but it was nothing special. Still, the modules and new factions it includes are a plus. I don't have airships and I don't think I need them, though I won't be mad if I get them as a gift.

**2. Rune Stones** \- I went to my first (and only so far) Essen Spiel and played that game there. I liked it and got it immediately. My favourite part is the hand management, you buy new cards quite easily, but each time you play cards to get something, you lose one of them. Your deck is changing all the time. It also has a great board and thematic actions that make it very easy for me to teach. Other than the board, the art is so ugly.

**3. Ishtar** \- My second Essen Spiel purchase. They had an amazing booth with an amazing store. Got the game after playing it, got an awesome boardgame bag as a freebie. Ishtar is pretty and quite tight, can feel a bit limited, you need to buy ways to score points and they shape your strategy. I actually feel I am getting better at it every time I play. I find it a bit clunky to teach though, due to all the rules of the tile placement and scoring.

**4. Terraforming Mars** \- Love it. Have almost all expansions in this box - a mistake, don’t like playing with them. They make the game too busy and it's not fun to reorganize the cards later. I like how more and more powerful my engine gets and how the players control the ending of the game. I’m also a sucker for space stuff.

**5. Lost Cities Roll &amp; Write** \- My SO is a big fan of roll &amp; writes, I like them good enough. This is our newest one, quite fun, easy to teach, some interesting choices to make while playing, ugly generic dice.

**6. Splendor Duel** \- Love it. Got it recently, played 10+ times, won only once (but it was always such a close call it's crazy), want to play more. I like it more than the regular Splendor.

**7. Calico** \- The worst. Beautiful production, but I never get the tiles I need. I like it, easy to teach, tense to play. I’m so bad at it! The cover cat looks a bit like our cat, 10/10.

**8. Seasons &amp; Path of Destiny** \- This game annoys me so much. Square cubes to mark round things. Scoring track with a weird shape for no reason. Too many duplicated cards for my liking. So many cards with effects you then have to micro-manage like crazy. I like to play it but only as a 2 person game. I don’t enjoy having to remind 3 people about their million ongoing affects that are in play and I don’t enjoy it even more if I don’t do that and then I hear “Oh no, I forgot to do X 3 rounds in a row, I think, can I do it now 3 times?” for the entire game. It's pretty and the heavy custom dice are cool. The theme of being a wizard is non-existent. But you can surely feel the seasons are changing!

**9. Cartographers &amp; Heroes** \- My favourite roll/flip &amp; write. Always fun to play, especially drawing all the idiotic monsters and big dicks on each other’s maps. Easy to teach, not that easy to win.

**10. The Quacks of Quedlinburg** \- Ugly but fun. Every game is a bit different thanks to multiple ways the ingredient tokens can work. I don't have any expansions, not really planning on getting them. Especially since everything fits so perfectly in a small toolbox I got.

**11. Railroad Ink** \- Great production and rather fun to play, but I am not that excited to play it often.

**12. Radlands** \- A newest gift, played it twice. Challenging hand management, rather quick, nice colors but ugly art. Liking it so far.

**13. Lotus** \- Saw Zee Garcia review it, mentioned to my SO that it looked cool, then got it for Valentines. You create flowers using cards, you win by controlling and finishing most of them. Pretty, original, I like it.

**14. Sagrada** \- Always willing to roll a bunch of dice. I have one expansion, not planning on getting more. My parents like it, so never getting rid of it.

**15. Photosynthesis** \- My SO hates it, I like it. The biggest plus - all these trees were so useful when I was DMing in person D&amp;D sessions! I like the elegant gameplay and easy rules, though it requires some thinking and can get frustrating.

**16. Tiny Epic Dungeons &amp; Stories** \- A dungeon crawler with miniatures that does not come in 5 huge boxes? Sign me up! I like it, though sometimes it feels a bit like a goblin management game and the loot could work better. But it is fun and I just got the expansion, excited to try more characters etc.

**17. Discworld: Ankh-Morpork** \- My favourite game with player-specific winning conditions. Always fun to teach and play, feels very thematic thanks to the cards. Got crazy expensive here, but I am not parting with my copy ever.

**18. Tzolk'in &amp; Tribes &amp; Prophecies** \- I like it but I know I could be better at it. Love the moving gears. “Jadę dalej” (“Keepin’ on ridin'” if I may translate so myself) is our favourite thing to say when playing it. I had it for many years now, just got an expansion as it was reprinted. I think variable player powers will make it more fun.

**19. Small World Underground** \- Friend had the regular Smallword, I liked it, didn’t want to buy the same thing, so I got the sequel. Friend sold her copy years ago. I like it, but I hate the rulebook. We always have some questions that aren’t answered anywhere. 

**20. Sushi Go** \- I teach that to people before showing them 7 Wonders. It is also always a fun game to end a long boardgame night with. I played Sushi Go Party recently and I like the simple set up of Sushi Go more.

**21. Sheriff of Nottingham** \- I enjoy playing it when I am in the mood to play it. Requires a good group and some roleplaying skills to work, but when it works, it is amazing and we talk about some sessions for months to come.

**22. Obscurio** \- Dixit with a traitor. It is not bad, but I am not a big fan, though I enjoy playing it with my SO's brothers, the accusations flying left and right then make it fun, especially when they fight among themselves and I am the traitor.

**23. 7 Wonders** \- 2nd edition is so pretty. The only game I sleeved so it looks even better (truth be told the cards just felt too thin). Always fun to play, but I HATE that the cards have no explanations on them and you have to refer to those big sheets explaining the symbols. You can see it in the eyes of completely new players that some of the cards overwhelm them. The cards are so big, couldn’t you fit a sentence or two there? Oh, Terraforming Mars, other games always remind me how perfect your cards are.

**24. Saboteur** \- The most party game of my games and my favourite light traitor game. Always fun to play on birthdays.

**25. Patchwork** \-  A fine game, but I got a bit bored of it. My SO doesn't want it gone so we compromised - we can sell it and then we will buy a different version, so we can still play Patchwork but at least it looks fresh. I want the pretty Polish Folklore one. Will put it up for sale soon.

**26. 7 Wonders Duel** \- Like it a lot, though now I'm all about that Splendor Duel. But it's a good game and fun to play.

**27. The Red Cathedral** – An awesome game in a perfect small box. I like it a lot, though I am not a fan of teaching it, it has some obscure and non-intuitive rules. I made a cheat sheet to help me with the teach. Pretty, nice components, beautiful art. I don’t think it needs an expansion.

**28. Lords of Waterdeep &amp; Scoundrels of Skullport** \- I love D&amp;D, I've been playing it 1-3 times per week for over the last 2 years. I got that game way before that, and getting into D&amp;D made me finally feel the theme and appreciate it more. I like it, I just wish it was based on 5e. Easy to teach, looks cool, played it lately with my main D&amp;D group when they visited my city, loved it so much.

**29. That's Pretty Clever! &amp; Twice as Clever!** \- Very fun and easy to play (sometimes pain to teach though) roll &amp; writes. There's a 3rd one, but 2 versions already feel like more than enough.

**30. Dixit** \- One of the first 3 games we got about 10 years ago (together with Discworld &amp; Enclave), it was a hit back then, now we sometimes play it during parties. I have several expansions inside that box. Not planning to get rid of it, but not getting more for sure.

**31. Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion** \- Regular Gloomhaven was not an option for me, so this was a must buy. Finished it with my SO, my sister and her husband, what an amazing experience. Then got and finished Gloomhaven digital with my SO. Now waiting for Frosthaven digital if it comes out, small Frosthaven if it comes out, and Gloomhaven RPG! Many things to wait ages for, well. I'm a big fan. This stays in my collection even though I do not plan to go through it again anytime soon (I would if I could buy new characters separately - especially our beloved Sexy Sun and Even Sexier Mr. Doom).

**32. Enclave** \- Went to a convention when I was still young, saw people teaching a game (I think they were the creators / publishers), sat down to play, liked it, got it. It got played a lot back then, now not so much, only for nostalgia reasons. You prepare for missions, you go on missions, you try not to fuck it up and get some loot and some points. It is fine, just nothing special.

**33. Forbidden Island** \- Was fun back in the day, now I am done with it, just put it up for sale. The fire artefact was perfect for my in person D&amp;D sessions though!

**34. Pandemic: Reign of Cthulhu** \- We laughed at it at first, but it is a very enjoyable game that we decided to keep over the regular Pandemic.

**35. Pandemic &amp; On the Brink** \- Played it a lot ages ago. Got disinterested after completing Pandemic Legacy 1 &amp; 2. It is a good game, and the first expansion has great components, I'm just done with it, put it up for sale.

**36. Pandemic Legacy: Seasons 1 &amp; 2** \- Amazing experience with friends, I will always remember it. I guess at some point I will throw them away, once I need space for new games. There are some nice components inside, but I have no use for them. Still, after all that Pandemic games over the last decade, I am not even interested in all the other versions etc. that came out.

**37. Room 25** \- Love it in a bigger group. We always play a 'Everyone for themselves but you can negotiate (and betray)' mode and have a great time. ""Go check what's there"" and pushing somebody to a new room is the classic opening move we love. Always willing to play it with the right crowd.

**38. Nemesis &amp; Aftermath &amp; Void Seeders &amp; Medic &amp; Terrain** \- My first Kickstarter. All the extra KS stuff is behind the Terrain expansion, got some comics as well. I got so much for much cheaper than the base game goes for. It spent some time on the shelf before getting to the table, but oh boy, once it did! Everyone I’ve played it with liked it a lot and said it was an amazing cinematic experience and way easier to understand than they expected. I find it easy to teach if people are willing to learn some things as we go and we always end up with some fun, tense story. Haven’t played Aftermath yet, don’t think I will. One group of friends liked it so much they got the Terrain expansion for us and said they want to play more. I had my doubts about keeping this game in the past, but it proved its worth to me for sure.

**39. Carcassonne** \- A classic I’ve used to play a lot on a small Ikea table. We stacked tiles or had some structures continuing on the floor. Several expansions squeezed into that box, the best one (Big Ghost Meeple You Can Make Cookies With) included. Not playing it much nowadays.

**40. Castles of Mad King Ludwig** \- No longer available regular version with Polish art. Friends like to mention how jealous they are. A good game, always fun to build something and try to do it well. Sometimes after the game we challenge ourselves to recreate our castles in The Sims and send each other our castle tour videos.

**41. Suburbia: Collector's Edition** \- My second KS, after Nemesis. Too big for what it is, but I like the game. During KS you could select your 5 player colors, so now I have 3 shades of green to choose from and I love it! Sometimes I think about trying to sell it and buying a regular version, but it stays for now, it is fun to play with my best friends as we all like building games.

**Tokaido** \- Just sold it. Had it in my collection for many years and got bored of it. A friend got Namiji and I like it more and another friend got both Tokaido expansions for their copy, which I will try the next time we meet, so I no longer saw a reason to keep my copy.

**Canvas &amp; Reflections** – Just ordered it. I was interested in this game but never so much as to buy it. Yesterday I saw a good promotion for the deluxe edition... Should arrive soon. I have several friends that will love it and we already scheduled a meeting. Can't wait.

**Unconscious Mind** \- Half of my current wishlist for 2023. Waiting for it to come out in retail, preferably to get published in Poland. Will watch some more reviews then and decide.

**Dungeons &amp; Dragons: The Yawning Portal** \- Second half of my current wishlist for 2023.

"**TLDR - Here's a simplified version of the Dune (2019) board game rules based on the** ***Dune: A Game of Conquest and Diplomacy*** **(2021) game rules, which is a much more simple, streamlined version of the game for casual players. This condenses the play time to 1-2hrs max and simplifies a lot of the daunting complexity of the rules:** [**https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/251633/dune-board-game-simplified-rules-casual-players-pl**](https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/251633/dune-board-game-simplified-rules-casual-players-pl)

So over Christmas I wanted to play an interesting board game with family/friends, and went and bought myself a copy of Gale Force Nine's Dune reprint of the classic 1979 game. I had absolutely no knowledge of the game other than it was meant to be good, and only when I got home and started reading about it did I realise this is probably not a game for people (such as myself) who have only played stuff like Monopoly/Risk before.

After worrying that I might not be able to get anyone to play it with me, I read that there was a different board game made to coincide with the release of the Denis Villeneuve film called *Dune: A Game of Conquest and Diplomacy*, which was a much simpler version of the game, more friendly for casual fans of the film/book. If only it was possible to play those rules with the game I had, not having to look at Timothée Chalamet's face all over the artwork!

I then stumbled upon a post by the user cfsanchez2 of boardgamegeek.com , who had done just that, listing which rules to change/ignore in order to do so. That document only listed the changes to the original rules, so I made a document to be a comprehensive ruleset that should hopefully have all you need to play the game, based on cfsanchez2's ruleset.

I originally made this for myself to help me get to grips with the game and use when playing for the first few times, but thought I'd upload it in case it's helpful for others who want a simplified introduction to the game. 

I found this to be a great way into the daunting rules of Dune. I've played it with friends who have no special interest in board games at all, and I've now played multiple times with them repeatedly asking to play again. It's a lot of fun and still has a lot of strategy, scheming etc. involved that invokes the full game. We played it with 4 players and it worked well, but I can imagine it being better with 5-6.

The beauty of this is that once you and the people you're playing with get to grips with these rules, you could easily move onto the full rules of the game having won them over. The limitations of these simplified rules become clear the more you play, so it really does give you an interest in playing the full version, while still giving you the option of playing a streamlined version of the game if you don't have the time/commitment for the full version.

Hopefully it gives a way to really open up the game to casual players who aren't sure about immediately making the plunge into the full game or aren't sure about finding people to play with.

"Hi folks, 

I was wondering about games that are naturally playable by elderlies with vision impairement. For example, a very basic game--ludo--can be played by elderlies because it is very easy to learn, it affords social play (because 4 people can play it), it does not need any dexterity (like jenga, suspend,etc), a lot is dependent on randomness (and hence less load on strategy). Are there any similar games?  


I was thinking of Knizia's Criss Cross game, but printed on a large paper. Do you know any games that match these criteria? Which games do you play with your elderlies with some vision impairement (grandparents, parents, neighbours, and so forth) that I can buy for my grandparents?

"So a quick rant: I have several friends who refuse to play Tabletop games, but for some reason, are totally down to play board games even if it’s one with 10-15 page instruction booklets. Honestly, at that point, I feel like playing D&amp;D or Starfinder shouldn’t be an issue!

Anyway, since I thought playing monopoly or similar games would be too easy and since they said they’d play anything, I randomly picked up a board game from our local store and everything just kind of dominoed after that. I fell in love with it and now I’m down the board game rabbit hole! I’ve done a ton of research and have bought several more as well as expansions for them, but I was wondering if people had any suggestions.

So far, in order, I’ve played:

Dragonrealm
The Night Cage
Wingspan
Pandemic
Mysterium
Evolution

I was thinking about picking up Unfathomable since I saw a video play of it and it looks interesting. I also love Eldtrich horror. I also know it’s a reskin of an older game (BSG) that was really popular. I also thought about Mansions of Madness. 

I would love some more suggestions. Like I’ve said, I’ve done research and I know some popular choices through websites such as Gloom/Frosthaven and Terraforming Mars, but I I would love to hear the average redditor’s favorites to help with my decision making!

In the Household RPG they use this mechanics where the success is guaranteed by having the same result on some dice: trivial is 2 same, impossible is 5 same.

Trying to figure it out, maybe someone can help define the probability?

Conditions: you roll 6 (six) dice, each dice has six sides - four suits (like classic cards), one blank (fits none) and one joker (fits all). So you can have two spades and one joker, which equals 3 successes.

"As we've done the past two years, I'm back with an infographic sharing my family's board game playing (and owning) stats for 2022!

We track our plays in the BGStats app on iOS, and to count as a play, at least one member of our nuclear family had to participate in it. We did count solo plays with a physical board game*, but did not count digital plays just against the AI/computer.

[Here is this year's infographic!](https://imgur.com/gUNxFti)

Here are quick links to [the 2021 post](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/rtkr5s/my_family_and_i_played_board_games_over_1000/) and [the 2020 post](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/kqaco3).

Feel free to ask any questions about our data and how we got here!  We have three kids (elementary into early middle school), we homeschool and include games in our homeschool curriculum. This year my work schedule and work stress was higher so we did end up playing less (plus after hitting 1000 plays last year, we were fine not going up up up every year).

Here are some good breakdowns: [number of players](https://imgur.com/PUBzTlm) we played with and also [days of the week](https://imgur.com/ebWswgu) we played on. These graphs all come from the BGStats app on iOS.

"Of course there’s embarrassment. If you’re playing with friends hopefully it’s not too much or you can just laugh it off but I’ve found the two times I’ve messed up rules particular people will not let it go. What’s worse is both of these players only commented on it when it didn’t benifit them but gladly complained to the whole table about how the game was unfair and thus virtually unplayable and just would not let up until I said “ok, we don’t have to keep playing, we can stop right now if you’re so bothered by a genuine accident on my part.” And usually they say something like “no it’s fine I’m just saying [explains why it’s not fine]” and I have to look them dead in the eye and say “then stop complaining about it. I don’t want to keep playing if you’re going to keep bringing it up.” Which of course makes me feel infinitely worse about the situation because now I’m embarrassed it looks like I took it personally and they act like it’s all cool and since they’re right it’s hard to argue with them— and I don’t want to argue, I just want to move on and keep playing. Generally we do “we will continue with these rules until next time when we will play the real way” and I think that’s fine but it makes me not want to play with these people. Especially when they ask for the rulebook like they think it’s a politer way of saying I don’t know how to play my game that I’ve played before so many times.

"I've been seeing a lot of lists lately of people ranking their favourite board games and thought I'd take a stab at ranking some of my most played two-player games that can be played under an hour. Some of these games are intended only for two while others have options for playing at two but can play with more. For context, I love playing really long (2-4 hour) board games like Underwater Cities, Ark Nova and A Feast for Odin (which all play great at two players) with friends, but most of my two-player board gaming happens with my wife who doesn't enjoy going past an hour. So in that spirit, I'll be evaluating games that can all be played in an hour or less.

**Splendor Duel (5/5):** This game is absolutely incredible. I would rate regular Splendor with no expansions as a 3/5 when playing with multiple people and a 2/5 with two players. However, Splendor Duel opens up with way more options, ways to interfere with your opponent, and thoughtful choices to make regarding taking tokens since you grab them from a board and take three in a row, column, or diagonal. With three victory conditions, there's lots of options and the cards are so diverse. I've only given it one play but it's probably the best two player game I have yet to play.

**Bohnanza Duel (4/5):** A fun departure from the regular Bohnanza. It involves some bluffing which is a cool addition and has some additional phases to it that regular Bohnanza doesn't. Only aspect I don't quite enjoy is constantly discarding and redrawing certain cards that you can use to score points based on how someone has set up their field. Instead of building toward getting points cards, it often makes more sense to just drop them and redraw every turn, hoping to score something. Other than that, it's a stellar game.

**7 Wonder Duel (4/5):** Another great addition that keeps the essence of the main game while adding new features. It's very geared toward ruining the plans of your opponent and countering their moves so if you enjoy that, it's a good buy. I've found that it can sour people on the gameplay though so I think you need the right people to play it with.

**Sushi Go Party (2/5):** While I enjoy the diversity of cards you can add which mixes up your play options, I don't feel like many of the cards were designed around playing with two players (which is fair). It's very easy to determine which cards to take and which to leave which makes the game pretty mundane after awhile.

**Everdell (4/5):** I just picked up the complete collection and have been having a blast playing this. While it still works fairly well at a two-player count, there are obviously some cards that are better balanced around having more people playing. Additionally, it can be hard to find the cards you want as the meadow doesn't move as frequently. That being said, my wife and I have been binging on this and having a great time. This might take you more than hour if you add expansions or spend more time thinking through your turns, but we regularly finish in between 45 minutes and an hour.

**Patchwork (4/5):** Always a solid game to play. The puzzling aspect is really fun and you can make some very high level plays to mess with your opponent and force them to make sub-optimal plays. This was the game that introduced me to two-player games and will always have a place in my heart.

**Arboretum (2/5):** If you haven't played this game, it's very simple but involves playing down cards to get points but then holding some cards in your hand as the person with the highest amount in their hand of each colour wins the highest run they placed of that colour. It doesn't translate well to two players despite being advertised for it since it becomes easy to tell which cards your opponent is holding by the end of the game. My wife really enjoyed this game but I'm not a fan at this player count.

**Barenpark (4/5):** This game became very popular in my friend group and it's easy to see why. It feels like a more fun Patchwork with more ability to plan ahead. It works well in a two-player setting, though there's less tension for snagging certain tiles or victory point conditions as there is in three or four players. This doesn't detract much from it though and I've really enjoyed giving it a go.

**Cascadia (4/5):** Another recent breakout game that has caught a lot of attention. While it works well still at two players, I find there's a lot less tension in achieving the highest number of tiles of one type than in three or four players.

**Fantasy Realms (3/5):** A really cool game with a fun concept of collecting the best set possible. I like this at higher player counts as you get to see more of the deck come through in the discard pile, but it's still a reasonable game at 2 and one of our go-to's to end a night.

**Blueprints (2/5):** This game is really cool conceptually and fun to play with 3 or 4 players. At two players, all the awards are worth two points and since you're only competing with one person, there's often ties for everything. I always enjoy bringing it out with people but it's not worth it at two players.

**Santorini (5/5):** I describe this game to people as chess, but fun. Maybe I'll get some flack for that but it's a game that rewards planning out a few turns in a row but each of the different god powers add a new flavour to each game. It becomes a slog at three players in my opinion and can suffer from kingmaking but two players is where it sits perfectly. A few of the powers could be better balanced but overall it's an incredibly well designed game with tons of replay value. Also a bonus in that the games are very short so you can play a few in an hour if you want.

Just picked up this amazing game and had a few brief play throughs. I have some questions I need clarification on. 
Can anyone help?

1. When a motion tracker card tells you to draw an endurance card do you have to follow the instructions on the endurance card that you drew or are you just supposed to do what the motion tracker card says? Also, can I add the drawn card to my hand if It’s beneficial?

2. When a card says place a tunnel token next to “this character” which character is it referring to If it is drawn on an alien turn?

3. Can I exhaust or recycle the cards in my hand at any time during my turn or must they be kept until I either equip them or a card opportunity arises allowing me to exhaust them? I just don’t understand the benefit of holding cards in your hand and shrinking the endurance deck during a marine turn.

4. If I unequip cards from my character do they automatically get recycled? I assume so, as exhausting them would not benefit me.

5. When would I ever want to use a pistol to attack if I have a main weapon?

6. With a grenade card when rolling for each model (and token) in that space, do I have to lower my aim after each roll? Or is attacking with the grenade considered one attack roll?

7. In the rescue missions there is an opportunity to use a tech roll to look at a computer if you succeed you get to look at one blip. Since all the blips are aliens in rescue missions (no newt) why would I want to do this?

8. When a character card says “on activation“ you have to take this action every turn right? If the action asks you to move do you have to move or can you decide not to do this action? If I have to do this move on activation each turn that would mean that Frost gets three actions per turn since his “on activation“ requires him to move two spaces. Is that correct?

9. Paying to equip. Doesn’t it make sense to keep the endurance deck stacked as much as possible? Why would I pay card cost to equip an extra weapon or gear when those will cost me to use them in battle? It appears as if players are being asked to pay twice here.

"Inspired by [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/100rzty/revitalize_old_games_with_new_maps/), I thought I'd share when I did something similar. Though I did more ambitious than just the board, which also means I didn't finish and instead abandoned the project.

But! I tried to create a Fantasy version of Eldritch Horror, meant to be played on Tabletop Simulator.

[A map of the world. Each of the territories has an idiosyncratic naming scheme with city names being random foreign words; Red is bugs, Purple is fruit, Green is colors. Portokali is Greek for Orange, both a color and a fruit.](https://preview.redd.it/4sxco3zwyh9a1.png?width=3000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bdf9c66026cef021ce02c827716381de3231b302)

One of the biggest problems with explaining what I did is that I don't actually take notes on any project I attempt. In fact I keep saying stuff, going back to check, and realizing my assumption of what I did was wrong and having to rewrite information.

The map is just randomly generated from [Azgaar's Fantasy Map Generator](https://azgaar.github.io/Fantasy-Map-Generator/). The map is mechanically distinct in ways that I'm not sure I should have done, but since I don't take notes, who knows why I did them. All the nodes are different and in different places with different connections, so this board is mechanically distinct. For instance, on the [original board](https://imgur.com/UJ0TKj8), spaces 9 (Wilderness), 13 (Ocean) and 21 (Wilderness) are dead ends. On my board only 4 (Wilderness) and 11 (Ocean) are dead ends. There's also nothing like the Heart of Africa—The Pyramids connection. In fact, there are only five Expeditions, not six.

The biggest change is what the city rewards are, which unfortunately for me means I can't just use existing city cards! For instance, Red in the original game is Europe, made up of London (Spawn Clues), Rome (Improve Will), and Istanbul (Improve Influence). Here, Red is Nest, made up of Parhenon (Improve all skills), Burj Aleaq (Defeat Monsters), and Zhuk (Gain Allies). This would result in a very different experience, and I'm not sure if it would be a better one or not! I never got as far as testing it.

Next, we have the Horror for this board!

[Yes, this is just Alduin with a name that references Gary Gygax. I was really trying to focus more on the mechanics with the fluff being something to give me focus.](https://preview.redd.it/674iwfld7i9a1.png?width=1723&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b66239908f1a96cf88b047ca0f46e914720eb84a)

Befitting the fantasy revamp, the Horror is an evil dragon that wants to destroy the world. You'll note the player characters are referred to as Adventurers instead of Investigators. I was planning on making conversions of them as well, but don't seem to have saved any of that.

The Cultists are pretty straightforward. Like it says, he's worshipped by ""Brigands and madmen who constantly seek to add to the hoard of the great dragon"". So when they beat you up, they steal your stuff. They also live in the wilderness and ambush travelers. If they're allowed to get too strong, they'll start plundering towns, shown by destroying parts of the Asset Deck. I also replaced the term Clue with Quest. To represent that the players were fantasy heroes going out and questing. The ""Great Hall Special Encounters"" were essentially going to Sovengard or whatever. Those were supposed to be places that Gagyx had devoured, leaving them to sink into the afterlife or whatever. The players lose when Gagyx has eaten the entire world. Though frankly I should probably have it be half the locations in the game, or maybe all city locations. Originally I was going to use Destruction Tokens from one of the expansions, but I decided against it.

[Nothing insightful to add.](https://preview.redd.it/3sss91se9i9a1.png?width=688&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0dd17c38ad06d29613508ea27a02c76a66414e8c)

And this is the one research card I made for Gagyx. Nothing really interesting, just sort of generic.

I had so much I planned to do, but got overwhelmed with all of it. I was going to make a handful of Adventurers, a few Spells, some Assets, and of course like eight cards for each of the necessary decks. One day I might go back to it.

"For some reason the isolation of Covid times made me buy many more boardgames than ever before. It doesn’t make sense, the moment I couldn’t play physical boardgames anymore, I started buying lots of them.  
The armchair psychologist in me thinks maybe longing for a social thing made me buy things that represent that social thing, even if it doesn’t lead to any actual social things.

So, my “shelf of shame” grew and grew and I felt quite bad about it for a while. It reminded me of all the fun I am missing. (My main boardgame group is with colleagues at work and we kept on playing through Covid times by playing online. But so many games are not available online.)

I changed my thinking around this, though, and don’t feel sad about those many unplayed games anymore. That’s because I realised there are other ways of enjoying those games, mostly anticipating playing them and enjoying them for their art.

Some games are a really nice piece of art that are a joy to just look at. I don’t generally see prettiness as a very important part of a game. But when it’s pretty it helps feeling good about it without necessarily the need to play. I can enjoy simply opening the box and admiring the pieces.

And I noticed that just looking at my boardgame corner fills me with joy. I don’t even need to play the games, just being reminded of them is enjoyable.

It obviously also happens sometimes that I buy a new game that I manage to play in real life and that turns out to be a huge disappointment. It’s interesting how looking forward to playing that game for the first time filled me with much more joy than actually playing it.  
It’s a human thing that we often focus on the two hours of disappointment of playing a game that we didn’t gel with instead of being happy about the weeks of endorphins from looking forward to playing it for the first time. I guess that’s the [peak-end rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak%E2%80%93end_rule) doing its thing.

Maybe we should be more aware of the hope and happiness games bring us even before they are ever played.  
I wonder if we should rename the “shelf of shame” to the “shelf of hope”?",Why I am not ashamed of my Shelf of Shame,1,self.boardgames,100t1ue,_selfthinker,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/100t1ue/why_i_am_not_ashamed_of_my_shelf_of_shame/,1672606191
" 

After seeing multiple *year in review* posts, I figured I might as well go ahead and post mine. For the most part, my girlfriend and I would play mostly The Game of Life, Ticket to Ride, or Sushi Roll (once we acquired it in 2021); those plays were far and few between. The game that really kicked off the hobby for us was Wingspan in February of 2022. From there, we watched a few YouTube videos, read some Reddit posts, and started to grow our collection and dive cautiously into the hobby. I love numbers, so I quickly turned to BGStats and BGG. This was the biggest turning point that really dragged us into the modern board game world. Seeing all of the content on BGG, especially that trending section on the front page, really opened our eyes. In 2022 alone, we were lucky enough to be able to grow our collection significantly, for better or worse. We played 73 new games. We still have a small shelf of shame, but we’ve done pretty well at not letting it grow out of control. It really is incredible what we have been missing out on all this time. We played over 200 hours and over 250 plays! Needless to say, we will be staying in the hobby for years to come. 

Almost all of the games that we had played in 2022 were between only the two of us. We played a couple of games solo and a couple with some friends, but we won’t really be counting those in this  post. The following will be reviews of our top 20 played games that we played in 2022, 2-player only (except for one game)!   
1. Wingspan - Wingspan was our biggest gateway game! It might not be the most exciting game in the world, it can be pretty quiet and solitaire-like.Sometimes, though, that’s just the game you need. It’s relaxing and easy to play but can also be crunchy when you really focus on building your best engine. With the Asia expansion, we have shifted to primarily playing the new 2 player mode; it adds just enough player interaction where it’s still relaxing, but also reminds us that we have someone to play against. 

2. Etherfields - We have been playing this game only with the updated rulebook and it has been a joy. It does get repetitive after a while, which can lead to some dread if you’re trying to really get through it after a while. But we love it. We have yet to finish it, but we do plan to get back to it soon. We bought a board game table for this game so that we could keep it out, but missed being able to play other games on it due to Etherfields always being out. The story, while it does come and go, is very interesting; it occasionally reminded me of American McGee’s Alice. The campaign is so long, I really don’t know that an added expansion is worth it. I would start with just the base game and then go from there. 

3. Viticulture - My parents love wine. Every year my family gets together to pick up a ton (or more) of grapes and make wine. It is because of this that I bought this game for my parents. They had yet to play it when I decided that I should probably get a copy and learn to play it so that I could teach them. I ended up absolutely loving this game. It is such a treat to plant your vines, grow your grapes, make some wine, age everything. It’s fantastic. We still struggle with Viticulture World for some reason, but I swear we will conquer it one day. It’s not as easy to pickup as Wingspan, but I would still recommend this game to anyone that wants a bit more crunch to their game nights.

4. Dungeons, Dice, &amp; Danger - This game is really fun and I hope that they release more expansion maps. It is such an easy game to table and it is, most of the time, pretty relaxing to play. 

5. Rolling Realms - This one is one of my favorites, but it can feel like a lot due to the different realm rules. That being said, each new realm adds even more life to this game and I love it. I can’t wait for more.

6. Carcassonne - At one point, my girlfriend mentioned that she really enjoyed this game when she played it years ago. I decided that was good enough of a reason to grab the big box. It is a very fun, relaxing, large game that I would recommend playing on the floor due to the space it can take up. Depending on what tiles/rules you are using, it is also a very easy game to teach.

7. Cascadia - This game is very easy to learn and has a lot of replayability due to the different scoring cards that exist. For some reason, we only use the A cards, but I’m sure that the other ones are just as great. This one is just really easy to table and is relaxing after a long day of work or early in the morning.

8. Railroad Ink Deep Blue - My girlfriend loves this game. We are still debating if we just want to get one of the Challenge boxes or go for the big, collector’s edition. This game is very easy to teach and is very portable. While we are mostly home bodies, we will more than likely be taking this on our next vacation.

9. Bandido - While this one is a fun, easy game to learn and play, it is extremely hard to win. We cannot wait to add Bandida to the mix! This is 100% a floor game. We have gotten lucky when playing it on a table a couple of times, but we’ve  been very close to running out of space. 

10. Smitten - Smitten is a very fast game to play and is super easy to teach and table. It’s not necessarily our favorite game, but because of it’s speed it can be a no brainer when we just want a quick game that doesn’t require a ton of though. That’s not to say that it’s always easy to win, though.

11. Destinies - Destinies can be really fun and irritating at the same time. It is a relatively long game. Having to find the mini you are looking for is annoying, especially having to go between boxes with the expansions. And, your opponent reaching their final goal before you can be a bear. But overall, this game is fun, relaxing, and the story is engaging! We just received Myth &amp; Folklore for Christmas and can’t wait to table it!

12. Hostage Negotiator - This game is the only 1-player only game that we currently have, but it won’t be the last. We do play a couple of the other games on this list solo, but it’s pretty negligible compared to this one. 

If you like games with a lot of luck, this is the one for you. I have caused the death of so many hostages I lost count, but I just keep  coming back to play more! I got a little burnt out after playing Career, but I would also say that was the best way to play! They really did a great job of making the game longer and meatier. Final Girl is definitely on my radar!

13. Nemesis: Lockdown (and Nemesis) - We both absolutely love this game. This is my #1 favorite game and one of my girlfriend’s tops. We mostly play this game coop and love every second of it. The tension at our table during bag development or any noise roll makes the game worth it every time. Lockdown is usually our preferred game, but both are great. I feel as though Lockdown is an easier game to avoid aliens, but Nemesis is just noise tokens and aliens everywhere! Including plays of original Nemesis, this series is tied for our 5th most played game with the rest of our games that we have played 9 times!

14. Whitehall Mystery - This one is a ton of fun to play. It can be really easy and really hard at the same time. It’s a relatively quick game, too, so you can play multiple times in the same session easily if you both want to take a turn switching sides.We were thinking about getting Whitechappel, but I think that we are now leaning more towards Mind Mgmt for a longer game like this.

15. Mansions of Madness - I really can never get into this game but my girlfriend really likes it. We grabbed this one after playing, and horribly losing, Eldritch Horror. It does tell a good story, I just feel as though the games are longer and harder than I’d like for a story/app based horror game with a lot of pieces being added and removed constantly for the story to progress.

16. Obsession - We are definitely obsessed with this game and can’t wait to see what Dan Hallagan has in store for us this year! It is a lighter tile and worker placement game with some crunchy engine building. There really are multiple ways to win this game that can really make it hard to keep up with your opponent at times.

17. Paint the Roses - This game has been a great little game for us to play. It’s easy to table and much better suited for two players than a lot of our other games.

18. My Father’s Work - At this point, it should be no secret that worker placement is one of our favorite mechanics and this game does it for us! I love the story telling, though the writing is rough. The app is painful at times, the voiceover is basically pointless for the amount of reading you still have to do, but the components and mechanics are so fantastic that it makes up for the problems. There really are so many different outcomes in this game that there are still a ton of pieces that I’ve never gotten to use before! It is a long game, but it is very worth it.

19. Parks - Parks is very reminiscent of Tokaido. It’s easily a favorite game and I love the way that the turns take place. It does have moments where it is relaxing but it can also be a bit more competitive than other games like it. The expansions are also great and add a lot of worthwhile content to the game.

20. Radlands - This one doesn’t get tabled enough. It is very competitive and fun and very different than the games we normally play together. Having completely different camps and cards to play every game gives it huge replayability. If you  do think about grabbing this one, it’s definitely doable without the play mats, but I would suggest grabbing them. It makes the game a but easier to teach as well as playing in general. There are a lot of cards to keep track of in front of you and if you aren’t used to games like this it can be a lot. 

Honorable mentions:  
Moonrakers - We backed Moonrakers Titan and have been waiting to play it for months now. We finally caved and decided to try it on TTS, which we probably should have done first anyway before going all in. This was 100% worth backing. Even at 2-players this game was so fun to play! I really hope that we can play it with more than 2 soon.

Hamlet - We watched a Thinker Themer video where they mentioned Maggie being so happy to play Hamlet and how great the game was, we had to check it out. The BGG reviews look pretty rough, so we tried it out on TTS. It is now in my top 5! Halfway through our first play of the game, I ordered a copy of the game. Once the game comes in, we’ll see if the pieces really are a problem like the BGG reviews seem to say, but on TTS the game is a blast and I would easily recommend it to anyone that loves worker placement. I really really cannot wait to see what’s in store for the expansion for this one. Viticulture was my preferred worker placement game, but this one just might be edging it out. Time will tell!

"The beginning of 2023 is a little bittersweet for me. On the positive side, my wife and I have decided to make the leap to move to one of our favorite places in the world, the Central Oregon Coast. It's a place we both love and have wanted to live for quite some time, so once we knew it was feasible, we jumped at the opportunity.

That decision, however, is balanced by the fact that we're leaving behind not only the best gaming group we've ever had, but the best gaming *space* we've ever had; a space we've been designing and curating for well over a decade now. 

So this is what our current game library and game space looks like. Within the next week or two this will all be dismantled and packed up to make space for us to fix up our house for sale.

I've been an avid gamer most of my life, starting with games like Risk and Axis &amp; Allies way back in the late '80s. When it comes to ""modern"" gaming, that started, like it does with most folks, with **Settlers of Catan** in '98 or '99. Our library ballooned once we had more space for it, and about 15 years ago we hit 60 games, which we thought was nuts at the time. Since then, we've been up as high as 380 (which is, frankly, absolutely ridiculous), and this selection is what we've curated down to and will be taking with us in the move, about 190 games.

My favorite games tend to be dice drafting/dice placement games like **Coimbra**, **Grand Austria Hotel**, and **Pulsar 2849.** Lately, my most played game by far has been **Ark Nova**, but I've also gotten quite a few plays of **Dune Imperium** and **Foundations of Rome**, which I absolutely love.

My wife's favorites lean more into resource management games. Some of her favorites over the years have been **Tzolk'in**, **Archipelago**, and **Viticulture**, with her #1 favorite still being **Takenoko**. Lately she's been obsessed with **Flamecraft**.

Honestly, I don't think there's much of anything we'd change about the *contents* of our library, at the moment, but - as you can see by some of the boxes in these photos - I'm in the process of re-boxing a bunch of games to standardize sizes and condense contents. I've posted a bunch in the past about some of my reboxing projects, and that's really my little niche passion within this niche hobby.

As you can see from the shelves, we're the exact target market for massively overproduced deluxe editions of games, a passion that began when we received our copy of the **SmallWorld Designers Edition**. I've been away from the online scene for a while dealing with life stuff, but I once garnered a reputation for being the ""metal coin guy"", as I've added metal coins and custom poker chips to nearly every game I own that uses currency.

We've spent well over a decade acquiring, selling, and curating games for this library, and it's now down to pretty much only games that we would play without hesitation if suggested. It's definitely a large library, but we've found over the years that we prefer breadth of options over a narrow but deep selection.

But now we'll be moving to a place with a small, nascent gaming community, and it'll be hard to build what we have in the Seattle area, which has one of the most robust board gaming communities in the country. We'll definitely manage, but it's going to be a long road to get us back to anything like what we have here. 

We can only hope that whatever new house we buy will have a space where we can make something even better. I'm looking forward to the journey. This is, without a doubt, the biggest life change for me since moving out of my parents' house after high school, or getting married.

Although bittersweet, I'm genuinely looking forward to this new adventure. I hope 2023 brings new adventures, health and good fortune, and a ton of awesome gaming to you and yours. Thanks for checking out my collection.

"tl;dr: do you think 80 cm (width, could maybe go up to 100 cm) × 60 cm (depth, could maybe go up to 70 cm) × 6 cm (height) is enough to play most solos (Marvel Champions, Arkham Horror, Jaws of the Lion, Tainted Grail, maybe Euthia 😅).

Hi! I love solo campaign board games but lives in a small flat with 2 kids and a wife. We have absolutely ZERO spare space, and not that much free time either. Playing a full 2 hours straight is something I very rarely have, so the idea of setting up a big chapter just to most likely being unable to finish it at once, having to store it back and set it up again later... It's discouraging.

So I came up with this idea to make a drawer under my desk, high enough to keep the game set up but not too much to let my knees quiet, deep and wide enough to store the game. It would basically be the max size available between desk's legs do 60-70 cm deep, 80-100 cm wide, 5-6 cm high. If it works well, I could just pull the drawer for my gaming sessions, and just push it each time I need to pause and go back later. The only thing I'm wondering is: is this size actually enough? I'm really unsure it sounds smaller than what I hoped initially.

"I'm always ranking things, and every year I look forward to my end-of-year rankings, but I never thought to post them to Reddit. The recent trend of people posting their end-of-year lists inspired me to post my own here. Initially I was frustrated that so many other lists were ""New To Me"" lists rather than a more traditional New Releases. But I had older games new to me that I wanted to talk about as well. So I decided to do both. For my Top10 new to me games I've done a little write-up of each. Then at the bottom I've also summarised my Top10 games that were released this year, including the 5 that featured in the first list. So without further ado;

**1. Veiled Fate** (released 2022)

This was my most anticipated Kickstarter game and it did not disappoint. There's a group of 9 demigods on the board, being committed to quests for either positive or negative ends. On your turn you can move any of the demigods you want. The catch is that you are secretly one of them, so you have to stealthily ensure its your demigod getting the most points without giving your identity away. I love that deduction/bluffing element that keeps you guessing right up to the end.

**2. Cthulhu Death May Die**

We bought this one for Halloween because we didn't have enough horror-themed games. Thematically this is similar to Arkham Horror; you're investigators trying to disrupt a ritual to summon an Elder God from Lovecraft lore. But while that game is more investigation-driven, Death May Die is more action-packed. You shoot Cthulhu in the face in the face with dice rolls, and the more sanity you lose the faster you level up and become more powerful. But for me this game shines because of its modularity. Grab an Elder One, grab a scenario, pick your investigator, shuffle it all up together and go. Limitless possibilities.

**3. On Mars**

This was probably my biggest purchase at UKGE this (last?) year, which was my first gaming convention. It had been on my list for a while and I didn't hesitate as soon as I saw it and all its promos lying there begging for my wallet. It's a hefty beast with beautiful screen-printed components where you compete in the colonisation of Mars. The expansion that adds an alien race and various co-op modes only improves upon the experience and the game's scope.

**4. Etherfields**

There's a bit of drama behind this one, but I won't get into the weeds. All I'll say is I ended up spending more on it than I wanted, but ended up with more content as well. And I have absolutely no regrets. In Etherfields you're stuck in a dreamworld trying to remember who you are and find your way out. Each dream you enter offers a new escape-room type puzzle exhibiting a staggering amount of creativity and imagination.

**5. Heat: Pedal to the Metal** (released 2022)

One of my favourite memories of going to my grandparents was the copy of Waddingtons Formula One game they had from the 60s. Set your speed and try not to spin out round the corners. Simple. I've been hunting for a more modernised version for the last couple of years, and finally one was released, and it's based on 1960s Formula One racing to boot! It's fast and simple to play with a number of modules to level it up and make it a pure joy for anyone at any skill level. High recommendation.

**6. Ark Nova**

This was widely regarded one of the best games of 2021, but released late and sold-out fast meant we didn't get a hold of it until quite late this summer (it wasn't even at UKGE). You're building out a zoo, gathering sponsors, and fulfilling the needs of your animals. Fundamentally it's a race trying to be first to cross your two scoring tracks with one another. I can certainly understand the hype. It's lengthy and a bit of a brain-burner, but really fun, and of course the theme takes me back to the golden days of Zoo Tycoon.

**7. Keep The Heroes Out** (released 2022)

This was my biggest surprise of the year by far. I spontaneously backed it on Kickstarter in 2021 purely for the adorable wooden meeples. I had no anticipation of it actually being a decent game, but it arrived and I was blown away by how good it actually was. You're the monsters of a DnD-type dungeon, trying to defend it against the onslaught of heroes looking for fame and fortune. Of course the aesthetics are a big reason why I enjoy this, but mechanically it just sings as well. This was the tower defence game I never knew I was looking for.

**8. Steamwatchers**

I had no interest until I arrived at UKGE and saw it all out on display. They didn't have enough time to demo it for me, but I was so drawn in by what I had seen. The only issue was how expensive it was and how much money I'd already spent that weekend. I gave in right at the eleventh hour and I'm glad I did. A gorgeous area control game set in a post-apocalyptic ice-land where steam and heat is the most valuable resource, and each faction is vying for control of the land in order to exploit the steam vents as they emerge, before they peter out. I recently acquired the expansions for this (as in, two days ago), but haven't managed to try them out yet, but I'm excited to.

**9. Undaunted Stalingrad** (released 2022)

This is my newest entry to the list, and it almost feels like cheating including it here as we're only 4 scenarios through a 16 scenario campaign. It's the third in the series, but my first exposure to the system, which applies deckbuilding to historical WWII, in this case the conflicts between the Soviets and Wehrmacht in the city of Stalingrad. I have my reservations and doubts with it, but I've ended all four games happy and eager for the next one.

**10. Foundations of Rome** (released 2022)

This is probably my biggest game in my collection, physically. It's so big I can't even take it to people's houses to play. It's a Tetris-like game competing for spaces in early Rome to build your buildings, each of which represented by detailed miniatures in your own storage tray. It's simple to learn, but filled with a surprising amount of depth. As excessive as its production is, it's more than just big and flashy. They could make a version with cardboard tiles and it would still be a great game.

And finally my Top10 brand new releases;

1. Veiled Fate

2. Heat: Pedal to the Metal

3. Keep the Heroes Out

4. Endless Winter

5. Wonderlands War

6. Undaunted Stalingrad

7. Mythic Mischief

8. Foundations of Rome

9. Flamecraft

10. Hidden Leaders

&amp;#x200B;

Endless Winter is another member of the Worker Placement/Deckbuilding genre, this time with a fixed market and an interesting worker placement mechanism. There's also a bit of area control and set collection. I already played it on TTS before I backed it so all I was missing were expansions and the physical components, neither of which disappointed.  


Wonderlands War takes Quacks of Quedlinburg and applies it to an area control wargame in the setting of Alice in Wonderland. Even now it still seems like such a novel combination of mechanisms. Just like with Endless Winter I had already tried it out on TTS, and also just like Endless Winter the quality of components absolutely did not disappoint.  


Mythic Mischief was the second game by IV Studios to come out last year. I wasn't too interested in it initially, but I'll admit the hype from content creators got to me. It doesn't live up to their lofty heights (surprise surprise), but it's still a thoroughly engaging thematic abstract (if such a thing can exist). Absolutely not recommended for those with AP issues though.  


Flamecraft is a light game that feels a little overproduced, but I still enjoy my time with it. It's the kind of game I'll slap on the table if I want to relax and have a nice positive experience with the people around the table. I enjoy how it's all about that positive interaction and sharing resources for points. Makes for a wholesome gameplay experience perfectly in-keeping with it's charming art.  


Hidden Leaders is another deduction type game based on a tug-of-war on the small central board. You play cards moving the two markers up and down in order to reach a victory condition for one of two factions you're secretly dealt at the start. The game ends when a certain number of cards are played face-up, so much of the decisions come down to whether you're ready to end the game or not, or need to find a way of elongating (or shortening) it to get the best result for you.

"Hey! This is a question for anyone into 18xx. I really want to get into this genre of games and I believe I've found a good price for 2 of them as mentioned in the title. The problem is everywhere I kept reading that 1862 is a horrible place to start 18xx journey as it's very complex even for a 18xx game. As for 1846, they say the game is very company focused and not very deep in stock manipulation. I have also heard that both these games are a departure from what 18xx games usually feel like.

Which game do you think I should go for considering the following points:

• I don't mind the game being very hard
• I would like a balance with some amount of stock market manipulation and screwing others over and also making a good company.
• Something that my group of heavy gamers can pick up on even if they haven't played an 18xx in their life
• this might be the only 18xx game I own.
• I have over 150 other games so maybe this wouldn't get tabled as often (unless it's THAT good).
• a game that really feels closest to an 18xx experience.

Any opinion is much appreciated! Thanks!",1846 or 1862 for a heavy euro gaming group?,1,self.boardgames,100l8gl,deathglister,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/100l8gl/1846_or_1862_for_a_heavy_euro_gaming_group/,1672584849

##FAQ

**I live in Guatemala/Canada/Honduras/USA, why are you posting on a Saturday?!**

Because I'm writing this from Europe in the future where it's already Sunday. Timezones be crazy.

**Why are there a bunch of non-board games in the board game list?**

Because the Tabletop games category on Kickstarter includes anything remotely related to board games and sometimes things slip through my filters.

**Why is this future award winning board game and literal saviour of humanity missing from your list?**

Sometimes my filters get a bit overzealous and discard actually valid projects. If you feel something is missing for this reason, leave a comment and I'll add it (maybe).

**Can I donate all my money to you?**

No

**Can you help me promote my game?**

Please no. I make lists. Nothing more.

**Your list is full of errors and now my printer is out of cyan and won't print!**

Indeed, this fine piece of code runs purely on thoughts and prayers, so anything can happen. Leave a comment and I'll see what I can do.

"For those of you who may have been keeping an eye on Kingdoms Forlorn, any further thoughts? 

I for one, am the fence but about to fall off, for a few reasons: 

1. I already own ATO and from what I can gather, a lot of mechanics are shared between the two games. Thematically, I’m not the biggest fan of the medieval themes coming through KF. 

2. Probably goes without being said, extremely steep price point. Ranges from $185 shipped for the core pledge to $550 to the all in (I’m looking at US shipping)

3. Miniature glut. Won’t go into this too much as it’s clearly a matter of personal preference but I’ve had my fill of minis and at this point would prefer acrylic or even cardboard standees with bright colors instead of a sea of gray unpainted miniatures. More importantly, I’m sick of the shelf space needed to hold these games. (Shout out to vagrantsong for being a “normal sized” boss battler.)

4. Middling reviews. This one is tough because the only content on YouTube is from reviewers who were sent prototypes at the start of 2022 (happy new year 🎉). Ultimately a large number of them were fairly lukewarm with their reception with a few of them being honest with their disappointment. They did highlight what they would like to see changed or fixed in the final version so it’s very possible their feedback would be incorporated into edits.

—-

On the other hand, ITU hit it out of the park with ATO and it seems that KF is really riding on the success of its predecessor. I might be more inclined to give KF a shot based purely on their rep if the price point wasn’t as steep.

"My wife and I play mostly 2 player.  When we have family over, usually for the holidays, the player count will go up.  This is what we played this year, and really, some of these numbers are pathetic, but I wanted to add them anyway.  We had a total of 225 plays for 2022.  I didn't break families down, because I didn't want to add that many items. Families include Dominion, Carcassonne, Wingspan, Azul, and Quacks.  We bought and set up Sleeping Gods, and we played it for around 8 or 9 hours total, but finally put it away, because I couldn't deal with the dining table being taken up any more.  We didn't finish but will at a later date.  Our favorite is the family of Dominion.  The crap game on this list is Worst-Case Scenario Survival Game.  My wife picked it up for 3 cents somewhere, and I can say it was worth every penny.

"2022 was a very active year for me, as far as games are concerned. I started playing solo, I started branching out to different play groups, and I started actively tracking my gameplay data to make sure that the games I own actually get played.  The deep dive into boardgames started a few years ago (transitioning away from other hobbies) and it's currently the thing I spend most of my time on besides work and my significant other. One thing you'll hopefully see reflected is the fact that it has allowed me to see, meet and game with all kinds of wonderful people who I would have likely seen much less of otherwise. It really has been a blessing in that way :). Here's a year's worth of data for you, hopefully we'll be able to have some fun with this together.

**Collection stats:**
Games owned at the start of the year: 116
Games owned at the end of the year: 119
% of collection turned over: 51%
% of collection played: 98%
Number of unplayed games: 2

With my current collection at ~120 (with some bits and bobs on the way) I'm currently looking to stay close to that number, mostly because I'm expecting that I'll turn over plenty games the coming year and I don't want to own games simply to own games. That means that even though I buy a bunch of games during the year, I pay for those games by selling or trading the ones I no longer want or need. It's a system that has worked well for me so far. ~120 is a lot of games though, and I'm going to try to play everything I own at least twice the coming year. That means that I'll have to be very critical of what has to go and what gets to stay. As for the unplayed games, one of those games was new during the last few weeks (Vagrantsong), the other one is Eldritch Horror, and I've got a date to play both early January. Not a bad score if you ask me!

**Gameplay stats:**
Number of plays: 616
Most games played in: January
Most games played on a single day: 12
Number of different players: 48*
Most plays with same player: 158
Number of games played: 216
Number of new to me games: 139**

*Actual number higher
**Actual number lower

I've been very lucky to have many friends that like playing games with me, and I've found a boardgame night filled with people who are kind, patient and who don't mind indulging me when I bring something new and weird. It's really great. The number of players I've actually played games with is a bit higher, because the people I play with at the game night are unnamed (though that will probably change next year). The amount of new to me games is definitely lower, as there were a bunch of games I played this year that had simply not yet been recorded in the app I use to track my plays. However, it is true that I've bought and quickly sold at least some percentage of games I've bought this year, which is not the most effective way to spend my time and money. I'm going to track the games I buy and games I sell for 2023, so that I also have data on how that process takes place. Hopefully that will help me make better choices in 2024 and allow me to buy fewer games that will only get sold on.

**Five most played games:** 
5. Five games with 8 plays
4. Four games with 9 plays
3. Kabuto Sumo -  15 plays
2. Mini Rogue - 16 plays
1. Claim - 19 plays

I'm not surprised by this list, mostly because these games are pretty much all very accessible and fun. My favourite part about the 19 Claim plays is that I pretty much exclusively played Claim with one colleague at work. Claim is really good, guys. 

**Five least enjoyable plays of the year:**  
5. $hark
4. Ligretto
3. Empire
2. Terraforming Mars
1. Confusion

Okay, these games. Let me briefly walk you through what I did not like:
- $hark looked promising, but the dice rolls made it impossible to plan anything. That lead to each of the decisions you *could* make (namely buying and selling stocks) being straightforward and boring. Very sad this wasn't better. 
- I'm not very good at tracking a lot of quickly changing real-time information, and Ligretto was all about that. I played it seven times and liked it less each time.  
- Empire was just very boring. I had waited a long time before the Kickstarter delivered, and it was such a dud. Would actively dissuade people from playing this.  
- I think I just had bad luck, but man oh man did I have a bad time playing Terraforming Mars. My company sucked because I had no idea what I was doing, for some reason we were playing without milestones because the person teaching thought that was too complicated for a first play, and two players at the table had analysis paralysis. I was stuck just watching players shuffle around cubes for four hours before the sweet release of death. I threw a nuke at Mars and all that happened was the planet got warmer. *What*.  
- Confusion is just absolute trash. I got it for free and still overpaid. So, so bad.  

**Five favourite games that were released this year:**  
5. Long Shot: the Dice Game
4. Bear Raid
3. Sodalis
2. Wonderland's War
1. John Company

Not that many surprises in this list, as it pretty closely correlates with my top 40 list I did recently. The only new game to potentially show up here compared to that list is Vagrantsong, which I was recently given for my birthday :). Haven't played it yet though, but hopefully soon! One thing of note to me is that four of these games originated on Crowdfunding (although I held off on Wonderland's War when it was on Crowdfunding), which does imply a certain potential bias. Very curious to see how many of these will stick around this year, and how many games will come from crowdfunding next year.

**New years resolutions for 2023:**
- cut down more on games with similar mechanics, even if some of the cuts are painful. 
- play all my games twice. 
- end the year with at most 130 games, preferably as close to 115 as possible.

I think all three of these resolutions will help and keep the collection filled with games that actually see play and that other people are eager to play as well. As happens when you really like something, I ended up having a bunch of games that were very similar (multiple trick taking games, for example, and multiple auction games) which I don't feel have done enough to fully differentiate themselves from each other. At that point, I do feel like I'll end up having games that I own simply because I haven't gotten rid of them yet. It's going to be important to properly look in the mirror and make some hard cuts this coming year.",2022- a year's worth of play and collection data,1,self.boardgames,100f24a,DarkJjay,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/100f24a/2022_a_years_worth_of_play_and_collection_data/,1672560589

"A debate sparked up over the proper sequence of events that occurs when triggering a monster in the night cage.

A monster illuminated by one and only one person is placed to the left of a T shaped pat. To the right is a straight path.
Below is a pit. 
The arguement was over the when a monster is discarded.

I stated that if a charecter were to move right they would move and then be hit by the monster.

My friend believed that since the monster would no longer be illuminated immediately after moving that it would not trigger an attack.

"Hello, playing dominant species tonight. In a previous game the teacher undid a move and redid it to be better after another player asked a question. I gave a lot of shit about this because as the teacher he has an advantage in a new game already.

Now in dominant species I did the same thing saying he set a precedent and this is not chess.

The rule book does not say one way or the other. Blood bowl rulebook for example says takebacks are ok until dice are rolled for example.

So in dominant species if I wanderlust and place the tile and food then replace it to be adjacent to more tiles and get extra points, is that allowed?

"I know, I know, I know. You've seen this title a few times too many. But I am at wit's end and need advice.

I have a history of being unlucky in board and video games. Tonight, I was playing Settlers of Catan with the fam. I was not on the best spaces, but I was on some decent ones nonetheless. I was on a 9, which with 5 is the second-best spot in the game. I was on spots on the two next tiers, 10 and 4, 3 and 11. 

For people who don't know, this spot ranking is based on the probability of the roll of 2 die.

Here comes the unlucky bit, in the entire 2-hour game, a 9 was only rolled 2 times, 11 rolled once, 4 rolled twice, 3 rolled no times. I am a data analyst and statistician, I understand there might be bias, but this seems like a statistical improbability.

This isn't even a fluke, as soon as a game relies on luck instead of skill, I am guaranteed (I feel) to lose.

I saw that it wasn't on BGG, and thought I'd 'contribute' it, but clearly this is for people more well-versed in games than I am. It's a kids game so it's nothing as heavy as these categories are set up for, but I think it's a cute, quick little packable game. 

My MIL got it in europe from a store ""Flying Tiger Copenhagen"" and it seems *possible* that this is a clone of some other/existing game, re-skinned. 

Here's a [link to the game](https://flyingtiger.com/products/capture-the-creature-game-3042379) 

With a deck of 20 cards (even numbers blue, odd numbers red) you arrange six in a circle and roll two dice. One directs you to reference the largest or smallest even/odd/or overall card, the second tells you whether to select that card, the one one or two positions clockwise from it, or one or two positions counterclockwise from it. The fastest hand nabs it, you play until there are only two cards left, most cards wins. It's ""creature hunter"" themed with cute art and reasonably quality components. 

I don't know a name for that mechanism. The ""Categories"" seem kind of non-parallel and overlapping... the specific credits are entirely unknown to me.

"I made this for my copy of DS out of 6mm craft foam from Michael's (99 cents per 9""x12"" sheet), glued together with some glue called ""Shoe Goo,"" which smells like model glue and acts like super rubber cement.

Something someone could whip up with a little patience and very few dollars at the craft store.

The glue joints look a little fubar, but it was my first time doing anything like this, and even though the joints don't look that solid, I don't think I could rip any of the joins apart without tearing the foam.

Note that this is NOT Foamcore, this is a foam material that doesn't have any skin or coating; it is the same material all the way through.

I made three compartments to hold the tiles and the cards, and made a separate tray for each player that holds all their markers. These stack two high on the other side of the box with the element bag on one side, and are half the height of the tile section, so together, they make a platform for the board on top.

"Hello

We were playing the card + board game called Sequence with the 4 players paired into 2 teams. Papa and I were paired up and Husband and my Mama were paired up. For context, about the game Sequence: When it is your turn to play, you play a card from your hand (of 6 cards) face-up into the centre, place your coin on the board corresponding to the card you played, and draw another card from the face-down pile. Then the next player does the same and so on. The aim is for your team to complete 2 sequences (of 5 cards/coins each) on the board first. Jacks are wild, so you can use Jacks (if you have them) to remove a card/coin played by your opponent or to place your coin anywhere on the board even if you don't have the corresponding card.

Now, we all learnt to play with the rule that if you forget to draw a card on your turn, noone is gonna remind you, and if the next player has made their play, then you can't draw a card because that's too late. I'm not sure if this is part of the Sequence rules, but in general whenever I've played card/board games (such as remembering to take your 200$ when you pass Go in Monopoly), the rule has been if you don't do things in your turn, noone should remind you. 

My game partner Papa missed drawing a card so i reminded him, but my opponent Husband was not happy because i flouted the above rule of no reminders. Next time, same round Papa forgot to draw his card again and i did not remind him, and he had to play the rest of the game with a 5 cards hand while the rest of us played with 6 cards in hand. We still managed to win the round.

In the next round, my Papa missed taking a card and I did not remind him, and then my Husband missed too again no reminder. Both me and my Mama said cool now the teams are even since both teams have a 5-cards player.


Afterwards, my Husband got into a discussion with me (privately) that when my Papa missed drawing a card, he changed fortunes of everyone in the game. So i said sure but also he played with 5 cards instead of 6 giving him less choice in every subsequent lay. My husband said that the card that was intended for my teammate ended up being drawn by my opponent instead, and the luck changed by -1 card for each person around the table. Hence it is unfair when some player(s) is not alert and doesn't follow the rules and impacts the outcome of the game. I disagreed - this sounds more superstitious than logical, since Sequence is a game not entirely based on luck, but also on skill - you can keep track of what cards have gone from game play, or determine which cards are more probable to benefit your opponent, or strategically block your opponent by playing the Jack. Husband explained mathematically to me how probability is impacted when a player skips drawing a card, and i said yes but the game is not like a Highest-card-wins where every player is vying for the same card, here different players need different cards to help win. Husband said I'm defensive because it's my Papa who kept forgetting repeatedly (he forgot at least once in every single round we played) and that I'm not understanding logic because of how defensive i am.

I've googled but not found a satisfactory link - does anyone know what is the mathematically, factually correct way of looking at this?

"We had a 3-player group that had my daughter and her super-strategic boyfriend (avid boardgamer, that is) for New Year's. The plan was to play a couple of rounds of Spirit Island, but there was a twist. We first turned the board to the more intricate side up, then selected a scenario and spirits that seemed to fit. So we played a Germany scenario first with varied spirits. I had the one that generated a lot of fear, and we won by fear level II eradicating all but the explorers.

I was about done for but the year hadn't turned yet, so next up was Sweden. Fortunately there was a win condition where the mushrooms had to outnumber the houses so by moving the dahan and explorers &amp; buildings we managed to win. We just had too defensive and slow spirits to kill them outright.

This was my first time playing the scenarios and I think it's been over a year since I played anyway so for an older guy, it was a bit hard putting it all together, I concentrated mostly on taking care of my side of the board while they plotted most of the gather/push actions. For advanced players, I think it really adds to the base game, as the beginning phase can be quite uneventful.

"2022 was a big year in board gaming for my boyfriend and I. We started board gaming in 2021 and really picked up the pace. We pretty much play exclusively 2-player, with a couple of exceptions on BGA. I saw another post listing games from a 2-player perspective, and thought it would be fun to offer up some more of that. My boyfriend’s ratings will be in parentheses, but only my opinions will be written out, unless our scores vary wildly.

**7 Wonders Architect**— 5/10, (7/10). It was fine. It was fun at first, but quickly got stale after a few plays because of some strategies. We found that building as quickly as possible was the best way to win.  I didn’t find that am engaging way to play and preferred to build up science tokens. Am I a sore loser? I don’t know. The game just lost its spark for me.

**7 Wonders Duel** — 7/10, (8/10). Definitely better than Architects. I lose this one to my boyfriend more often than not, so perhaps I’m not a sore loser. But I enjoy this one more because the gameplay is tighter and offers more possibilities.

**Alma Mater**— 9/10, (4/10). Unpopular opinion: I love this one. It’s got a looot going on, and every choice is tight and meaningful. It’s a huge puzzle and so many decisions. Now, I can easily get decision fatigue, but I never get it with this one. Interestingly, my boyfriend hates it for the same reason I love it, haha. Super fun!

**Architects of the West Kingdom**— Left unrated. We’ve only played this once, so I want to give it more tries before firmly rating it. But I love the amount of choices you have and how you kind of shape your fate.

**Azul**— 7/10, (8.5/10). Very fun and engaging. A real thinker. Not much else to say, everything that can be said about it has practically been said on this subreddit, so I won’t repeat.

**Brew**— 8/10, (5/10). I don’t like luck very much, but Brew takes dice chucking and makes it deeper. Dice drafting is fun here and options are simple, yet diverse. Cute art and theme, and you have to be adaptable. Boyfriend doesn’t like the theme and the game just doesn’t make him excited to play it.

**Caper: Europe**— 9/10, (7.5/10). This is a really great drafting game we picked up on a whim one day. The art is adorable, the theme is fun, and the mechanics are simple yet allow for some deep thinking. It’s also very fun to hoard all of the coins to stop your opponent from getting anything good.

**Coimbra**— 7/10, (7/10). I don’t think it’s as fun as Alma Mater, but my boyfriend likes it more. That said, we both recognize that the main strategy is just “take the purple track as often as possible”, and we haven’t picked it up since. I hope to play it more, but knowing the one optimal strategy does kinda kill the vibe. Either way, the dice drafting is still super fun here (thanks for opening my eyes, Brew) and meaningful.

**Dice Forge**— 7/10, (7.5/10). I think it’s fun, we just don’t get it to the table often. More dice throwing, but you can manipulate your dice so that luck is always on your side. We always extend the game to 15 rounds. Playing only 10 rounds feels too short. It kind of also suffers from “optimal strategy syndrome”— make sure you get your board extension and get a gold-to-points card, but it suffers from that less than Coimbra and 7WArchitects do.

**Evolution**— 7/10, (8/10). Love the engine building here. It’s a bit mean, but, hey, survival of the fittest. I do like the strategy and creativity involved in making your species. Sometimes you have to make tough decisions when carnivores come into play, but I like that.

**Fantastic Factories**— 6.5/10, (6/10). Fun, but there are other games we just like more. Nothing really unique about this dice draft/manipulation game. Fun theme, though, and something nice and light when we’re not in a thinky mood.

**Flamecraft**— 6.5/10, (5/10). Another very-talked-about game here. I pretty much agree with the consensus. It’s cute, light, and has some nice strategy to it, but compared to other games, it’s a bit forgettable. That said, I definitely want to play it more. That theme draws me in so much.

**Ghosted**— 5.5/10, (5.5/10). This game is fun and I enjoy deduction and logic puzzles. But, The Search For Planet X does this game better. I don’t think I want to get rid of it, and I think we would play this when we don’t feel like Planet X or Mind MGMT but still want a deduction game. It has its place, and it’s by no means a bad game. It just kind of pales in comparison to Planet X and Mind MGMT.

**Hadrian’s Wall**— 9/10, (10/10). There’s way more going on here than in Alma Mater, but my boyfriend likes it more, interestingly enough. This is a popular game here, and we all know why, so I won’t bore you. Lots to do, very thinky. Brain happy.

**Honey Buzz**— 8/10, (4/10). I like the theme. But, this is another “optimal strategy syndrome” patient. I can’t help myself, though; it hasn’t gotten stale for me yet! It’s just so damn charming. The movement, tile placement, resource management etc. just kind of culminate in a good experience. It has a few different mechanisms but they all feel like they have a reason to be there. My boyfriend hates this for the same reasons I love it.

**Jaipur**— 9/10, (9/10). Fantastic game. Not much else to be said, you’ve all said it for me. 

**Mind MGMT**— Left unrated. We literally just got this this week for the B&amp;N sale. We’ve only played one training session, so it wouldn’t be fair to rate it. I was the recruiter, and I feel like the rogue agents have a lot more fun. But, of course, we’re gonna play some more.

**Parks**— 5/10, (4/10). Just kinda “meh” when compared to other games. Enjoyable in the moment, but kind of forgettable after.

**Patchwork**— 5/10, (5/10). Azul, but kinda worse. Also, Tetris, but kinda worse.

**Planted**— 8/10, (5/10). Love the theme, and the combination of drafting and resource management make this game stand out a bit. This would be a great gateway game. Boyfriend thinks it’s just mediocre.

**Res Arcana**— Left unrated. We’ve played it once and the play through was a bit forgettable (hence why it’s left unrated— can’t really remember much of it), though I do remember enjoying the time playing it. I wanna play it more, other games just grab our attention first.

**Root**— 10/10, (10/10). Another unpopular opinion: Holy moly Root is fun as hell at two. We haven’t even played with Hirelings or the Marauder expansion, though we do have those. We’re missing out on the politics and diplomacy that make this game lovable, but I enjoy just the pure gameplay. The tough decisions, playing around your opponent, all of it. Can’t wait to play this more.

**Splendor**— 6/10, (6.5). Enjoyable, but I’d rather play other games. It’s fun and a nice engine builder, but ultimately I’d probably pick something else to play. We’ll probably only play this on BGA.

**Summer Camp**— 6/10, (6/10). It’s nice and enjoyable, but we have other games we like more. I enjoy the deck building and the theme is pretty different from our other games. This would also be a great gateway game.

**Tapestry**— 5/10, (N/A). I thought it was fun at first, but quickly got stale.

**That Time You Killed Me**— 10/10, (7/10). This is an amazing game. Very controlled, you have to think a few steps ahead, and the expansions make choices more dynamic. I absolutely love it. Perfect 2-player-exclusive game, and one of my favorites of the year. My boyfriend says he likes it but it just makes him want to play chess.

**The Search for Planet X**— 8.5/10, (8/10). The better Ghosted. The game is popular for a good reason, so we’ll just acknowledge that it’s great and move on.

**Trails**— 5/10, (4/10). Kind of the same deal with Parks.

**Viticulture**— 8/10, (4/10). I like the different strategies and how you have have to think ahead. My boyfriend thinks it overstays it’s welcome.

**Welcome To**— 9/10, (10/10). Great decision-making, great gameplay. Simple, but deep. A variety of strategies (although one is clearly better than others).

**Wingspan**— 7/10, (8.5/10). I like Everdell better. It’s fun, but I don’t want to play it a whole lot. I’m very engaged when I do play, and I enjoy it, but it doesn’t give me reasons to pick this game up over others. I know I’ll play it more next year, but I don’t know how often.

"Lists, everyone’s doing them so why not me too? I’ve taken elements of other lists. That I liked so it’s kinda like three separate lists. Enough rambling let’s get into it.

Most played games of 2022:

1. **Werewords** - 9 plays. I don’t remember playing this that many times but it seems that I did. I mean rounds play in 5 mins so it makes sense that I probably played it back to back to back. Werewords. It’s Werewolf meets 20 questions. I don’t normally care for either but combine them and you have a fun party game. Really excels I think at 8 and above so that might be a bummer for most. 7/10 

2. **Bloodborne** - 7 plays. If we’re talking most time played it’s this by a mile at 19 hrs. I went from being cold on this game to warm to getting cold again. It’s a big CMON KS. There’s no dice it’s all regulated by cards. Managing your weapon is neat but the game boils down to did you play fast and stagger or have room to dodge? No? You’re dead. Also we messed up the rules so many times cause the rule book ain’t the best but that’s more of an us thing too. 5/10

3. **Teotihuacan** - 7 plays. I wish this got played more. It wasn’t til the end that we played with everything from just late pre-classic. Want to use the expansion period expansion but seeing as this was on our 7x7 and we completed it we probably won’t be revisiting for a bit. Gameplay: it’s a rondel but a square. 9/10

4. **Detective Club** - 7 plays. Was also on the 7x7. I don’t think I will be putting another party game on challenge. I went from loving this game to cooling just a bit. I still think it’s fun and probably the most anxiety friendly social deduction game. 7/10. 

5. **Cosmic Frog** - 6 plays. It’s big frogs in space slugging on each other and vomiting up planets. 8/10.


Now lets take a look at new to me games with my Top New to Me Games of 2022:

1. **Kingdom Death: Monster** - 2 plays. I finally got to play KDM and I punched a lion’s testicles off. It then proceeded to murder me but it was worth it. I really liked KDM and it really made me back Aeon Trespass: Odyssey. 

2. **PitchCar** - 2 plays. I like flicking games. This is racing Crokinole so what’s not to love. The only thing that might elevate it in my eyes is if the pieces could jump like the penguins in ice cool. Think about it Eagle Gryphon.

3. **A Feast For Odin** - 1 play. I was wary going into AFFO but it did not disappoint. It’s a worker placement game with a personal player board where you’re slotting polyominals. Sold. 

4. **Aquatica** - 1 play. This games is unique. I mean it’s essentially a “combo builder?” You’re sliding these cards in your tableau further and further for effects and points. It’s good. 

5. **Great Western Trail** - 1 play. I struggled between Barrage, Taverns of Tifenthal but I’m gonna go with GWT. It’s deck building mixed with…worker movement? I know a rondel when I see one GWT. Anyway, I don’t know if I’ll love GWT as much as everyone else but it left an impression and that’s something. 

Thanks for taking the time to read my list and as a bonus happy new year send-off these are the five games in my collection I’m most excited to try in 2023:

1. Eclipse
2. Age of Steam
3. My Father’s Work
4. Endless Winter

"I hear **Carcassone** is a good board game, I haven't played it yet, and I don't know anybody who owns it. I've noticed there are a ton of expansions

I'm trying to decide if I should get it

"We almost always play games just the two of us, so perhaps this will be a helpful perspective one way or another:

**Fleet: The Dice Game**. Very fun roll &amp; write game with a bit of strategy when picking dice and deciding what to deprive your opponents of. I think it’s best in small doses as there are only so many angles to explore in terms of strategy, but we’ve been playing it somewhat regularly. 

**Onitama**. Kind of a simplified version of chess is maybe the best way to describe this one. I like it a lot and it can be a bit of a brain buster since whatever move you use, your opponent will be able to make shortly after. It’s actually not that similar to **Royal Visit** but they’re lumped in the same category at our house since they both have just a mat, some cards and a few pieces. Both are easy to jump into with almost zero setup time.

**Heir to the Pharaoh**. A strictly 2-player game that I learned and we’ve played once thus far. I wasn’t sure if either of us would like it or not, but the first game went fine and we’re likely to try it again. You bid on Egyptian gods that let you score points in different ways, including building a pyramid and monuments that you score based on how many other monuments they point to. One game should be all it takes for the other person to pick it up. Still deciding exactly how fun the game is, but it’s at least worth a look if you’re needing a new two player game.

**Jaws**. This one didn’t make it for us. We’re going to give it another go at some point but with two players I don’t know how well this games work where one person is doing something completely different than the other.

**Root** Before I catch hell for this one, I fully admit we should’ve done a little more research before purchasing. It was a bit confounding to learn upon the first read through of the rulebook, but regardless it just seems like the game is a million times better with 3-4 players. I still don’t foresee myself enjoying this game much despite its popularity, but I can’t say for sure since we’ve never played with optimal player count. Still, it says 2-4 players on the box so I do put some of the blame directly on the game.

**The Crew**. Another pretty popular one that didn’t land for us. This one has a manufactured “third player” for the purposes of playing with two people. We’ve also not played a lot of two player trick taking games so it’s possible it just might be a genre we don’t get along with well.

**Dominion**. We were 100% devoted to this deck builder for 5-6 months. I think we may have moved too fast though. We added the Seaside and Prosperity expansions and all was well. Then we added Intrigue and it burnt us out for some reason. Just didn’t like that set at all and we’ll probably just cut our losses and take it out from now on. Plus I bought the update packs for Seaside and Prosperity so there’s cards all over the place any time we want to play now (we still enjoy a lot of the cards they replaced). 

I think the game is awesome and I love the cards available changing each game. Something happened after we bought Intrigue though and we can’t quite put our finger on it. I can’t figure out if we need to buy more cards or just play with the three sets we like, or if we just need an extended break from the game.

**Tags**. This is a great party game that also works great with just two people. You have 5 categories and 4 letters. You simply say a word that that starts with one of the letters and fits the category, and you take the points. So if the category is Furniture and the letter “E” is on the board, you could say ‘end table’ and the points are yours. To claim the points you also pick up these neat little ceramic balls the game comes with, which adds a little tactile stimulation that actually goes a long way towards the fun even if it is technically a bit of a gimmick. Again, a great party game and it fits a great niche for us when we want to play something light but still use a modicum of brain power.","Games we played in 2022, from the perspective of a 2-player household.",1,self.boardgames,1000c77,Broadnerd,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1000c77/games_we_played_in_2022_from_the_perspective_of_a/,1672511146

For me, I enjoyed it but doing think I’d do it again. There were too many days where I was playing a game just to check the box. But I still had a blast with it, and I played a lot more than I otherwise would have.

I ended with 584 plays this year, including an even 100 plays of **Onirim**. Ironically, I wouldn’t list that game amongst my favorites, it’s just so quick and mindless that it’s a good one to pull out while watching a show.

Some of my other most-played were **Sprawlopolis** (35), **No Thanks** (21), and **Marvel Champions** (20). I’d highly recommend all 3. In terms of time spent playing, I’d say **Gloomhaven** takes the crown. I only played 7 times, but 3-handed takes a while.

"After seeing the dozens of games I had collecting dust, this year was the year I set to play all of them, including any new pickups during the year.  Rather than go into detail of all of them, I'll touch upon a few highlights and lowlights.  The full list of games will be at the bottom of the post and I can talk about more of them in the comments if requested but for now here's the roses and thorns.

*Lived up to the hype:* **Ark Nova** was a blast to play and I made sure to sleeve it as soon as I could.  This game was everything I wanted it to be.  I really enjoy the action selection and the various maps.  This is easily in my top 3 now.

*Too many birdwatchers:* **Wingspan Asia**'s flock mode was terrible.  At that point we may have well just played two entirely separate games.  There are enough cards for it anyway.  As for the ""duet"" mode, I have to play it more to see if I prefer it to a regular game.  It's different but that isn't bad.  Also it's not really a ""duet,"" it's just two player.

*Lite version of a great game:* **Terraforming Mars: Ares Expedition** was a more streamlined version of a game I already love (but don't own).  I do enjoy fun action selection mechanics after all.  It's easier to explain and doesn't take nearly as long so I can see this hitting the table more often.  Also no, I haven't played Race for the Galaxy, why do you ask?

*Prehistoric Pandemic Pales in comParison:* **Paleo** wasn't that much fun for me.  I like a good co-op game but this wasn't it.  Luckily I was able to make a bgg trade for another game for it.  I think we had to have been playing it wrong.  It was either too easy or too hard.  There were never any tense moments like there can be in Eldritch Horror or even Pandemic.

*Root without the violence:* **Everdell** is the game I traded for Paleo and the first time I played it I did a terrible job and finished my last season before the other player got to the final season at all, also I was actively getting more and more covid by the minute.  Gave it a second try when I wasn't fighting for my life and it was great!  First tableu building game I've played and I really enjoyed trying to chain things together in an engine sort of way.  And those berries look too tasty.

*What do you mean I'm playing it wrong?* **FUSE** was taught to me improperly so when I bought it I didn't bother to read the rulebook.  Oops.  Turns out the correct way to play isn't as much fun as our incorrect, much harder, way.

*Roller Coaster Tycoon The Board Game:* **Tenpenny Parks** was a fun polyomino game that was a hit at game night.  I bought it on a whim because if Ark Nova was Zoo Tycoon, I needed to get Roller Coasters too.  Turned out to be a good buy.

*Inside you there are two wolves:* **The Alpha** is a simple game that really shouldn't be played with six players.  It took way longer than expected and for a game based almost entirely on dice rolls, it could be theoretically possible to outplay your opponents and get nothing for it the entire game if you roll a ""no food"" option.  It could've been a neat little game for 3 or 4, but we played with 6 and now no one wants to play it again because of how long it took for how simple it is.

*WE. DIG. GIANT ROBOTS!* **GKR Heavy Hitters** was something I heard of a few years ago and I finally managed to get my hands on a copy.  It's a miniature skirmish game with giant robots blowing each other up and demolishing buildings.  What's not to love?  Plus there's really something about seeing the exasperation on your opponents face when you manage to roll seven 6s and fully block their super weapon.

*Please take this off my hands:* **Expedition The Roleplaying Card Game** is... awful.  I bought it at a convention years ago because it came with an NES cartridge.  That alone sold it for me.  I can play a board game and a retro game?  Cool! *but it was not cool.*  Played it to complete the challenge of playing all the games and oh my is it bad.  It's a card based RPG system that also has a single d20 to decide everything.  And it has a timer to determine how much damage you take.  This is the worst game in my collection.  I will not be doing the same thing next year.  Some games just aren't worth playing again.

"I introduced my friends to Avalon earlier this year, and we have played it at least once a week since. We love the base game, and have committed some truly *inspired* gaslighting of each other.
However, we've played it a lot. Like a LOT a lot.
I didn't know about the big box expansion, and to my eternal shame I even managed to miss the optional extra rules at the back of the rulebook. So, knowing only the base game rules, we came up with our own expansion: Chaos Mode. It is truly delightful, so in case anyone else wants a go, here are the rules:

1) Shuffle *all* 14 character cards together.

2) Deal two cards to every player (there are only 7 of us, so we've never had a problem of running out of cards, but if there are more of you, deal out to half the people, shuffle the discarded ones together, and deal to the rest)

3) The following rules are very important, you need to stick to them:

   i) If you are given Merlin, you must choose Merlin
   ii) If you are given the Assassin, you must choose the Assassin
   iii) If you are given both, you must declare it and redeal to everyone. These rules do not mean that the Assassin and Merlin will appear in every game if there are less than 7 of you, but it does make it more likely.

4) Play the game as normal (when I discovered the optional extra rules, we played one round of chaos mode with both the lady of the lake card and choosing which quests to go on, and it worked well, so I think you can add these rules in without affecting the Chaos)

5) At the end of the game, call for the Assassin to reveal themselves and say who they think Merlin is. If there is no Assassin, Morgana may choose. If there is no Morgana, Unnamed Servant of Mordred may choose. (Mordred and Oberon never get the chance to choose, as Mordred has an advantage in that Merlin doesn't know them, and Oberon has the disadvantage of not knowing the other evil players.) The player accusing Merlin may also win by correctly guessing there is no Merlin in the game.

"I've been attempting to complete a 10x10 (or similar) challenge every year since 2020, and have continuously failed due to various factors. 2019 was the most recent year I've technically completed one, although I hadn't set the goal at that time.

For anyone unfamiliar with the 10x10 challenge, it simply is a challenge to play 10 games 10 times each between January 1st and December 31st of a given year. The idea is to not only encourage you to play games, but to play the same game several times to both combat the ""cult of the new"" phenomenon as well as really discover the various things any particular game has to offer, which often doesn't become apparent for several plays.

For 2023, I believe I will be able to achieve this goal, partially because of my modified challenge solution! I have split my 10x10 into two challenges, totaling 100 plays like a single 10x10 would: a 10x4 with some of our most-played games that we want to continue exploring, and a 12x5 that allows us to play a little more variety. 

The plays in this challenge will only be counted with plays including at least the two of us who created this challenge and are our main group. The four 10-plays were picked together, 7 of the 12 were picked randomly using the Board Record app, weighted so that games we've played less often were more likely to be picked, 1 campaign game was picked together, and finally we each picked 2 games individually that we would like added. I'll provide a rating for each game as well.

Our 4x10 picks:

**Marvel Champions**: we have 69 plays of this game together since 2020 and have no intention to stop. We love the combos and being able to pair our heroes together to overcome difficult scenarios. 10/10

**Unmatched**: we started this at about the same time as Champions and so far have 62 plays since 2020. The 1v1 and asymmetry of this game keeps us constantly coming back for more and looking forward to new heroes. Our favorite way to play has been to set up tournament brackets where we pit all characters against one another. My friend owns all content except for the Buffy set, so these tournaments are getting increasingly difficult to complete. 9/10

**Dominion**: this is the game that really brought us into the hobby. We have every expansion and love playing this one to this day. I didn't start tracking plays until 2019, but I can guarantee it's our most-played game together. The variety in the game is something that just never gets old to us, although it has been seeing decreasingly fewer plays each year. 10/10

**Dice Throne**: Our most recent 1v1 discovery that we've found we enjoy. It's similar to Unmatched in the sense that you have two fighters going head-to-head, but very different gameplay. I first played this years ago when I played a friend's copy after the first Kickstarter released, but I wasn't a huge fan because it felt too luck-driven. I decided on a whim to back the Marvel Dice Throne set, and have since learned that the game has far more strategical depth than it may appear for a dice chucker. The cardplay and the ""combat points"" currency are a huge thing to consider. Managing these and playing your character properly, including knowing when to push your luck, is key to winning, and I have actually found that the better player is often the one that wins. I have since bought all content and look forward to exploring those characters. 8/10

Our seven random picks for the 12x5:

**Dice Forge**: I already have 7 plays logged of this, but only one with the expansion. Really cool gimmick of being able to customize your dice throughout the game, and the fact that there's no real downtime is great. Look forward to exploring the expansions more in 2023. 7/10

**Explorers of the North Sea**: I played this game a lot with my parents when I got it in 2019, but have barely played it since (8 plays in 2019, 11 plays total). My friend has only played this once, so I'm looking forward to rediscovering this one with him and the expansion. Great game...a little on the lighter side for what I lean towards now, but if I'm going for a tile-laying or pick up and deliver game, this would be my pick. 7/10.

**Fall of the Mountain King**: Recently acquired from Kickstarter, and played once the week I got it. I had high hopes but was ultimately left a little disappointed. It was fun, but it seemed a little clunky and probably could have used some streamlining. Hopefully five more plays well help solidify the rules and I'll be able to appreciate it more. The best part of the game was the action selection mechanism. Feel kinda bad rating it after a single play, but first impression leads me with probably 5/10.

**Love Letter**: Great, classic microgame. We played this game a ton pre-2019, but it got weighted heavier in the randomizer since I didn't start logging plays until that year and we've only played twice since then. I'm not opposed to a classic microgame on this list, but it doesn't particularly excite me either. Oh well, I do always end up having a good time with this one. 8/10

**Mystic Vale**: a pretty fun card crafter. It's my friend's game, but I've only played twice since 2019, and he's gotten a ton of expansion content since then. I can't say I've ever been a huge fan because I usually can scratch the same itch with a classic deckbuilder, but I am looking forward to exploring this one and the new content more, because even if I count my handful of plays pre-2019, I know I've just scratched the surface. 6/10

**Raiders of the North Sea**: I absolutely love this game. It's really the game that got me into worker placement and euro games in general. I played a ton pre-2019, and have played 19 times since then. My friend, however, has only played 5 times, which explains how it was drawn from the randomizer. At this point I think it has been outranked by 2-3 other Garphill games, but the expansions for this one are phenomenal and I'll gladly come back to it any time. 10/10

**Star Wars: Rebellion**: We dipped our toes in this exactly one time in May 2022 and had a great time. This will probably be the most difficult game on the list to complete just because of the time commitment. I have the expansion, but we didn't play with it yet. Maybe after two or three more plays we'll be ready to add it. Again, I feel bad rating on a single play, but right now I'd go with a solid 7/10.

Our campaign pick for 5 plays:

**Gloomhaven**: I've personally beaten this one and finished most of the side content with a separate group back in 2018. My friend hasn't, and he and I have been very slowly chipping away at it in a separate campaign, but we've only played 6 times since 2019. I absolutely love the theme and cardplay in this game. It's a beast to get into and get set up, but I don't think there's an experience quite like it. Looking forward to getting this one out a little more frequently this year. 10/10

My friend's two picks:

**Core Worlds**: Eh, it's fine. It's actually quite a good deckbuilder, and it's definitely one of the heaviest in the genre. My problem is that it's too long for what it delivers. Usually by about 2/3 of the way through, I'm ready to be done. I have seven plays so far, so I kinda doubt my opinion will change much at this point, but we'll see. The Galactic Orders expansion is near-mandatory for me at this point because the expansion really is a good one, although it doesn't ""fix"" any issues I have with the base game. It's currently my lowest rated game on our challenge with a 4/10.

**The Witcher: The Old World**: nothing to say here since it's being delivered from Kickstarter this year and I know nothing about it. I love the Witcher 2 and 3 video games and have been entertained by the Netflix series, so the theme interests me but I know next to nothing about the gameplay.

My two picks:

**Wingspan**: It's a good engine builder that I somehow managed to not play or get until early 2022. I don't think I enjoy it as much as most people seem to, but I still have a good enough time with it. So far I've only played the base game and have a total of 5 plays, two of which are solo. I have all the expansions now, and will probably begin adding those after another play or two. I simply want to explore this one more even though I know it's far from my favorite. 7/10

**Wayfarers of the South Tigris**: I'm looking forward to playing this one more than any other game in the challenge. I got it from Kickstarter in November, and played it solo 3 times. I'm generally a big fan of Garphill games, and honestly my first impressions are that this could be my favorite yet. It feels like playing an open world board game with how much decision space there is here. It didn't really look like something I'd enjoy very much, but I decided to back it anyway due to Garphill's track record, and I'm sure glad that I did. I'm looking forward to seeing how it holds up in multiplayer, but based on my solo experience, I have to give this a 10/10.

Lastly, our reserve pick in case Witcher doesn't deliver in time or we can't get around to five games of Rebellion:

**Marvel United**: I went all-in for both seasons of content during the X-Men campaign. We've played this game a lot, and there's a ton more to explore, but it's a pretty quick game so it will probably end up getting played a little by us anyway... Otherwise I'll be playing it separately with family. Still, it seemed like a reasonable reserve choice and we both love this game too and it can be completed quickly should the need arise. 10/10

So there it is! I'd love to read your thoughts on our modified challenge, as well as our picks (or even our method of picking). Do you have a challenge set for 2023? If so, what is it and what's on the list?

"My favourite social deduction game is Don’t Mess with Cthulhu, also published under the name Timebomb and Tempel des Schreckens. (In case you haven’t played: each player is dealt a secret role, either investigator or cultist. You get some facedown cards which you can look at and describe but not show others. Then players get to flip each other’s cards one by one. The investigators are trying to reveal enough ”Elder Sign” cards to win while the cultists win instantly if one particular card - the Great Cthulhu - is flipped.)

The rules are super simple - yet a lot of debate and double-dealing can go into what cards get revealed. Also, unlike in many similar games, even the good guys need to bluff to win. It’s just so elegant and tense: I love it. Many people to whom I have introduced it have really liked it, too.

However, I’ve also had some players bounce off the game HARD. I think it has to do with DMwC being an almost pure mind game: if you go in wanting to solve a logic problem, you don’t necessarily have much to work with. Neither are there dice to roll, resources to manage or quests to perform, just the words you say and how you say them.

There are so many social deduction games with varying rules complexity these days. Have you found other such games to be similarly polarising?

"I told you guys that I had 100 copy’s of a printed board game ready to go, and I was sitting wondering what the next step was. 

Obviously, you guys told me nobody would ever spend money on an un playtested thing etc etc.

That got me to take an extremely hard look at what I was doing in the first place. It had already been two years in development, and I took it back to the paper and pencil start. 

I discovered two things it was missing. It is so much more fun, and I got excited and completely redid the entire graphic design for every asset in the game.

I anticipate in the next six months, I will have 10 copies printed to give to playtesters for Free. I will include a form to fill out, and your name will be included on the finished product.

It is a randomized dungeon board game intended to bridge a gap. It is for parents who like fantasy gaming, who want a way to introduce young kids to the concept (like 5 and up).

My experience with my kid is that there wasn’t really a board game or physical thing to do that really filled this void. It was all so complicated for my kid that they just wouldn’t understand.

"Games new to me in 2022:

**5 Minute Marvel -** Flip over cards with Marvel characters until you win or 5 minutes have elapsed. At least there is truth in advertising!

**Air, Land, and Sea -** Head to head WWII card game. Control 2 of the three theaters to win a round; win by enough points to win the game. A functional game. 

**Ark Nova -** THE HYPE IS REAL. In fairness, me falling in love with a game about ZOOS shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone, but this one is all that and a bag of animal feed.

**Batman: The Dark Knight Returns -** Fun solo game that I used to ring in the first day of my first vacation in literal years. Production quality is off the chart and rules, once you wrap your head around them, move well enough. I'm still not entirely sure that my victory was correct, but close enough that I'm not gonna put an asterisk by it. (HINT: If you follow the story more closely, the game is much easier.)

**Blaze -** A not uninteresting but not super innovative take on trick taking with gorgeous foil cards. Come for the foil, stay for the...er, foil.

**Cascadia -** Pretty and relaxing. I've got nothing bad to say about it. Just didn't super engage me.

**Dicevania -** Impulse buy dollar kickstarter. Certainly worth what I paid.

**Disney's Sorcerer's Arena: Epic Alliances -** It's basically a simplified version of Star Wars Epic Duels, which wasn't THAT complex of a game to start with. There is a place for this game but I would always rather play Epic Duels, and likely Unmatched if I ever get around to trying that.

**Dreadful Circus -** An auction, set collection game. It's fine.

**Dinosauria -** A small print and play dinosaur game with gorgeous art. Sadly the art was the most interesting thing about the game. As a solo affair, the automa literally just gets points every round, so the strategy is not to end the game until you've got more; as a mutliplayer affair it's not much better. It's ostensibly a resource management game but those resources come to you so randomly that there's never not an obvious choice. Ah well.

**Dungeon Petz -** Interesting little worker placement game with a unique theme but not terribly unique gameplay. By no means bad, but I can't help but notice that no one's really going back to it.

**Flamecraft -** All in on the Kickstarter and not disappointed. This is a next steps game that won't melt your brain, but there's depth and decisions aplenty, and for as few moving pieces as it has, it's surprisingly tactical.

**Food Chain Island -** A less engaging ButtonShy than I'd hope for. I don't regret the all-in pledge but given how insanely beloved this one is, I was expecting more.

**Gate -** Obtained along with Tin Helm. Don't regret it, but Tin Helm steals it's thunder in a huge way.

**Great Western Trail -** This one took me about a play and a half to wrap my head around. Aside from not really understanding mechanically how a cowboy would improve their heard by driving it across the prairie...the puzzle of this game is interesting, and the strategies emergent. This is one that deserves a few more plays.

**Iron Helm -** An interesting and incredibly modular solo game that gets a huge amount of play out of, essentially, a 20 card deck. I went whole hog on a crowdsale and got every blessed bit of it, which may have been overkill, but it's definitely going to hit the table more than once.

**Jumbo Grand Prix -** Knitzia being Knitzia. As is typical of his earlier designs it's a numerical puzzle with a pasted on theme. Meh.

**Jurassic World: Legacy of Isla Nublar -** As much as I love the theme, this one is a bit odd. You have so few actions in a given game that it becomes more of an efficiency puzzle than a game. Yet somehow my cohort and I have yet to lose a session at 5 games in. I guess we're just that good? Or, to an extent, that lucky.

**Legendary: A James Bond Deckbuilding Game -** Interesting fusion of the more basic Legendary engine with aspects of the Legendary Encounters engine. Gives me interesting ideas for things to do with the Star Wars set I'm always tinkering with!

**Libertailia -** I see why it's so highly regarded. I don't think it's really for me.

**NEOM -** A drafting, city-building game. I think this is going for a similar audience as It's A Wonderful World, and I think I appreciate it a bit more, but I need to get a couple more plays in to really make that call.

**New York Zoo -** Basically a Tetris game with an added element of filling zoo exhibits to get more Tetris pieces. A pretty puzzle, but there's some actual decisions to be made. Certainly worth getting on sale with credit!

**Nidavellir -** There's only so much you can do with a set collection game. This one adds probably the most tactical auction mechanism I've ever seen in a game, which makes it that much more engaging. It's among the better fillers I've seen, but I wouldn't devote a night to it.

**One Night Ultimate Werewolf -** I mean...it's fine? If you must play a large player count game you could do worse. It's one I'm unlikely to ask for but it's probably the best version of what it is - what it is, is just not something I'm hugely into.

**Radlands -** An impressively tight dueling game. Tableau placement matters hugely; this game is incredibly tactical, and unlike most dueling games you can't just exclusively focus on your own stuff and ignore your opponent except when they demand an answer. The nature of my play group will make it hard to get this one to the table but it's well worth it.

**Raptor -** An asymmetric head to head game that is basically an abstract, but the most thematic abstract I've ever seen. A unique card placement system means you're never entirely sure what the card you're playing will actually do - you can make an educated guess, but you sometimes have to deal with a surprise.

**Small World of Warcraft -** This is basically a distillation of the best of all the various expansions of Small World into a single package.  I dumped a massive amount of Small World stuff before moving because it wasn't hitting the table, but found that I missed it. Even without really caring about the license, this manages to hit the right notes without being the massive undertaking that a fully expanded Small World is, without the epic setup and tear down. Apparently if you know the license it's even funnier.

**So, You've Been Eaten -** An asymmetric strategic puzzle that I wanted to like more than I actually did like. It's by no means bad, but this is one where there isn't much margin for the two players having different skill levels, which makes it challenging to hit the table without a dedicated partner.

**Super-Skill Pinball -** All three editions, and I laminated the free Christmas board. I am not usually a fan of score-chasers, but this plays quick enough to not wear out it's welcome, is more engaging than other roll n writes, and captures the mechanics of pinball better than a board game should.

**Tapestry -** Interesting civ builder. Does more than a few things differently from other entries in the genre, but I feel that you really have to know the various civs in order to be competitive - ALL the civs in play in a given game, not just the one you happen to be playing. The level of investment necessary to get good at this one is real.

**Tin Helm -** If I wasn't exclusively work from home this would basically live in my pocket for lunch breaks. It's an incredible distillation of the Iron Helm system, and what it lacks in variety over its big brother it more than makes up for in portability.

**Twilight Inscription -** Yes, Virginia, it IS possible to turn the mother of all 4x games into a roll n write. That said, this game hits an interesting spot of not having complex mechanisms but definitely having complex interactions, and while the player count doesn't inherently change the playtime, and while it's certainly SHORTER than it's namesake, it's by no means a light or quick affair. Fantastic solo tho.

**Ugly Gryphen Inn -** Not my favorite ButtonShy, but more engaging than I expected. I can see this getting pulled out again in the future.

**Unsurmountable -** Likely the best of the ButtonShy games from the bundle I kickstarted, and yet somehow it hasn't hit the table more than once upon arrival.

"Hi Everyone,  


I'm thinking of ordering Everdell and I've been reading through various threads trying to work out if it's actually a good game or not but people seem either absolutely love it or hate it and it's hard to gauge.  


I don't really know the term what what type of board games I like because I've only recently felt the urge to get into them again. When i was little we used to play card and board games a lot so i do have some experience.  Games i used to love playing are UNO, Skip Bo, Rummy, Poker etc (and Happy Families when i was very little lol) We also used to play games like Chess, Draughts, Backgammon and family board games like Monopoly, cluedo, Trivial pursuits etc. I never liked Monopoly as i would get very bored very quickly, even now I don't have much patience for it. Maybe because my husband is ruthless at it and i get annoyed!  


I do play some video games. I have the Switch with Animal Crossing, Stardew Valley etc and I recently Downloaded the digital version or Root which I absolutely love but my husband finds way too complicated and I think my family will too.  


I am drawn to Everdell a) for the art work (Forest animals are right up my street)  b) because of the card aspect. and c) it seems simple enough to pick up if we have some experience with card games. d) it looks like it has good replayability  


Given the information above do you think it would be a good fit or does it get very repetitive and boring very quickly?   


I've watched some videos and it does look like fun but I thought I'd ask for opinions from people who have it and have played it a few times.

Watching the USPS tracking, I see that the card has been shipped to f’ing Guam, in the Western Pacific.  I’m in Oregon, the card was shipped from St. Louis.  Probably a USPS mistake.

8 or 9 days later I finally get it.  Stonemaier shipped the card in a thin bubble wrap with no rigid backing such as cardboard, and sure enough the package was bent and the card has a very noticeable permanent crease, so not usable for play.  Dumb dumb dumb.

I wrote back to Stonemaier explaining all this and that I’m going to return the game to FLGS.  They write back saying they would have sent another one.

"On Phase 8 it states: 7 cards of one color.

Traditionally you can ""HIT"" to match the cards for the Phase, so for this instance would be any color chosen for the Phase.

However, regardless of Phase, 'hits' play off of the numbers in the sets or runs.

In this specific instance on Phase 8, a Player had a 7 color run of 1-7, 10, and 12 which were all Red.

I hit against their run on my turn with a blue 8 to go off the 7, and am denied the hit.  Is this accurate based on not being a red card for the Phase,  or should I be able to hit because of the numbered run regardless of color?

Phase 8 is the ONLY Phase that cares about a color, and you can hit this same way on any other Phase, so it logically makes sense that I should be able to play my blue 8.

I’ve heard it was different enough and I’m a sucker for shorter games that we can fit in after the kids go to bed but today was just me and my oldest so I thought why not. I did give her a little guidance on things that weren’t obvious to her (like if a card was available to buy but she didn’t realize she had enough resources) and I didn’t hate draft. I was only a turn away from winning when she realized she had enough resources to seal her victory. Be warned playing this game with a 7 year old requires a lot of patience lol.

"Hi boardgamers,

Our small group has been working laboriously over the past 11 months to turn what started as a joke into a fully fledged boardgame &amp; wargame. I posted a few pictures a couple of weeks ago to announce our campaign draft on Gamefound so I thought I'd share a bit more, including a few pages from the rulebook and give a bit of a rundown on how the game works and plays.

Like most wargames, players start by designing their train and recruiting their crew (list building as some would say). 6 engines types, 8 different carriages, 18 weapons and 24 pieces of equipment mean you can tailor your train to suit your playstyle. Heavily armed and armoured land dreadnought? Light, fast and hard hitting? Minimal combat with plenty of room for freight or passengers? Or some blend of all the above? The choice is yours. On top of that, the 6 unique playable factions offer their own pros and cons, adding another layer of strategic nuance. Do you play as the steadfast and stoic Scions of Althann with their improved armour? The tricksy and whimsical Royaume Remnants? Every faction offers a different way to approach your path to victory. As a final layer to the list building, your crew are the resource for performing actions during the game. Do you buy maximum cheap Railhands (generic untrained workers) or pay extra for the Specialist, each one having been trained and experienced in one action? Specialists come in 10 different variants and you can recruit in any combination of Railhands and Specialists to suit your strategy.

In game, trains are represented from an external perspective with the use of models (which our sculptor is fastidiously working away at and they are amazing!) that run on Rail cards, meaning no two games will have the same tracks. Internally, your trains are represented by carriage cards which form a representation of your train model for you to keep track of crew placement, fuel, cargo and passengers (and prisoners if you've managed to kidnap any).

Game play involves 3 phases; Locomotion, Action and Recovery. Locomotion involves managing your train's speed, one of the most important aspects of running through the rail wilderness; your speed indicates how many actions you can take in the Action phase and fastest train gets turn priority in the Action phase. But go too fast and you risk derailing (the second worst thing that can happen to your train) or too slow and you risk having your train devoured by the living railgrowth (the worst thing). The Action phase sees players alternate moving their train and performing a single action. Serve passengers to gain tickets, cool your engines, repair damage, fire your weapons at opponents or even leap fearlessly to enemy trains to assault, loot or even hijack are just a few of the actions available. Alternating activation and reactive actions keep all players constantly engaged meaning there's no downtime between turns or waiting for your chance to play. Act strategically, utilising the advantages of your train build and crew strengths. The Recovery phase involves cleaning up unused Rail cards and readying your crew for the next round.

If this sounds like a game you'd be interested in, follow our draft page on Gamefound for some exciting updates in the next couple of days. Early access to the Rulebook is something we look forward to. Until then, I'd love to field any questions you may have and hear feedback; this is a community built project after all and our main goal is to give something back to the communities that nurtured our love of games.

"Looking for some rules/strategy help with The City of Kings. The scaling seems super off- we’ve encountered a very difficult creature very early in the run.

We started playing through the story mode of the City of Kings and finished the first two “stories”. Then near the beginning of story 3 we are tasked with collecting stone and building a castle for a steward. On our way to discover the tile, we flip over two creatures. The first one (level 5) seems hard but manageable, but the second (level 6) appears impossible to take down. It has 15 health, attacks for 5 damage at range 3, deals 3 damage every time it is attacked, and heals 2 damage every turn (also it curses, knock back 2, and inflicts poison). At this (early) point in the game, my character has 4 health, attacks for 2, and can heal for 3. I’ve upgraded my luck so there’s a chance I can deal extra 1-2 damage on an attack or heal 1-2 extra. My friend has a character at a similar level. Even if we threw everything we had at it, the characters would die in 1 hit if they don’t die to the reflect hits first. Because of the limited hope clock, there is no time to run around and farm experience and level up.

"Betrayal: Legacy: 6/10
-legacy elements were fun
-core mechanics still betrayal, which I do not love. Didn't finish it. 

Blitz Bowl: Ultimate Edition: 9/10
-unique to me to play sports in a board game. Very fun. Plays fairly quick. 30-45 min. 
-always comes down to the wire

Eclipse: 2nd Dawn of the Galaxy: 9/10
-4X that doesn't go on forever!
-4X that ends too soon...
-amazing bredth of choices, and component quality and storage/organization.
-long rebook. Took three turns and then flowed super smoothly. 

Everdell: 9/10
-most beautiful game I've ever seen. 
-I love the mechanics and components and theme. Can't wait to play again. 

Spirit Island: 8/10
-I get it. In the middle of the game I was having a ton of fun. 
-setup and learning curve just a bit too much. 
-a lot going on. Hard to motivate to play again even though I had fun.  

Innovation: 10/10
-this is the best tableau/hand management/engine builder I've ever played. 
-seems hard to learn because of bad rulebook.  It's actually not bad. My 10 year old son loves it. 
-plays fast. Lots of variability. Love it. 

Jaipur: 7/10
-fast and smooth hand management and set collection game. I enjoyed it but didn't love it. 

Marvel Dice Throne: 5/10
-forgetabble. Too much luck. I'm not sold. 

Mountains of Madness: 5/10
- unnecessary hard mechanics and rules. 
-the redeeming quality is the madness function which is more fun than the skill test gameplay. 

My City: 8/10
-legacy Tetris town builder. Need I say more? Bite sized fun. 

Nemesis: 6/10
-wanted to love it. Trying to sell my copy for $65+ you pay shipping because I just didn't enjoy it. Too fiddly. 

Raiders of the North Sea: 8/10
-excellebt worker placement game. One of the best I've played before. 

Raptor: 7/10
-asymmetrical goals and mechanics  quick gameplay.  Has nice little mechanic to do actions or play card events based on the lower number of the cards played. It's nifty. Not great, but a welcome light game. 

Schlotten Totten 2: 7/10
- truly a 15 minute game. Fun little set builder where best three card set wins a stone. Easy to teach, fun to play filler game for two. 

Skull King: 8/10
-the crew remains the most interesting trick taking game but this is the best larger group one. Highly recommend. The betting on yourself mechanic and card relationships makes this a winner. 

Sniper Elite: 7/10
- I love hidden movement games ever since owning Clue: Museum Caper as a child. I heard such good things about this, but it fell a little flat on first play. Going to try again soon. 

Specter Ops: Broken Covenant: 6/10
-it's really no different than the other specter ops game - which does scratch an itch for me in the genre of hidden movement. But it's not the best. 

Splendor Marvel: 6/10
-it was ""okay"". Theme hits for me much more than regular splendor. But the mechanic is just kind of boring for me. 

Star Wars: Outer Rim: 8/10
-loved the theme, and my new favorite pick up and deliver game. I want the expansion now. 

Survive: Escape from Atlantis: 6/10
-is it sad that I can't remember how it even plays?

That time you killed me: 10/10
-this is my new favorite mechanic. If you can call it one. Here's the gist: take chess pawns, give them travel abilities, let them alter time in different eras with crazy unique actions, all in the name of killing the other pawns in 2 of the 3 eras first. It's so fun. 

Temple Raider: 6/10
-roll dice. Do basic addition. Move pieces.
-theme is very cool. 
-a little bit gotcha play
-kids like it. Found it boring. 

The Fox in the Forest: 7/10
-a very fun two player trick taking game. I kinda was hesitant to believe two player trick taking was possible. This disproves me. 

The Quacks of Quedlinburg: 7/10
-everyone's favorite push your luck game!
-I prefer Cubitos but this is good. 
-I would like to play for once with other adults. Might help my score here. 

The Quest for El Dorado: 7/10
-I need to play this again. With adults. Played teaching my 7 year old. It's a fun little racing and deck builder game. 

The Siege of Runedar: 8.5/10
-I really enjoy castle defense games and this one has the best theme for me. There is a lot of RNG but it almost doesn't matter because of the amazing theme and cooperative play. 

Twice as Clever: 7/10
-another one I cannot remember how it played. Will play again but initial ruling was ""pretty good"" for roll and write. 

Twilight Inscription: 8.5/10
-I actually really liked this and want to get it to the table again. First entry in roll and write games and I did really enjoy the different choices and boards to work with. 

Tyrants of the Underdark: 8.5/10
-as far as deck building goes, this is a very good one. 
-the rest of the gameplay with area control in mind does land very well. Glad I bought it. 

Under Falling Skies: 8/10
-this is a fantastic solo game that makes me picture old school arcade games while playing it.  It's hard. But it's fun!

Unmatched Cobble and Fog: 6/10
-battle game with different powers for each player and point to point movement. I didn't hate it. Didn't love it either. Sold it.

Watergate: 9/10
-let me clarify: this is nothing like Twilight Struggle's influence on a map mechanic, but it shares action points vs events mechanic and political theme nicely. To me, this is a shorter, less fiddly twilight struggle. And I love both games. 

Whitehall Mystery: 6/10
-my least favorite hidden movement game. Fond memories of letters from whitechapel didn't translate well to fun ten years later. 

Wonderland's War: 9.5/10
-it's fiddly. It's outlandish. It's crazy looking. But honestly my first play was a ton of fun. Get your hands on this and force yourself to learn it. 

King's Dilemma: 9/10
-so far after three plays the narrative experience is like nothing else. To describe it more would be to ruin it. A must play.

"If you're anything like me, and I know I am, sometimes you just know that this Archduke guy has way too few holes in him, and it would be sweet to fix that. So I'm looking for games that allow to murder kings, queens, and all manners of other royals. A few criteria:

- Players must have the agency to do the killing. Games with royals dying by the event cards, or as part of a game rules, or whatever don't count.

- Games where royals can die or be killed in battle don't count either. Only assassinations, riots and executions.

So far I'm aware of these games: 

-Regicide

"This is our story of creating a digital tabletop game companion for all players and publishers. It's been a long journey with many lessons to learn, unexpected twists and turns, and how we’ve been trying to stay fluid in our approach. This is the story of Dized.  
I have known the company's co-founder Tomi since elementary school. This was before the internet in the early 90s, at which point we'd already been interested in games for years -  both video and tabletop. Growing up in the 80s my family had a Commodore 64, and I believe Tomi had an Amiga 500. I remember Tomi was usually the one who managed to get his hands on the latest cool titles. We often created scenarios for games like AD&amp;D and HeroQuest. I had started ""modding"" games even earlier, as I remember crafting an extra bit of road with a couple of more estates to the board game called Hotel, and using a butter knife to detach all the tiles from the Labyrinth board so that every row and column was moveable.

https://preview.redd.it/g9nfyojrm39a1.jpg?width=1440&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=62df0ea82c49d453c2e80a53f4cfca967c7e9966

In the early 2000's we were involved with some video game related projects but nothing considering tabletop games, until in 2013 we coincidentally had both started designing a board game at the same time. This led to a discussion about us potentially doing something in the tabletop game industry, and in 2014 we decided to found Playmore Games Inc.

An important aspect for us was to combine the possibilities of digital content and board games. We both have backgrounds in IT and this was something we could already start to see happening in the Board Game industry, with titles like XCOM: The Board Game and the Unlock! Series.

In 2015 we published our own board game Race to the North Pole, and with that we visited several international game expos in 2015 and 2016. At those shows we pitched a variety of digital content ideas to many publishers. The one that resonated the most and pretty much universally was the ""interactive tutorial"". At the time we pitched it as being like a video game tutorial which teaches you while you play, but for a board game. You know, a ""skip the rulebook and play immediately"" sort of thing. This seemed to be so interesting for publishers that we decided to pursue this avenue first.

https://preview.redd.it/69mwq1ftm39a1.jpg?width=1440&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=055b4281ca76043b78f5f52bda37025ce6d7979c

We hired our first employees and created some prototypes. We tested these in practice at expos and conducted some surveys. According to our findings we determined that a good size of the audience prefers learning games from others. It seems that in the 21st century people prefer to be able to lean back and simply enjoy a new game. Perhaps a trend started by the video game industry by ditching the manuals in the 90s? Anyway, this easiness in getting into a game was the leading principle when we started developing the model for the Dized tutorials. By the way, we picked the name Dized as it's the first and last letters of the word ""digitalized"", and also a wordplay on dice. I believe we finally settled on the name when we were able to secure dized.com for a few hundred dollars, which felt like a pretty good deal.

https://preview.redd.it/d0dw3e8vm39a1.jpg?width=1440&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=803bf408b21592ccc28d14463fa9852f75bde701

https://preview.redd.it/uibrxd8vm39a1.jpg?width=1440&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6af28393238fa24acce9b5182ce9137a4014d3a7

https://preview.redd.it/salpzd8vm39a1.jpg?width=1440&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8754084929a2512c4374ec4adcce058cb7ea30b1

So, the idea of a digital play-along tutorial seemed to be viable in theory but we wanted to test the commercial aspect of it as well. For this, we ran an Indiegogo (IGG) campaign in 2017. We chose IGG because running a Kickstarter (KS) campaign as a Finnish company was not possible, or rather would've required a lot of extra steps. The campaign did okay and Dized actually became one of the most crowdfunded apps ever.

https://preview.redd.it/t35pqzlxm39a1.jpg?width=1440&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cfaefb57b40a116644fff8d629f76e3a2ea7c12d

We had however underestimated both the amount of effort it would take us to get the platform built, and the amount of resources we would have available. During the Indiegogo campaign we estimated it would take us about a year to get the platform up and running. And to be fair, this might've been the case if we would've been able to raise something in the millions, but a $150k campaign wasn't going to get us there so quickly.

We did our best with the resources we had and were able to publish Dized Rules tool by the end of 2018. Dized Rules is basically a digital version of a rulebook that includes the game FAQ and a search engine. These rules are created on a browser-based tool and can easily be updated. The reason we focused on the Rules tool first was simply because it was the easiest part to get done, and something that could already on its own be beneficial for players.

https://preview.redd.it/4r4gzdwym39a1.jpg?width=1440&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03aae9867cbed2cfe09e30c622838bc11f8a7dd4

The Rules tool was created because we had determined that the ability to ask any question at any moment of the learning process was important to players. With the Rules tool you can check a rule, no matter if it's already been covered by the tutorial, or if you just simply want to know it. That's why we felt that the tutorial alone wasn't enough, and that the service should include the full game rules and an FAQ, all fully indexed, cross-referenced, searchable, and updateable. This is similar to how some games come with two manuals; a quick play guide and a thorough rulebook. We've learned that it's quite difficult to create a single rulebook that is great for both teaching the game and acting as an efficient source material for solving rule-related questions. Thus we divided Dized's method of providing rules into Tutorials and Rules, and started with the easier one to develop.

We had also gotten a decent amount of feedback during the IGG that more people would've backed the campaign, if it would've been on KS instead. Feeling that we might've missed some potential, and with the help of a recent investor who had a US based company, we ran a KS at the end of 2018. That's also when the Dized Rules tool was published. And true enough, while the campaign wasn't a runaway success, it did raise over $100k, which again was really good for a digital product.

https://preview.redd.it/wr7i7pzzm39a1.jpg?width=1440&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a33f87c0e02e3e1d6bf12529925a0612e320a5e9

With the crowdfunding campaigns under our belts and wanting to push out the tools as soon as possible we launched a private equity investment round in early 2019. We were aiming to be able to raise enough somewhat quickly so that we could deliver the tutorial tool by the end of the year. Unfortunately we did not hit the goals and instead of growing the team we had to downsize it, which naturally made the progress even slower.

We got the first version of the Tutorial tool live in the spring of 2020, just after the pandemic started. We were hoping to show our new content creation tools to many industry operators but the lack of expos made it a much bigger challenge. The pandemic also caused the global shipping prices to rise and we felt like the uncertain times made it more difficult to get publishers to hop on board to a new digital platform. At the same time focusing fully on sales was difficult as we were still fixing bugs and developing new features for our content creation tools. The industry survived the pandemic quite well overall, but for us the timing didn't work since our product wasn't ready enough.

https://preview.redd.it/7qzuc221n39a1.jpg?width=1440&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=90afb5fce3e2a69896328d0b62015e7b6e43e539

Instead of officially launching the platform during the pandemic we focused on developing new and improving existing features. In May 2020 we published the Dized Rules on the web so that it was easier to share and could be search engine optimized. Until this point content had only been available on the iOS and Android apps. The first tool made tutorials were published in summer of 2020, and included Time Breaker, Carcassonne and 7 Wonders. In total we managed to publish 10 tutorials in 2020. Before this the few tutorials we had on Dized were custom made with Unity 3D.

https://preview.redd.it/j3bgey22n39a1.jpg?width=1440&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe7d14aa0879fef00fc63e4013bee3a88fe4c10d

In 2021 the lack of expos continued and even though the digital versions of them were quite well organized, they did not match the experience and success we've had at in-person shows. During this time we still continued on bringing more important features to Dized; all content including Tutorials was made available on the web, and we added localization support, so that any content created on the platform could be localized to other languages. We were able to publish 18 tutorials, which wasn't nearly as much as we had hoped for, but at least it was an increase from the year before.

This year (2022) has been quite a challenge for us. We have continued working with a very small team and limited resources with the goal of getting the platform officially published, as this would also mean revenue streams. With a tremendous push from our team we were able to make this happen now in December, and somehow we even managed to double the speed of new content, publishing some 40 new contents to Dized this year! We've also seen the first DLCs (downloadable contents), which we call Extras. Dized Extras are used together with a board game for some additional content, like a score calculator, soundtrack, dice roller or even full blown digital game expansions.

https://preview.redd.it/epg9zra3n39a1.jpg?width=1440&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa1d7d680e8601089064adb371d3b3c8bc66028a

https://preview.redd.it/wnxxxra3n39a1.jpg?width=1440&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=33d1c01bdd9d5dc57c4ee4da3a16d5826e3fd58f

So, we did eventually get there! Definitely not in the desired timeline, and not exactly with the size of library we were hoping to launch with. It's frankly amazing that we were able to publish the platform at all after all this time. The thanks for that goes for the unbelievably amazing and resilient Dized team, our critically important investors (many of them from the board game industry), and the people who have constantly reminded us that what we do, matters.

Board games are an awesome power in the world and apart from being just for entertainment they do a lot of good for helping people deal with a vast variety of different challenges. A lot of inspiration and motivation can stem from knowing that you're building something that could have a real positive impact in the world. And perhaps this is already happening, as in December alone players have seen well over 1 million tutorial steps on Dized, and we've had over 200,000 users on the platform this year. It feels like a promising start!

https://preview.redd.it/x1cm0dl4n39a1.jpg?width=1440&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b92c7fac46f3cb9dd9f0d61b0ce3fe318e4e3ae

I'm sure more talented people could've made this happen faster. We didn't really have relevant experience in running a company, working in the board game industry, or building a global brand. In the end we were just enthusiastic gamers with an exciting idea, who have learned a lot on the way. In retrospect there are many, many things we should've-could've-would've done differently. I don't even fully understand how it is suddenly 5 years later that we got this out, although I guess the past 3 years have been a bit of a haze for many others as well. 

Knowing now how long it took us to get the platform built we did our crowdfunding efforts way too early (well, unless we would've been able to raise a lot more that is). We also tried to achieve too many things at once which is probably mostly my fault. I believed it was important to get Dized out on all platforms, all languages, and serve every operator from publishers to retailers for it to truly be an inclusive platform. And to be honest, I still believe that, but I do admit we should've started with smaller goals and better focus to get to publishing sooner.

We've gotten amazing user feedback this year and for the first time it now really feels like this could actually become something. There is so much more we want to achieve with this platform, and hopefully with the sales now starting and some VERY exciting projects in the pipeline (some of which we cannot publicly even talk about yet), we are looking for a promising new year!

There are so many stories from over the years I wish I could tell, but I believe this post is already too long. Thank you for reading it, and please let me hear in the comments if you already have an experience with Dized, or what would you wish to see on the platform in the future!

With that I hope you will all have a game-rich (and rulebook-light) 2023!

Best,  
\-Jouni (CEO, Dized)

"2022 was a great year for board games. I played some amazing games and it was great meeting up with folks after the last couple of years. I also acquired many many games this year, the sales were so good. You will notice that my ratings are probably a little on the higher side, this is mostly because I do a lot of research before I buy games and end up buying only the ones I think I'll enjoy. When I go to meetups, I do play others' games so most of the variability will come from there. Also most of my plays are at 2 players, since I play with my partner outside of the meetups.

I follow this guideline on rating, with one small change I allow for half levels like 6.5, 8.5 etc [https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/ratings](https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/ratings)

\*\*Res Arcana\*\* - 5/10

The first game I played this year and an unexpected disappointment. While I enjoyed the first play, every subsequent play has been lesser fun. Not many interesting choices, the theme and artwork are straight up boring. 

\*\*Potion Explosion\*\* - 7/10

Only played this one time, neat little puzzle, would be happy to try more. I've played on the app but without the feel of those marbles it didn't work as well. 

\*\*Krass Kariert (aka Dealt)\*\* - 4/10

Couldn't really remember the game without the BGG page. It was fine. 

\*\*Rat-a-tat Cat\*\* - 4/10

Ok filler, played a few rounds while waiting for others to come. Nothing really worth mentioning. 

\*\*My City\*\* - 8/10

We still have a few chapters left but we've loved this game. The theme is boring, the components meh, and artwork absent. Despite of all this, the game is soooooo good. One of the best games from The Doctor. 

\*\*MicroMacro Crime City - Full House\*\* - 8/10

Amazing game, gives me some back and neck aches, lol but both me and my partner really enjoyed it. 

\*\*Teotihuacan: City of Gods\*\* - 7.5/10

I loved this game and the rondel mechanism, it will probably go higher if we can manage more plays of this game.

\*\*Villagers\*\* - 7/10

Very good tableau building game but after 4-5 plays not a lot to go back for. 

\*\*High Society\*\* - 8/10

Is the doctor good or what? One of my all time favorite auction games, (the other is probably Ra). Such a limited decision space, so much depth and even more fun. I think this portrays why he's one of the best game designers ever. 

\*\*The King is Dead\*\* - 8/10

Played this at a meetup, nobody in my group has it so I've not been able to play this since. The game was very interesting with a limited decision space again. I guess I enjoy that. 

\*\*The Search for Planet X\*\* - 9.5/10

This has been a 10/10 for a long time for me, but I think I miss not being able to talk freely about my choices with my partner on this. Usually player interaction isn't a big deal to me, but the absolute silence during this game while we're both behind our screens trying to crack the puzzle is the only negative. The deduction puzzle is so much fun and exactly the kind of game I like to spend my spare time on. 

\*\*The Crew: Mission Deep Sea\*\* - 10/10

Trick taking and cooperative. This was always going to do well in our house. I've loved every play of this and will happily sit down anytime to play this, even with the 2 player variant which apparently isn't very popular according to BGG.

\*\*Imperium: Legends\*\* - 9/10

Revolutionary deck-builder for me. Over the years I've felt deck-builders have gotten too formulaic, this refreshed that for both my partner and me. It helped us realize why it's one of our favorite mechanisms after all these years. Grabbed Classics during the Barnes and Noble sale. Can't wait to try that.

\*\*Lost Ruins of Arnak\*\* - 8/10

Solid game, incredible production. Don't have a lot of new things to say about this one but we enjoy playing this. Waiting for a deal on Expedition Leaders before our next play. 

\*\*Bitoku\*\* - 8.5/10

Oh the theme, the art work and the explosion of colors. I love this game and really wish I could get it to the table more often. It just takes so much time to setup and tear down. Baggie hell. But if you can look beyond that, and the busy board underneath is a very solid game that combines deck building, worker placement really well. 

\*\*Welcome to the Moon\*\* - 8/10

Probably one of our top, flip (roll) and write games. We've only done 2 of the 8 missions and enjoyed it both. 

\*\*The LOOP\*\* - 8.5/10

Another refreshing take on deck building. Great Pandemic style game, bad shit happens, take care of it. The ""loop"" mechanism makes this a fun game to come back to. 

\*\*Kero\*\* - 6.5/10

Fun game, great components. 

\*\*Horrified\*\* - 7.5/10

Very good co-op. Has been a hit with every group I've played with. 

\*\*Chronicles of Crime: 1400\*\* - 7/10

Good game, I prefer when my partner is leading this and I can enjoy the story. Using the app and trying to deduct at the same time doesn't work for me.

\*\*Tiletum\*\* - 6.5/10

Good game but was too long at 4 players and we got an important rule wrong. Willing to try again but would probably stick to max 3 players. 

\*\*Ark Nova\*\* - 7.5/10

Terraforming Mars is here to stay in our household. I got this because it was supposed to be TfM killer which is probably one of my top 10 games of all time. But it totally missed the mark for me. The theme is nice and the gameplay, especially the action selection is very unique but overall I think it just didn't click as well. I'll still be playing it every now and then as I do enjoy it. 

\*\*Isle of Cats\*\* - 6/10

I thought I'll like this better than My City because of the theme and I definitely like the theme better but My City is so much more streamlined and a better game. Will probably sell it after a few more plays.

\*\*Under Falling Skies\*\* - 7/10

Great solo game, have 2 more scenarios in the campaign to complete so final rating might change. 

\*\*Celestia\*\* - 7/10

Push your luck fun. This works so well in meetups and we had a lot of fun playing this. Of course, it's extremely luck dependent but in the right setting that's a good thing. 

\*\*Dune: Imperium\*\* - 9.5/10

I am not a Dune fan, in fact I knew nothing about Dune before the movie came out. I expected this to be an overly complicated, mash up of mechanisms and it is but this was my biggest surprise of this game. There's deck building, worker placement, area control / conflict and everything works so well together. Keeping an eye out for Rise of Ix sales because this one is staying.

\*\*Hanamikoji\*\* - 8.5/10

Amazing 2 player game, it really works well for us. The limited number of actions make this a quick game but there is so much strategy still in it. This is a game I want to play more and more often and get better at.

\*\*Biblios\*\* - 5/10

I know this is supposed to be a classic but very forgettable for me.

\*\*Fort\*\* - 7/10

I want to like this game a lot more than I really do. I love the follow mechanism (in Tiny Epic Galaxies too), and that artwork is so fun but the game play is a little fiddly and a little too simple.

\*\*SCOUT\*\* - 9.5/10

Another gem, this ladder climbing game is streamlined to perfection (almost). I'm probably going to order this later today even though a friend has a copy.

\*\*Spirit Island\*\* - 6/10

This is a bit of a cheat, because I have played this before. Like 4-ish years back, once and I was not doing long games then. It lasted 3 hours, hated it and I have stayed away from it since. My taste in games have changed, so I wanted to try it again. It was fine, I just don't see the craze around this game. I think there are many better co-op games out there. I will definitely try a few more spirits and see if my opinion changes.

\*\*Cubitos\*\* - 6.5/10

I've played Quacks and didn't like that at all. I need to see the possible outcomes, I can't remember the tokens I put in there. So I wanted to try this, and this is definitely better than Quacks for me but still a little fiddly.

\*\*MANTIS\*\* - 7/10

Simple, quick and fun. Everything I am looking for in a filler.

\*\*Meadow\*\* - 9/10

Zen like. That's how I feel when I am playing this, it is so relaxing and so pleasant to play this. 4p games lasts a little too long but otherwise this is a great game.

\*\*Obsession\*\* - 8/10

Very interesting theme and game play, I liked the first play and I want to play more of this game next year.

\*\*Calico\*\* - 8/10

An incredibly cute brain burner, loved it but I think we will stick to 2p for this one.

\*\*Endangered\*\* - 7/10

A good co-op game, great theme, difficulty, and game play. Fairly smooth when playing and you always feel like you need to keep fighting for the animals.

\*\*Fog of Love\*\* - 7.5/10

Role-playing relationship as a board game for 2. A lot of laughs, discussions and surprises in this one. Will be playing a bit of this next year.

\*\*Mage Knight: Ultimate Edition\*\* - 9.5/10

Open world gaming, very few games got me going the way this one did. My all time favorite game is Gloomhaven, so I always thought I'd enjoy it but never did I think this much. In Gloomhaven, you grow stronger and stronger over the course of a campaign, at least many scenarios. Reaching incredible powers, where you can take down a horde of monsters in one sitting is so satisfying. I can't wait to play this more next year. Maybe even Solo.

&amp;#x200B;

That's all the games I played this year, here's my top 10 for the year.

1. The Crew: Mission Deep Sea
2. Mage Knight
3. Dune: Imperium
4. The Search for Planet X

"I tracked games on Google sheets and then did some data wrangling to sort and organize the data to make it easier to throw into Tableau, which is where the charts come from. In the pics I'm green and he's orange, and I thought this would be fun thing to share with you all.

Google sheets was good but in the summer I forgot to track some games we played outside, so there's some underreporting going on here. We definitely played **Castles of Burgundy** and **Viticulture** more than what's written down (they are not in the top 10 probably for this reason).

We mainly do 2 player light to medium weight games. Bigger games on the weekends, and shorter easier ones on weekdays after work, so the lighter weight games are most of the top 10 list.

Takeaways: we played the crap out of **Res Arcana**. It's fast and always a fun time. We play with all expansions but tend to not use the attack cards to eff each other over.

**Raptor** is the most thematic game I've ever played and it's insanely fun. We play this far more than what's recorded. I can't even be mad when he wins because we're both having such a good time playing the role of scientist or raptor. 

**7 Wonders Duel** can get very competive, and it's incredibly satisfying to win by technology or war. This game is probably the one where we get the most cutthroat. 

We've been playing **The Bloody Inn** for years and it's still a good game. If you're the type of player who wants to murder people who rent a room at your hotel and then take their money, this game is worth checking out.

I'm better at abstract strategy (**YINSH** is one of my favorites), and he's better at worker placement/tactical(?) games. When ties are excluded, he wins about 60% of the games and i win about 40%, which is kind of what I expected to see. 

Anyways, this was a fun thing to do.

"hi all! 

I'm running a pathfinder 2e adventure to a group of 3 players.

in this adventure the characters participate in a board game which is emulated by dice rolls but i thought i might be able to simulate it with an actual board game. here is the game description:

Blood Price is an economic strategy board game

simulating Geb (the setting's undead nation), its factions (5 great factions and few minor ones), and the machinations of the Blood Lords (50 rulers of the nation).

Each player who plays the game selects one of Geb’s factions. Each player begins with a starting position on the board, a special ability, a unique victory condition, and a bank of resources - all decided by their choice of faction. The Great Factions have the most powerful starting positions, but the game is balanced so the lesser factions can be victorious. Players make deals with each other, trading resources and establishing alliances. Any player might win alone, but a joint win—by players who work together—is actually more likely. In any case, the game ends after 6 turns.

you earn blood points during the game.

Winning the game requires 10 Blood Points at the end of a turn, but players can form alliances to reach that total, adding their Blood Points together. if two players (or an alliances) each have 10 or more Blood Points at the end of a round, the one with the most Blood Points wins; in the event of a tie, the game continues another round, but if the tie isn’t broken in the following round, nobody wins. Similarly, if no player or alliance has 10 Blood Points at the end of the sixth round, there is no winner.

obviously there is no game which is 1:1 to this description but what might be a close comparison?","simulating pf2e ""blood price"" with a real board game",1,self.boardgames,zz24cl,YonatanShofty,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/zz24cl/simulating_pf2e_blood_price_with_a_real_board_game/,1672411235

"I've played the game a couple of times, and while I started to love it dearly there are some things that I find sort of annoying - one of them is dying.

Dying (sometimes because of terrible RNG) and sitting out of the game for an hour while the other players continue the game is just plain boring. And sure you can play as an intruder, but it seems more like an afterthought than an actual fun game mechanic.

"After a disater year with pandemic in 2021, this year I got to play more but I lost my regular group so I played a lot of 2 players games with my girlfriend. I only have time on the weekend but I buy too many new stuff so most games here only get a few plays, I need to control my spending habit. Here are some brief thoughts on each of them!

**6 nimmt!**: very fun party game that can be play up to 8 players. I have tried from 3 to 7 players and we always had a good time.

**7 Wonders Architect**: too simple and boring, just draw from the deck every times and occasionally from your left or right when something fit your need, my girlfriend love it though and play a lot on BGA.

**Air, Land, and Sea: Critters at War**: fantastic 2 players game, I prefer the cartoon art on Critters at War version. 

**Barenpark**: played 6 online games on BGA only, I wanted to checkout the game before buying. I like polyominoes in general and I enjoyed Barenpark, but I didn't buy it in the end, I think it's very fiddly in practice.

**CABO**: relaxing game to wind down at the end of session when everyone is tired. It's a memory games with only 4 facedown cards but we tend to forget them all while chatting so it's usually a surprise when we reveal them at round end.

**Can't Stop**: 11 online play. It's an okay push your luck game, the outcome is calculated for you on BGA so it's faster here, not worth buying the physical version.

**Canvas**: the card is made from plastic and quickly get scratched over time. My GF is an art teacher so I think the theme will suit her, aaaaand we didn't like it. It's too simple, we both ask ""Is that all?"" after the first play, go to sell list immediately.

**Castle of Burgundy**: heard about this game a lot and I found a second hand copy. It's a dice game but I have never felt that I won or lost a game based on luck. Fantastic at 2p but 3-4p is way too long.

**Coloretto**: okay filler game. I like it more at 2-3p count, you have a lot more control over which card to get, 4-5p is too chaotic for my taste.

**CuBirds**: online play and only 2p with my GF. Another okay filler game, not worth buying the physical version.

**Durian**: bought this along with a bunch of Oink Games from Japan. Fun and fast party game, better at high player count.

**It's a Wonderful World**: the engine building part is good, but it's very multiplayer solitaire for me, I never care what my opponents are doing, go to sell list now.

**Land vs Sea**: good looking tile laying game. I read some advices that we should go for small group of tiles to get score more often, and we totally do the opposite. Very fun game at 2p, I want to try the 3p variant some day.

**Let's Make a Bus Route + Let's Make a Bus Route: Dice Game**: flip and write game from Japan, a twist is that everybody draw on the same map to make the best bus route. The bus planning part is okay but it's too multiplayer solitaire for me, the map get busy in late game but there was only 2 or 3 times we cross others' path. The dice game is 2p only, it's a little bit better but I have many more games I want to play at 2p count.

**L.L.A.M.A**: the UNO-killer from Reiner Knizia, it's a fun, quick, simple card game with some level of risk and reward evaluation, I really like it.

**Long Shot: The Dice Game**: very fun party game, it looks like a betting game but actually every player is a mafia gangster trying to manipulate the horse race. With the original rule it has a little high downtime so I told everyone to play simultaneously if you are sure your action won't affect anyone else.

**Medici**: I always enjoy auction games and Medici is simple but very fun, engaging all the time and intense until the last card draw.

**Mesina 1347**: play a friend's copy, it took 3 hours for one game. It was released last year but look and play like a very old Euro game. It's just okay for me, not bad but nothing make me want to go for it again.

**My City**: my first legacy game. I think this game has lots of creativity but I don't enjoy it. Most of the time you will feel frustrated because whatever you plan didn't work out and there's nothing you can do about it. Sometimes the game reward you with a choice but next game the rule is changed and your reward will hurt you. I stopped around chapter 10 and don't plan to come back to it.

**New York Zoo**: oh look, another polyominoes game, and this one is definitely near the top of its genre. The breeding part remind me of other Uwe Rosenberg games which I really enjoyed. The race to finish feels fresh compare to point scoring in other polyominoes game.

**Oh My Goods**: oh my god this game is so good. Lots of crunchy descisions with just a deck of cards, I got both expansions and we are going through Longsdale in Revolt. Can't wait to play this again.

**Paris: La Cité de la Lumière**: very mean 2p tile playing game, you will play on a shared board so whatever you put down will strongly affect your opponent. I like it a lot, only a small complaint that the special power is not explain on the card, I have to refer to the rulebook a lot.

**PARKS**: good looking game and entertaining gameplay. It's a very relaxing game like **Tokaido** but the expansion add just enough complexity to make it a little more strategic and competitive.

**Project L**: this is literally Tetris the board game. I love Tetris, play Tetris 99 a lot on my Nintendo Switch, this game is a keeper for me.

**Port Royal: Big Box**: fun and simple with so much content and variability in this big box version. Highly recommend for people who like push your luck game and crave for more interaction.

**SCOUT**: totally deserve its Spiel des Jahres Nominee, fun and quick card game.

**Shamans**: the social deduction game for people who don't like social deduction game, LOL. Brilliant combination of trick taking and hidden role, this game is so unique, there's nothing else like that on the market.

**Shifting Stone**: played a few time with my friend's copy but mostly online play. It's fine with 2 players but higher than that it's impossible to plan anything.

**Skulls of Sedlec**: need a 5-10 minutes game to play while waiting for something? This is the game for you. It's also as small as a wallet you can carry it to anywhere.

**Sobek: 2 Players**: the production is very good, gameplay share a lot of ideas with **Jaipur**: collecting set of cards/tiles then exchange it for score. It adds some power card to change the flow but I think it's unnecessary. Such a disappointment after all the praise I heard about it.

**The Guild of Merchant Explorers**: the market is saturated with roll/flip and write but this is one of the better game in this genre, easily one of the best game of the year for me. I find the cycle of play here very satisfying, fill up the map then wipe it, only leave a few left, and your entry point will start from there, thinking ahead of next round can really pay off. Normally I don't like multiplayer solitaire but this is an exception.

**The King is Dead**: it felt a little bit random at first but the more I play, the more depth I find in this game. I like small games that deliver a punch like this. **
Brian Boru: High King of Ireland** is the next step I want to try but sadly it doesn't support 2 players.

**Ticket to ride: London**: it's the same old Ticket to Ride but can be done in 20 minutes intead of 1 hour, I vastly prefer this than the regular big box base version (still cannot beat some expansion like UK with technology cards).

**Tiny Epic Dungeons**: got it from kickstarter, I played this with my DnD group, they like it so much they demand it everytime we meet. I enjoyed the base game, it's not complicated as other big dungeon crawler but enough to keep me interest. Throw in the expansion and it become a 3 hours slog that you do the same thing over and over.

**Town 66**: another Oink Games, this time a tile laying. It feels like playing a competitive Sudoku. It's okay, short game can be done in 15 minutes.

**Valeria Card Kingdoms**: tableau building and dice rolling game, one of my most favorite of me and my GF. The art is very impressive, dice are big and chunky, setup and teardown is a little long with finding and shuffling the right cards. This is my first step into the Valeria universe, overall they all have very beatiful art and above average gameplay.

**Villages of Valeria**: another tableau building game. This time no dice rolling. It borrows a lot of elements from other well known games (San Juan, 7 Wonders, Splendor) and doesn't stand out much from these other games, it's just okay.

**Quests of Valeria**: if you compress **Lords of Waterdeep** down to only the quest completion part you get Quests of Valeria. It's not a bad thing though, the game flow is very fast, chaining combo feels satisfied, good game.

**Whale Riders**: this game is sold out everywhere I look, I'm glad to snatch it after 5 minutes someone post it on my facebook group. Dr Knizia has done it again, the game look very simple and basic on the surface but it turns into a surprisingly tense battle with lots of juicy decision.",Still in time for my list of 39 new-to-me games 2022,1,self.boardgames,zywgm6,go2_ars,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/zywgm6/still_in_time_for_my_list_of_39_newtome_games_2022/,1672392972

"ChatGPT is pretty good at giving guidelines for teaching board games. At least for Catan:

&gt; Catan is a popular board game that involves trading and building on the fictional island of Catan. To teach someone how to play Catan, you can follow these steps:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Start by explaining the basic concept of the game: players are settlers trying to build and develop their settlements on the island of Catan. The goal is to be the first player to reach 10 victory points.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. Set up the board according to the instructions in the rulebook. The board consists of hexagonal tiles representing different types of terrain (e.g., forests, pastures, mountains, etc.) and numbered circles that represent the resources that players can collect.
&gt; 
&gt;3. Explain the different types of resources and how they are used. There are five types of resources in Catan: wood, brick, sheep, wheat, and ore. Players use these resources to build roads, settlements, and cities on the board.
&gt; 
&gt;4. Explain the role of the dice and how players collect resources. Each turn, players roll two dice and collect resources based on the numbers rolled and the locations of their settlements and cities on the board.
&gt; 
&gt;5. Explain how players can trade resources with each other and the bank. Players can trade resources with each other using a 4:1 trade ratio, or they can trade with the bank using a 3:1 trade ratio.
&gt; 
&gt;6. Explain the development cards and how they can be used. There are three types of development cards: knight cards, victory point cards, and resource cards. Knight cards allow players to move the robber and steal resources from other players, victory point cards award players with victory points, and resource cards allow players to collect resources.
&gt; 
&gt;7. Explain how the game ends and how the winner is determined. The game ends when a player reaches 10 victory points, or when all of the development cards have been played. The player with the most victory points at the end of the game is the winner.
&gt; 
&gt; Remember to refer to the rulebook as needed, and consider playing a practice round to help players get a feel for the game.

"The reason I compare them is because they are incredibly similar games.  They have the same base concepts and play exactly the same, except certain terms are changed and Lizard Wizard adds more.  It takes place in the same world of Astoria as Raccoon Tycoon, except it's in the mythical magical medieval times.

It has the stock market aspect, however the commodities are called ""Reagents,"" and represent magical and alchemical components.  You also sell them for mana, rather than money.

Instead of Rail Tycoons, you have wizards, and instead of towns, you have Wizard Towers.  There are 7 different unique wizards, and 7 unique towers (with multiple copies of each in their respective decks), each associated with a school of magic.  You gain bonus points at the end of the game when you have wizards and towers in matching pairs of magic schools.  You wager mana for the wizards in a bidding war, and you can spend reagents or gold to purchase towers.

You can research and cast spells.  These are one-time use abilities that cost mana to purchase reagents to cast.  Some of them have ongoing effects, such as ""+10 to Reagent Storage"" (since you can only have 10 reagents, +1 for each tower).  Some spells have offensive abilities, such as stealing or destroying another player's cards, and some have defensive abilities.  You get bonus points when you cast spells that have the same school as your matching Wizard/Tower pair.

You can purchase familiars with mana.  They offer no end game bonus points, but they do have powerful abilities, basically allowing you to take a free action.  You get to choose from 4 abilities: gain gold, gain extra reagents, buy and cast a spell, or enter the dungeon.

Entering the dungeon is a gamble.  You flip over the top of the deck and it's either treasure or a monster.  If it's treasure, you can keep drawing a card until you hit a monster.  1 monster = 1 hit.  You can continue drawing cards, but if you draw a second monster, you shuffle all of your revealed cards back into the deck.  You can quit at any time.  Kind of a big risk/big reward, but you can get punished by being too greedy.  Monsters always get shuffled back in the deck, but you get to keep your treasure, meaning the next venture into the dungeon has a higher risk of monsters.  The treasure cards will either give you gold coins, or bonus points at the end of the game.

When either the wizard, tower, or familiar deck is completely depleted, the game is over.  Everyone who hasn't gone for that round gets to take their turn, and then you add points.

It adds a couple new levels of complexity to Raccoon Tycoon, but without it being too overwhelming or confusing.  You only get one action on your turn (except familiars can let you cast multiple spells if you have the resources to do so), so you have to balance between gathering resources, gathering mana, or buying the various cards.  And, as soon as you think you're ahead, an opponent casts a spell that completely hoses your strategy.  My wife blew up my spell that let me hold more reagents, so I had to immediately give up half my resources, haha.  

I highly recommend it, I think it's an absolute blast.  And the artwork is just as adorable as Raccoon Tycoon.  I kind of wish that I had the money to back it because I think there's a deluxe set out there somewhere.","Played Lizard Wizard With My Wife.

"Hello, for the first time to you all! I've never been an avid board game player, sticking to card games and drinking when hanging out with friends (original, I know), but Munchkin has been a sort of revelation for the past 3 years since a new friend joined our group and introduced it to us. It quickly caught on as a fun way to show our worst and best selves while trying to keep our friends close and enemies cursed. However, I'm going to be abroad for a while, so I'd like some recommendations for a similar game I can get easily, including browser/mobile-based apps, to play with new people I meet and scratch that Munchkin itch. I would also love actual tabletop alternatives to play with friends when I return.

&amp;#x200B;

While I'm currently working in a country with a bit more limited access to more niche (or too recent) board games and will be for the next year, I'd try to buy something either with a lower shipping price or, if it's cheaper this way, get one of my friends a gamenerdz gift card, and ask them to post it themselves (after they obviously try it for themselves). As for online games to play with friends and new people, I'd also like some options. I was first happy to see the Munchkin beta on Steam and then disappointed by the bugs and limited content (I'm sure it'll be playable eventually). 

&amp;#x200B;

Here is a short list of requirements (or just recommend me something anyway):

&amp;#x200B;

1. A tabletop RPG or a similar type of board game that includes as many players as possible, with rules that are easy to understand as you play for the first time but take a long time to master. Our DM was beating a table of 4-6 players half the time at first and still wins more often than others due to knowing the cards and effects by heart. Still, we're slowly catching up to him, so this kind of learning curve is essential!

2. A light tone, preferably a comedy type of game, that does enough to keep a fun mood around the table without being either too cheesy (Munchkin does this a bit) or too serious. 

3. FUN!

4. A game that is not too niche or too new, so getting a copy doesn't get too troublesome or too expensive.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for your recommendations; I'll be sure to try anything I can to feel a bit closer to playing Munchkin!","Board games similar to Munchkin?

Highlights:

* Marrakesh is, imo, Feld's best game of all time. The way all mechanisms are smoothly integrated, the delicate balance between randomness and strategy, and all the possible strategies the game offer to the players are an ode to game design, and the proof that Feld still has his mojo.
* El Grande. I got it on a math trade for Stroganov. Couldn't believe my luck!!! It is a masterpiece of area control. A game with almost 30 years, and still so fresh and an example of design simplicity and elegance. Could have been designed last year.

Honorable mentions:

* Pax Pamir: although a bit swingy, is a masterpiece of intrigue and backstabbing. Cole Werhle is probably the hottest, more innovative designer out there atm.
* Beyond the Sun: tech tree done right. The benchmark of tech-treeing. A case study on how a game can be simple and elegant, without all the ""production value"", big boxes, bells and whistles. Almost infinite replayability. 
* Grand Austria Hotel, Marco Polo, Teotihuacan: These three show how the Italian school of euro-game design is still a powerhouse.

Biggest disappointments this year: 

* Hippocrates: I don't remember playing such a mediocre, repetitive, no-arc game since Flamecraft or Champions of Midgard. Zero ideas, zero innovation, zero effort. So inoffensive it's almost offensive.
* Mosaic - another mediocre, over produced, over priced, game  (and yeah, I know there is a retail edition, but I got the Colossus). Just another one in a long and boring trend of collect tags to get more tags.
* Ark Nova. This latter was the one that disappointed me the most. The hype was strong with this one, but it didn't live up to it, unfortunately, imo. A lot of good ideas, but completely undermined by the sheer size of its own deck. The care the designer put into having so many specific cards was the undoing and this game's worst enemy. If you get a good starting hand or a couple of good draws, you're set for the game. If not, you're just playing catch and the game actually punishes the players behind the leader.

"We just got our base copy of ""Marvel Zombies"" a few days ago, and had our first play-through last night. We did the first ""intro"" scenario (which was a cake-walk), skipped the second intro scenario, and dived into scenario three. Our group of five is well versed in Zombicide, so we knew the general rules going in. We're also Marvel junkies as well, so we were predisposed and had high hopes.

**The good**

The miniatures were awesome. Even unpainted, they're easily recognizable for who they are.

We liked the rule modifications to adapt to playing zombies. The ""hunger"" aspect made a significant change in playing style. At one point, one of our player went into ravenous mode, forcing their action to be entering a square with 9 mobs, and kill one (and just one) to feed on it. The look on their face was priceless.

I \*love\* that rolling a one increases hunger. It added a whole new dynamic to the game. A few times, players deliberately did not attack because they'd be chucking 7 dice, and they couldn't risk rolling two 1's. It's a really cool aspect.

Five of the six starting heroes are well balanced, fun, and enjoyable to play.

**The neutral**

For those used to zombicide... in Marvel Zombies, we found we shot up a \*lot\* more in exp than in various regular zombicide. Regular zombicide, we get to orange near the end of the game, sometimes someone gets to red. In our game, we were yellow within three turns, orange not long after, and all of us were somewhat close to red at game end. Example: on one of my turn, Hulk smash! I entered into a square with 11 mobs, and fairly easily killed them all over my next three attacks. I never would have done that in normal zombicide.

Unlike regular zombicide, players decide what order they choose to play each turn. Pros and cons to each. I kind of liked the rotation ""you go first"" aspect, but it certainly made things easier to plan/play when we could take turns as we wished. On the other hand, I also found that the quarterbacks tended to quarterback even more heavily, and the quieter players inevitably went last every round. 

The rule book was decent, but not great.Some times, I see that they tried to use visual depictions of the rules using pictures of a set up board, but it looked more like a dog's breakfast of confusion. The rules are fairly light, and I would think a 10 year old should be able to play them quite easily (assuming adults present the first few games until they got the hang of it).

Might just have been our scenario, but as we entered orange, holy crap, were there a lot of spawns each turn. We killed a lot, and they just kept respawning each turn.

Regular zombicide has items you find, which greatly can increase your power level. Marvel Zombies has no items to find; you can ""develop a trait"" instead, which gives a minor random power usable once. You can also gain followers (well, eat followers) that will give you powers as well. In general, much less game breaking than regular zombicide's items. You rely much more on your base character.

**The bad**

We noticed almost instantly that player character Deadpool sucks. I mean.... I love the guy as much (or more) than the next person. But his top end skill is horribly horrible, and even worse when you compare it to (say) Captain America's. Deadpool's skill = if you die, and you've made it to red, come back with 1 hp. Only usable once. Captain America's red skill = give another player a free action each turn. We made a house rule saying that each turn he rolled a D6, and on a 6 healed a wound. The character, as is, is severely unbalanced.

More disappointing than bad... I found the enemy superheroes were fairly underpowered. Almost all were one-shotted. Playing the first time, when we drew Black Panther, we were ""ooooooh, we're in rough, now!"". Then he got smeared in one attack and we all sort of looked at each other. We then did the math; a player Hulk with a 2 or 3 hunger (not hard in the slightest to obtain) kills him on just an average roll. I would have liked if they were more challenging. Even Thor was one-shotted.

The cost of shipping was obscene. No other word for it. Probably at least twice of what I expected (or what it should have been), even in the Covid era.

**Final Verdict**

We liked it! All five of us gave it two thumbs up. If you like Zombicide and have played it before, you'll probably like this version as well.",Marvel Zombies - my humble review,1,self.boardgames,zyijla,sad_puppy_eyes,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/zyijla/marvel_zombies_my_humble_review/,1672352804

"Frustrated as it’s been out of print for ages and I can’t find it anywhere.
Anybody knows where to buy it either new or second hand in Europe?? 
Based in U.K., my options that I can find are :

 100£ + 50£ postage to get it from US eBay 

A single person selling the game in U.K. for 200£

"I grew up playing Mexican Train with my family. It was a fun game that all ages could enjoy.

We had two different sets of rules that we played (we would agree on the version at the beginning). But after reading the ""House Rules"" post from earlier today, I realized that perhaps neither version is actually correct. And, I might not know how to play at all! If anyone is familiar with Mexican Train, please tell me which of my family rules are real and which are made up by my grandmother and her friends. 

Both versions were pretty similar. 16 rounds starting with double-15s all the way down to double-blanks. 

Everyone picks 8 or so tiles (depending on player count) from the bone pile. The player with the double for that round gets to go first. If no one has the double, everyone takes turn picking a tile until the double is found.

The double for the round goes in the center and every gets their own train starting with a tile that matches the center double. How we started our train initally was determined by which set of rules we followed.

Each round players take turns either adding a tile to their private train, adding a tile to a free train, or starting a new free train. If they could not do anything, they pick from the bone pile. If they still couldn't place their tile, their train became free for everyone but the player. 

To play a double on a train, you must pair in with another tile. If you play the double with a pair, the board freezes. You must pick a tile, if it pairs, you are safe, else you lose your train and the next person has to pick (either from their own hand or the pile). If they can't they lose their train too. This goes on until someone can satisfy the double.

To get thier lost train back, a player must play double AND its match on their lost train in the same turn.

Round ends when someone is out of tiles. Everyone else counts up their remaining dots. Then at the end of all 16 rounds, who ever has the least amount of point wins.

Here were the two rules for starting your private train

Longer Rules: 

	1. If you do not have a tile that matches the double, you must pick one tile on your turn until you find a proper starting peice. You cannot play on free trains unless you have already entered the game with your private train.

	2. If you have NEVER picked a tile, you may play all playable tiles on your first turn starting your private train. but if you picked once (even to find the double in the begining initially) you must start your train with only one tile.

Shorter Rules:

	1. If you do not have a tile that matches the double and you can place a tile on a free train, you can do so.

	2. When you first build your private train, you may use all playable tiles in that initial move, even if you picked pieces before hand.",I just realized that I might not actually know how to play Mexican Train,1,self.boardgames,zyfd7h,notarussianbotsky,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/zyfd7h/i_just_realized_that_i_might_not_actually_know/,1672345355
"Hi everyone ,

I would be playing solo ( i already play lotr card game ) , because dont know anyone to play with.

I like more of resource/ deplyoing and battling kind of games like risk.

I have a good deal of 100€ for war of the ring with 2 expansions. But dont know if it is really worth if i wont be playing at all.

Let me know yout thoughs about both games please to help me figuring out which one to try.

"I had recently became aware of this game and wanted to find it for my next purchase. We wandered randomly into Half Price Books after doing Barnes and Nobles 50% off sale on the 27th. We found Last Day on Earth with I believe 3 expansions AND it was only 40 dollars.

"It would not all fit in one post. Here is a link to part 1: [https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/zyeckd/i\_played\_over\_100\_games\_new\_to\_me\_this\_year\_here/](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/zyeckd/i_played_over_100_games_new_to_me_this_year_here/)

The majority of these games I played more than once, and some were only played online but most were in person. There were no perfect 10s for me, I reserve those for only my absolute favorite games that I feel capture the mechanics perfectly, although usually a game does not start at a 10 so one of these could keep rising. My ratings are basically as follows: A 6 or 6.5 is a good game I would play but probably not necessarily recommend, anything under did not work for me for one reason or another, and anything over is very good and I would recommend. Anything that is an 8.5 or above I consider to be amazing.

Sagrada – 7/10

This is a very good, medium-light weight game. You roll a communal pool of dice and draft them to complete your board while following placement criteria. I thought this one would be more luck-based, but it really does require planning and strategy. I never felt like I couldn’t do anything with the dice that were rolled. I recommend this one for people looking for something similar to Splendor in weight-class.

Shifting Stones – 5/10

This was one of the more recent games I played, and yet I barely remember anything about it. You move stones around and try to complete patterns. It was extremely forgettable and highly luck based, but it was light and quick. There are better games in this category.

Skull Canyon: Ski Fest – Unrated

I cannot give this one a proper rating because I played with my wife, and when we played we were not allowed to take control of other people’s routes. In Skull Canyon, you are skiing down a mountain claiming routes by being the first to ski, but you can spend additional resources to claim a route someone else claimed. Once you complete the round, there is a 2nd phase where you move forward on a path to gain resources, but you cannot move backwards. This game is very similar to Ticket to Ride with more going on. It was pretty fun and worth checking out if you like the theme. 

Skulls of Sedlec – 8/10

Yet another Button Shy game. This one is for 1-3 players and you collect skulls to form a pyramid. The skulls each score based on placement criteria and the highest score wins. For a game that takes about 5-10 minutes to play and less than 5 seconds to set up, it packs a lot into such a small package. Throw in different modules and expansions and you get a lot of replayability and variability. I always pull this one out when waiting for another player to arrive or in between bigger games. I highly recommend it.

So Clover! – 7/10

This is a good word game by the company that produced Just One. This one is also fully cooperative, the clue-giver has a square of words (2 words on each side) and tries to come up with 1 word for each side to associate the 2 words. Then the cards containing the words are removed, and the other players try to place them back on the board. It is fun and sparks good conversation, and it plays well with 3-4 players while Just One shines best with more than 4.

Spirit Island – 8/10

Spirit Island is a game with almost an overwhelming amount of content. You can play just the tutorial game for what I thought was an easy experience, add scenarios and/or invaders for a difficulty anywhere between a little harder to brutal. There are many different spirits you can play as, and each provide a unique and different experience. I prefer this game at 2 or 3 players, but I know a lot of people love this game as a solo game. I suspect my rating will go up as I continue to play as it already has, but it is absolutely worth checking out. Also I find the BGG complexity rating to be deceptive. It really is easy to learn and teach, but the complexity comes with the choices that you can make during the game. It is the only game in my collection with over a 4.0 complexity, but I would say games like Root or Batman: Gotham City Chronicles are far more difficult to learn. Don’t let the high complexity fool you, I was hesitant to try this game for awhile because I thought it would be too rules heavy but that is not the case.

Spongebob Squarepants – Plankton Rising – 5/10

I played “The Batman Who Laughs Rising” last year and also gave it a 5, although as much as I like DC it was nice to try a Spongebob game that had substance (my copy of Spongebob Monopoly wasn’t enough for me). The game is about rolling dice and placing them on characters and orders to gain them and use their abilities while trying to stop Plankton from stealing the Krusty Krab secret formula. I actually would recommend this game for hardcore Spongebob fans; they reference a ton of characters and it is fun to reveal a character you didn’t know had a name. That said, the game itself is not that interesting and your dice rolls are critical to actually having a productive turn.

Spot It – 3/10

I didn’t like this game very much, you try to spot images on 2 cards that match. This game is very popular though so really pay much attention to my rating. 

Star Wars: Jabba’s Palace (Love Letter) – 7.5/10

This may be my least favorite version of Love Letter other than the Marvel one, but it still is very fun. It is worth noting that I don’t really care for Star Wars as a theme. I really enjoy the Batman Love Letter and Lovecraft Letter. This one introduces new twists such as a different way to win each round rather than just highest card at the end, but there are some cards that are much more powerful than others. If you like Star Wars though, it is worth looking at before the others.

Starcadia Quest – 8/10

This game is similar to Ankh where I really liked it, but I wouldn’t play it over other games. It is a skirmish game where you complete different objectives based on the scenario. It is a free-for-all between each player with lots of combat and interaction, while also dealing with environmental hazards and enemies. The game’s theme is generic, but the miniatures are great and the quality in typical CMON fashion is excellent. 

Stella – 7/10

I enjoy this game, and I was eager to try it as I am a big Dixit fan. It was fun, but not better than Dixit in my opinion. All players are given the same word and select cards with beautiful art that they think other players will select to match that word, then one by one you guess a picture and score points if anyone else matched. It is fun and a good party or social game, definitely worth checking out if it looks interesting to you.

Suburbia – 7/10

This is a good game about building a city, increasing your income, and having the largest population. Each building or location you build is added to your personal grid and connects to at least 1 other building. This game is a good city builder and handles the theme pretty well. It plays very well at 2, I have never tried it at a higher player count. It is fun, but nothing too special.

Terraforming Mars – 7/10

I am probably in the minority on this one, but I played TM after playing Ares Expedition. I really enjoy Ares Expedition (see next game on the list for my short review), but I found it’s older brother TM to be unnecessarily longer and it adds down time while providing a near identical experience to me and my group. I still think TM is fun, but I sold it right after playing it a few times because I get the same experience in Ares Expedition in a much faster and smaller package.

Terraforming Mars: Ares Expedition – 8/10

Ares Expedition is a great engine building game. I actually learned this game on the same day as Race for the Galaxy and the 2 are very similar. It features simultaneous play and can be completed in under 1.5 hours. I like the game arc Ares Expedition features. At first, you really struggle to produce anything but towards the end of the game you are gaining resources like crazy. It feels good to get your engine running and every card in the game is unique. This also can be found for a fairly low price.

Tranquility – 7/10

This co-op game is a fairly different experience with other players vs solo. The object of the game is to fill a grid with cards played in ascending order with different placement rules, and if you complete the grid you win. With 1 players, you can see all the cards in the game and know if one you needed was discarded. With multiple players, you cannot communicate so you will never know if some cards were discarded from the game. It is a fun little puzzle regardless and plays in about 10 minutes.

Transmissions – 8/10

I think anyone that saw this game in a store or on Kickstarter was attracted to it because of the amazing art. The game behind the art is also very enjoyable. Even though the game is competitive, all players are moving the same robots around a circular track and collecting resources, objects, pipes, and upgrades to score victory points and increase each robot’s abilities. The game is fairly light but features some interesting decisions and there are ways to be mean and block other players, although when blocked you still have options that provide useful benefits. If you can find this game, I highly recommend it.

Tussie Mussie – 6/10

Another Button Shy game entry on this list, this one is a 2 player game about collecting flowers. On your turn, you place 1 flower face up and 1 face down for the other player to select, and whichever isn’t selected you get to keep. Each scores in a different way and the highest score wins. This game barely takes up any space and plays in about 10 minutes. It’s a pretty decent game for what it is.

Ugly Gryphon Inn – 5.5/10

This is the only Button Shy game I got rid of. It is a solo game about organizing patrons to an inn to make sure everyone stays without getting mad. This game has a lot of text on each card and it was hard to keep track of everything each turn. Of the solo Button Shy games, this once is probably the worst to actually play and can be skipped. 

Unicorn Fever – 7/10

I had been wanting to play this game for awhile and finally did this December. It is a game similar to Camel Up where you are placing bets on different unicorns in a race. In this game, you can manipulate the unicorns in different ways by placing face-down cards which effects, but that doesn’t guarantee the unicorn will do well or poorly. It was a lot of fun, but there were a lot of fiddly parts for how simple this game should have been. The art and silliness of it make it stand out though.

Unlock – 8.5/10

I am a huge fan of escape room games, and so far, the Unlock games I have played have not disappointed. I have played 4 different ones and each has felt unique and have had interesting themes. I also have played Exit games, and they are about the same in terms of enjoyment. Unlock does have better themes though and the fact that no pieces are damaged or destroyed is a huge plus. My favorite so far was the Animal-O-Matic, it did require some random outside knowledge but nothing too complex. 

Unsurmountable – 7/10

This is the final Button Shy game on this list. Another solo game, but this one is about creating a continuous path up a mountain and using abilities to change the layout so you can create a legal path. At first I was not very impressed with this game because it seemed way too easy, I was basically just building a path up a mountain and never used any abilities. On harder difficulties though, the game gets better. The game is at its best with the expansions combined, Dual Peak and Big Climb. If you pick this one up, absolutely pick up the small expansions. 

Vagrantsong – 5.5/10

I really wanted to like this more than I did. You play as vagrants riding a train dealing with haints (ghosts) that are up to no good. It is a boss battler game where you are trying to restore the humanity of these haints. I love the dark, cartoon theme and the concept, but the game is just way too random and there are plenty of turns in which you get bad rolls and do nothing. Very few of the items help you mitigate the rolls. On the plus side, the scenarios are very different and the story is very well written. Generally I prefer a healthy mix between theme and mechanics, often even preferring strong theme to great mechanics (I can take or leave a story/campaign). This game though I feel is a 10/10 for theme but the mechanics are so random, and honestly not great, maybe 3/10 for me. I wanted to enjoy this one but through all of my plays it didn't feel fun.

Veiled Fate – 7/10

This is a weird one to me, it feels more like an experience than an actual game. The experience itself is a blast and it supports up to 8 players seamlessly, however the gameplay is very basic. You secretly control a character, while all players are able to move and interact with each character on the board. You win if your character scores the most points. To gain points, you place a character in a location, and once it is filled they either score or do not score based on a voting mechanism. By the end of the game it is usually fairly obvious who is controlling each character (not always though), but it is fun nonetheless. 

Viticulture – 8.5/10

This one was a huge hit with my group and me this year. The objective of the game is to have the most victory points at the end of the game by mainly selling wine, but there are many other ways to score. It has a lot of strategy and enough luck to provide interesting strategies and tactics while also providing a different experience each time. I have seen so many different strategies win this game; pure wine making, no wine making, heavy card draw, no card draw, etc. All strategies seem to work well enough to be competitive, but the winner usually goes to who adapted the best throughout the game. When I got this game, I asked the question if it is worth playing without the Tuscany board. Most of the responses said it was essential, but I tried just the base game anyways. The base game is fine, I gave it a 7 or 7.5 With just the Tuscany board though, the game opens up and provides so many more options. The board itself is really essential and I recommend playing 1 game with the standard board to learn the mechanics, then immediately moving over to Tuscany. The Tuscany modules I could take or leave, although I did not like the orange structure cards at all because some are wildly more powerful than others.

WTF (What the Fish) – 2/10

This game is terrible, don’t bother with it. It is completely random and mean.","I played over 100 games new to me this year, here is a small write-up on most of them. Part",1,self.boardgames,zyedsi,JetsFly228,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/zyedsi/i_played_over_100_games_new_to_me_this_year_here/,1672343054

Anything that is an 8.5 or above I consider to be amazing.

7 Wonders: Architects – 5/10

A light game that I do think will appeal to a mass crowd. To me, there were too few decisions to make, it was too light, and the theme was not interesting enough to keep me interested. The rules are very simple to learn and this game really can be played with anyone, but it did not appeal to me.

Air, Land, and Sea: Critters at War – 7.5/10

This may be my favorite of the “lane battling” games (Schotten Totten, Battle Line, Lost Cities, Rift Force, etc.). There are plenty of decisions to make, and I really like the giving up mechanic that allows you to concede a lane early so the opponent scores more points. It is quick, simple to learn, and has very good art.

Ankh: Gods of Egypt – 8/10

Ankh is a great game that has well-made miniatures, excellent table presence, and is a very strategic and tactical game. The game has perfect information, meaning that you know everything at the start of the game. Everyone has the same hand of cards and they are used in battle. This makes for a tense fight because you know exactly what could be played against you. My only issues with this game are I would prefer Blood Rage at every player count except 2, and the controversial “Merge Rule”. I don’t hate the merge, but it hasn’t gone over well with everyone I played with. It is important to know that you have to plan the entire game around it.

Antidote – 4.5/10

A quick little game where you trade information and try to be the first to determine which color was removed from the game. It is quick and simple, but not very interesting and extremely luck based. This one can be skipped.

Aqua Garden – 8/10

This is a very good game, and it plays in 30 minutes. It has some of the best components in the game I have ever seen with its sea-life wooden figures. It is simple to learn, quick to play, and has the best implementation of the “Turn Order/Time Track” mechanism in a game in my opinion (move forward in a path but you can’t move backwards. Farthest back takes the next turn). It doesn’t really change the formula for this mechanism, but it is the only game I have played with it that I personally think jumping farther ahead can be more beneficial than just taking one of the next available spots.

Arkham Horror The Card Game – 8.5/10

I have only played the Night of the Zealot campaign twice (the core box), but I really like what I have played so far and I know the potential this game has. My most played game is Marvel Champions, so I already know I like the formula and the general system. This game is more story-based and has interesting mechanics that I have not seen in Marvel Champions but feel familiar. I have a feeling my 8.5 rating will increase once I get into the bigger campaigns.

Asking for Trobils – 7/10

I really like the art and table presence for this game. The main colors are orange and blue, and the art is very appealing to me (I tend to like sillier art in games). This may be the most welcoming worker-placement game I have ever played. The rules are simple and you are never truly blocked from a space; if it is taken you can bump the person out but they get their worker back.

Banned Books – 5/10

A quick Button Shy wallet game that requires pieces outside of the standard 18 cards. The game takes up very little space which is a plus, but the game isn’t very interesting and requires a decent amount of luck as a die roll can determine your turn.

Battlecrest Fellwoods – Unrated

I have played this game only in solo and I don’t know how I feel about it. It is a huge accomplishment that Button Shy and the designers managed to create a skirmish game with only 18 cards. The solo game is interesting but takes a little long (about 30 minutes) and managing the AI is a little fiddly. I want to try this with another person, once I do I will have a rating. As a solo game it is probably a 6/10 but I think it will be much better with another person.

Birdwatcher – 7.5/10

This is a pleasant game with excellent art and easy-to-learn rules. You collect sets of birds and publications to score points. It plays in about 20 minutes and it can be taught in about 1 to 2 minutes. If you need a filler game and really like birds, check this one out.

Blockbuster Returns – 6/10

A party game where you try to guess movie titles. Fine but not very interesting, however I did appreciate that most of the movies are common knowledge enough that you don’t have to be a movie buff to know them.

The Bloody Inn – 7/10

A fun game that has a very unique theme and interesting art. The premise of the game is that you are running an inn and you murder the patrons and steal their money. It is a light engine-builder that feels different from most; I never really feel like my engine gets rolling but that isn’t necessarily a bad thing. With how little time you have, you can focus in 1 to 2 areas or generalize in all of them. It’s fun, not really groundbreaking but it has a fun and unique enough theme that I will continue to play it.

Bohnanza: 25th Anniversary – 6/10

I don’t think 6/10 is fair rating but this game didn’t go over well with my group. You are collecting sets of beans to produce money/victory points. It needs to be played in more of a party setting I think but the group I played with tried to over-strategize.

Brew – 8/10

This is a very mean yet fun game with excellent art. You roll and place dice to gain resources and control areas to score victory points. You can also recruit animals to help you with their abilities and to score additional victory points. I find it is best with 2 players, but it is good with 3 as well. It also comes in a very small box and is easy to learn and play.

Bus – 8/10

Another very mean yet fun game. You are trying to get passengers to and from their desired location on a bus route. This game is intense because you are fighting over the passengers and they are first come, first serve. You place routes to get access to people and locations while cutting others off. And of course, you can manipulate time with a time stone. This game is very easy to learn for the level of depth it provides.

Can’t Stop – 3/10

I don’t like this game. You roll 4 dice, assign them to columns 2 through 12, and move your pieces up. You have to roll the same numbers until you bust or stop, if you bust you undo your turn. I like other push your luck games but this one just didn’t work with me at all.

Cascadia – 7/10

There are pretty much 2 strategy games I can play with certain family members – this and Azul. I wouldn’t choose to play with my main group because I think there are better games in the same weight class and time frame, but I have had fun playing with my family. You collect tiles and try and match biomes, while also placing animals in a way that matches their scoring conditions. This is an excellent gateway game, and I think heavier gamers can enjoy this as well.

The Castles of Burgundy – 7/10

I understand why this game is so beloved, but to me it is just “pretty good”. You roll dice to determine which locations you can place on or which tiles you can take, and there are plenty of ways to manipulate the dice values. I have never played this in person, only on BoardGameArena, but I don’t think I would ever want to with the amount of upkeep. The game is also ugly.

Cat in the Box – 8.5/10

A great trick-taking game with a neat gimmick: all the cards are colorless and you assign a color as you play it. Once you declare a color with that number, nobody else can claim it. There are 5 of each number and only 4 colors, so if someone cannot legally play a number/color combination they cause a “paradox” and the round immediately ends. It makes you really need to plan your round to make sure you don’t get stuck. If you don’t like trick-taking, this won’t change your mind but if you do, check this one out.

Chocolate Factory – 7/10

A very thematic game about running a chocolate factory. You move pieces through a conveyer belt and turn cacao into wrapped boxes of chocolate. You can upgrade your factory with new abilities. The components are excellent and the game feels good to play.

Chronicles of Crime: 2400 – 2/10

This was one of the worst gaming experiences I have had. I could see this being fun solo but with another player, one person uses the phone and sees all the text and the other does nothing. It is very story rich and has good art, and the app is good, but I don’t like this style of game at all. I do think this will appeal to others, but if you don’t like app-driven games, this will not change your mind.

Circle the Wagons – 7/10

A fun and quick, 2-player Button Shy game. It is basically competitive “Sprawlopolis”, you create a personal town and there are 3 different scoring conditions each game (all on the back of the cards). I recommend this if you want 5-10 minute game with a small footprint.

Coloretto – 6/10

I honestly don’t remember much about this game, it was very forgettable to me. I know you collect different colors and the top 3 or so score. It’s quick and simple, but not very interesting.

Conspiracy: Abyss Universe – 7/10

I did not like Abyss, but this pretty game different except for the art. You create a reverse-pyramid of cards and they score based on where they are located. It is pretty luck-based but enjoyable for how short it is.

Cosmic Frog – 7.5/10

This game was a monstrous pain to learn. The rulebook is awful and there are little-to-no videos about the game. Once we learned it though, it was very fun. Turn order is completely random, you draw a card with a color and if you are that color, it is your turn. The game is ridiculous as you control 2-mile tall frogs through space and you destroy planets/lands by throwing other frogs into them or eating them. Each person has a different ability too, and none seemed overpowered compared to others.

Cow, Tiger, Santa Claus – Unrated

Another Button Shy game on the list. This isn’t really a board game, it is designed for a road trip. You draw a card from 3 different difficulties and everyone in the car tries to find those objects. For example, you need to spot bleachers, a pumpkin, and a superhero. It was actually a lot of fun, and very exciting once you spot something.

Cryptid – 9/10

This is an excellent game. It is easy to teach and learn, quick to set up, and possibly has the best time-of-play to thinking ratio in any game I have played. You have to find to find the one spot on the board that contains the cryptid by figuring out all the rules based on objects and biomes, and every person at the table knows one of the rules. This game has gone over really well with everyone I have played with, from non-gamers to heavier gamers.

Cthulhu: Death May Die – 9/10

This is an excellent co-op game. It is highly thematic with the Lovecraft lore and has great miniatures. It features combat that revolves around rolling dice, but you can re-roll with abilities and a “stress” mechanic. It also features a sanity mechanic where you get more abilities as you go insane, but you are closer to death. The core box has a ton of replayability, despite there being a ton of other content for the game.

Dodos Riding Dinos – 7.5/10

This game is really stupid but is also really fun. It is basically Mario Kart in a board game. You control dinosaurs controlled by dodos to race around a track, and you flick, throw, and roll pieces at other player’s dinosaurs. This game has really funny art and great miniatures. 

Dog Park – 6.5/10

The deluxe version of this game has excellent components and great art, and if you love dogs this one might be worth it for that alone. The game itself wasn’t too interesting or unique though; you bid on a dog and try to collect dogs of certain types, then move through a one-way track, then gain resources. It is comparable to Wingspan, maybe a little lighter. Worth it if you love dogs but if not, it may be worth looking elsewhere for a light game.

Ecologies – 6.5/10

This is a small card game about collecting wildlife in certain biomes. Each animal has animals or plants that it can eat, and you build your way up the food chain. It is very luck based, but quick and fun. 

Empires – 6/10

I give this game credit for trying to create a heavier board game that supports up to 10 players, but it fell flat for us. It wasn’t very interesting of a game, the theme was boring and the art was bland. I don’t remember much else about the game though.

Encyclopedia – 7/10

This game was really close to being great, but it is only good. You collect sets of animals based on their color, research them, and then turn them in. The problem is, because there is no limit to how many you can hold, there is little incentive to turn in the sets before the end of the game if you can match their symbols. Also, the game feels too long by about 2 of the 6 rounds. The art is very good though and I think this one will appeal to people.

Eruption – 4/10

This is very similar to Munchkin but I think I would prefer Munchkin. You are trying to protect your land from lava paths, while simultaneously attacking others and send lava their way. There are attack cards, some clearly stronger than others, and you draw random tiles that you have to place. I did not like it very much, and I don’t think it is worth looking at, there are better games.

Final Girl – 6/10

I completely understand why this game is great, but I don’t like games that feel like they should have a lot of strategy but can come down to luck. All of my games came down to the last few dice rolls, and I am not a fan of that. That said, the production is great, the theme is fairly unique and really well implemented, and the game does capture the feel of being chased by a killer. I do recommend this solo game, but it didn’t work for me.

Flamecraft – 5.5/10

This was possibly my biggest disappointment of the year. The art is great, the components are great (except the playmat, it is unnecessary long and not very well designed), and the theme is neat. You move your dragons into shops, take resources and trigger abilities. The issue for me was there was very little decision space and resources were too abundant. Most of my turns I spent more time deciding which resources to keep or discard than actually taking my turn. I think this will appeal to people, especially because of the art and theme, but I didn’t like it very much.

Floriferous – 8/10

This is a great filler game. The art is very pleasant and the rules are simple. You choose to collect either a flower or scoring card, and based on the card you pick, that determines the turn order for the next turn. Games are about 20 minutes and it comes in a small box and takes up little space. If you need more smaller, quick games, check this one out.

Friday – 6/10

This is a neat solo game but I felt that it was too luck based for my liking. I also am not the biggest fan of deckbuilding, so this game probably is more enjoyable for those that do. You are trying to survive as Robinson Crusoe and deal with different threats. It is small and quick, so it is worth checking out if you like to play solo games.

Furnace – 6.5/10

I usually like both auction games and engine building games, so I am not sure why this one didn’t really click with me. You auction on factory parts that build up your engine, but if you lose the bid you still get a reward. Each person also has a player-specific ability that they can use. I need to try this one more because I think it has potential, but my first few plays didn’t click.

Genotype – 7/10

This is a pretty good worker placement game about Punnett Squares and learning dominant vs recessive traits. The theme is well implemented and the game is very well-designed, I just would prefer several worker placement games over this one. It is worth checking out though if you like science. Also the game says that green is dominant over yellow, but I am pretty sure the yellow trait is dominant. 

Ghost at Home – 2/10

I don’t remember much about this game but it was very random and not fun. You are trying to turn on all the lights in your house while others are sending ghosts to turn them off.

Hanabi – 6/10

A decent game about playing cards in the correct order, but you don’t know your own hand. Other players give you hints to what your card could be, and you are playing to achieve a high score or a perfect score (although you can lose). It was fun a few times but to me it lost its appeal quickly.

Heads Up – 5/10

A party game about guessing a word. It is pretty generic, fun but there are better options.

Honey Buzz – 6.5/10

This was perhaps my 2nd biggest disappointment of the year behind Flamecraft. I was after this game for awhile and ordered it right when it came back into stock. The art and components are excellent, but the game itself fell flat. I still like it and I want to give it more of a chance, but there are options in the game that seem clearly better than others until later, such as gaining money and selling honey over taking the victory point cards. I will give this another chance but it was just disappointing for me. I know others love it though.

Inis – 8.5/10

This is a great game that has a neat winning mechanic. There are 3 win conditions and you have to take a turn to announce you have a win condition, then if you still meet it next round you can win. The game is tight, there are a lot of decisions to make, and it features card drafting and passing, which is one of my favorite mechanics but with another neat twist. You can put cards back you already took as long as you exchange it with another card in your hand, or in other words you take 1 and pass the others, then take any 2 cards and pass, then take any 3 cards and pass, etc. It has a lot of familiar mechanics with well-implemented twists.

Keystone North America – 7/10 

This is a fun game with great art. The solo gameplay is really good, while the multiplayer is still good. You take animals and place them on your grid, each animal has an arbitrary number assigned and symbols based on their habitat. You are trying to get animals with matching biomes and symbols in numerical order across your board. The solo game takes you through a campaign with different winning conditions, which keeps the game fresh.

Kohaku – 7.5/10

This is a fun 30-45 minute game about collecting fish and scoring cards. Every turn, you take a fish and a scoring card and add them to your personal grid. Most scoring conditions involve collecting fish of specific colors. The art is very good and the game is peaceful and relaxing. I think this is also a game anyone could learn and enjoy.

Life of a Chameleon – 7.5/10

This game has by far the worst box size to components ratio of any game I own. It comes in a huge box when everything could fit in a “The Crew” sized box except for the board, which comes as 1 flat piece instead of being folded (which is a good thing but takes up more space). That said, the game is a lot of fun and is easy to learn. You control a color of chameleon and try to eat bugs matching your color. Snakes block your path but you can get by them by matching their color. There is some randomness with the bug placement and the card draws, and even when the game ends (each time a scoring condition is met, you roll a die and advance the time track. Once it hits a certain number, the game ends). But it is fun and light, with a pleasant and enjoyable theme.

Lords of Waterdeep – 7/10

This is a very good game with a theme and art that is very uninteresting to me. It is a worker placement game set in the Dungeons and Dragons universe. The game is fun and the ability to build different locations provides good variability. I enjoyed the game, but it is another worker placement that I would not want to play over other games. 

Maglev Metro – 6/10

I only played this once with 4 players so I don’t think my 6/10 is a fair rating, but I will re-evaluate once I play it more. The game we played was a total slog. The object of the game is to create routes, move passengers (robots?) from their spawn location to a space matching their color. The game had a lot of potential but as we built our engine, the game speed did not increase because more color robots are introduced which requires more engine building. The person who went 4th also seemed like they had no chance at all. I would like to try it again because the core game seemed very interesting.

The Maiden in the Forest – 6/10

Another Button Shy solo game, this one was interesting but a bit confusing for the first play. I need to try it more, I had only played it once, but it does seem like a puzzle that will have an obvious solution. You lay out cards in a circle, swap them based on their symbols and colors, and flip them if they match. 

Mapmaker: The Gerrymandering Game – 7.5/10

A very fun game about gerrymandering a map for you political party. The theme is mostly irrelevant in this one, you place wooden lines on the grid and try to close off sections on your turn, which then gives you control of that area. Whoever controls the most areas wins. This game is very good at 2 players and good at 3, I have not tried 4. It plays in less than 10 minutes and set-up takes less than 30 seconds.

Mazescape Labyrinthos – 6/10

This is basically just a maze, you try and work your way through the path, collecting treasures and finding the key, then you try and get to the end. It is more of an activity than a game, but it is fun,

Mind MGMT – 9/10

This game is excellent. One side controls “The Recruiter”, moving through the map on their own secret board and they collect recruits using the symbols on the board. The other side, the “Rogue Agents” are asking questions to The Recruiter and are trying to find the exact spot they are in at that moment. This is a hidden movement and deduction game. The most interesting part is the game includes packs called The Shift System that boost each side, so if one side is winning more often, you give them a pack and they have a new ability that makes them more powerful. So far in almost all my games the Rogue Agents have won, but in all of those except 1 the recruiter was 1 turn from winning. The art is offputting and distracting, but comes through once you understand the game. 

Modern Art – 9/10

Usually the people I play with like to move on to a different game after we play one, but every single person I played Modern Art with requested to play it again immediately after. This is a pure auction game where you are auction off and buying art. At the end of the round, the art is either worth something plus the value it gained in any previous round, or nothing. There is a deep level of strategy that you can discover in this game, but I also think this game could be played as a party game or in a casual setting. This is a very easy game to learn and takes about an hour to play.

My Shelfie – 5.5/10

This is a game about collecting pieces of different colored shelves and placing them in a Connect 4-like structure. The pieces fall to the bottom and you work your way up. It is unique in that way, but ultimately not very interesting. 

Mythic Mischief – 7/10

I think this game has the potential to rise in rating, but I have played it about 5 times so I am confident about my 7 for now. You play as students in a school of monsters, each with their own asymmetric abilities and movement. You are trying to avoid the Tomekeeper and you score when other players are captured by him. You can move other players into his path, and first to 10 or highest score wins. One issue is this game is outrageously expensive for what you get, at least the Gamefound crowdfunded prices, and fortunately a friend of mine picked it up. I also really dislike the art but that’s a subjective issue. The components are excellent and the gameplay is pretty good though, it is worth checking out. I also tried it at 3 players and it does work pretty well for the type of abstract game it is.

Nemesis – Unrated

I only played Nemesis once, but it was a great experience bogged down by constantly checking rules, and I did a lot of prep to try and learn this game. I know the next time I play the rules won’t be as big of an issue, so I don’t knock the game for that. It was a lot of fun, it is basically Alien the board game. We played the game in full co-op instead of the standard semi co-op, but next time we will try the other way. There is a lot of randomness and the game is really difficult, but the theme is strong and the components and miniatures are excellent quality. 

Nidavellir – 6.5/10

This game was a hit originally, I rated it an 8 and really enjoyed it. As we kept playing, I found it less and less engaging. The object of the game is to collect different scoring cards through bidding, and each scores based on different criteria. Each time you collect one of each or fill a row of them, you get a special scoring card. The game is fun and is very easy to learn and quick to play, but in my opinion it plays nearly the same every time. Even though you can specialize in a different scoring type, it still feels the same. This does not seem to be the general publics opinion though, so it is worth checking out if you haven’t played it. 

Oceans – 7/10

Evolution was one of the first games I purchased and played in my early board gaming days, and I still really enjoy it (I also rate it a 7/10). Oceans is very similar, you build sea creatures with different traits and try and live in the ecosystem with other player’s creatures. Oceans is significantly less brutal and mean, and it has more options in terms of building your creature. That said, I did not like the unique abilities as much as I thought I would; some seemed way stronger than others. The game is still very good though, I think I barely prefer Evolution still but I would play and enjoy either.

Paleo – Unrated

I only played Paleo once, but this co-op game really intrigued me. It is incredibly unique and the art is very good. You draw cards with different backs, and each back gives you a general idea of what is on the other side. Then you choose a card and flip it to resolve it. Sometimes you get attacked, sometimes you get rewards. It plays as if you were controlling cavemen through an adventure story, dealing with wild animals and dangerous terrain. I want to play this one more, I think it could end up being a favorite.

Pan Am – 7.5

I was not expecting much of this game, a game by Funko about the airline Pan Am. But it ended up being a very good game about setting up airlines and purchasing stocks. You build your route through a map while upgrading planes and purchasing stocks. There are event cards in the game that determine the price of the stock and if there are any special conditions. This strategy game is worth checking out, it is fun and surprising thinky and deep.

Pandemic Legacy Season 2 – 8.5

I do not like Pandemic. I generally like co-op games but Pandemic was not very fun for me and my group. We always found it very random yet too easy, and there was usually a correct answer for each turn rather than tight decision making. Pandemic is a beloved game though and I do respect it, I also do recommend it for anyone interested in starting the hobby. That said, we played all 3 Pandemic Legacy games in the order 0, 1, and 2. 0 was excellent, we did not like 1, and 2 was excellent. I know a lot of people say 2 can be very random and punishing but we never ran into that. The game was challenging without being impossible, and the mechanics introduced in the game that I won’t spoil were really fun to explore. 

Pandemic: Hot Zone – North America – 5/10

This is a little and quick version of Pandemic. It actually is a very nice package, and I would choose this version over the original. It is quicker and smaller/more portable. 

Paris La Cite de la Lumiere – 7.5

This is a very fun 2 player game. You build the base of a town by placing territory that belongs to you, your opponent, and neutral territory, then once it is all placed you build structures on your and neutral territory. It is quick, has good variability with special pieces that are selected randomly for each game, and looks very good.

Pictomania 2nd Edition – 5/10

This game is probably perfect for some people, but I didn’t find it that enjoyable. It is a party game where everyone simultaneously draws pictures, and then when you finish you try and guess other pictures. I don’t really like drawing games as much as other party games, but this game has a lot of fiddly parts and set up between rounds for how simple it is.

Pitchcar – 9/10

Pitchcar is so much fun. All you do is flick a disc shaped car around a track and try to be the first to complete however many laps you decide (I think the official rule is 2 but I am not sure). Building the track is as much fun as playing the game itself, but every time I play this we end up playing for hours. 

Point Salad – 8/10

The rules to this game can be explained in a few seconds; either take 2 vegetables or take a scoring card, scoring cards tell you how to score the vegetables and then you also can flip scoring cards once per turn to the vegetable on the other side. We play this game a lot (I even tracked down the Eevee version from Korea since the game is mostly language independent), and each game is about 10 minutes. It also plays well at any player count.

Project L – 7/10

This is a fun polyomino, engine building game where you collect shapes, fill cards that require the shapes, and then get more shapes. You win by collecting the most victory points, which are listed on some of the cards you complete. The components are very good, the game is simple to learn, and the box is very small for those who are light on space. It is pretty quick, about 20 minutes, and turns are fast so there is little downtime. This is a very good game for those looking for a quick, light game.

QE – 7/10

QE is a lot of fun, you bid any number (literally any number) to purchase discs that have a scoring value and a country listed. You get more points for collecting your matching country. Whoever spent the most money loses automatically, after that it comes down to victory points. It works very well actually, but after I played Modern Art, I didn’t feel the need to play this one again.

Quacks of Quedlinberg – 7.5/10

This game is just plain fun. It is a push your luck game where you draw tokens out of your personal bag until you either stop or bust by drawing too many of the starting white tokens. There are many different tokens you can purchase each game that have different abilities and conditions, and there are 4 different variants for each color token. It plays well at any player count because it is simultaneous. The game definitely leans much more on luck than strategy, but if you want a fun, light game this is perfect.

Race for the Galaxy – 7/10

This game packs a lot into a 20 minute experience. I already knew how to play Roll for the Galaxy so the symbology for me wasn’t a problem, but it is potentially overwhelming at first. You build an engine by playing different types of cards with different abilities, and each card in the game is unique. There are many different ways to win and score points. I liked the game, but I wouldn’t choose it over others that I have, so for me it is only a 7 but it really is a well designed game that is worth checking out.

Radlands – 7.5/10

This is a fun 2 player game where you are trying to destroy the other person’s 3 bases. You can protect your bases by putting people in front of them, and they each have abilities that usually affect your opponent. It plays a lot like a trading card game, but is entirely self-contained. I only played this a few times, but this one has a lot of promise and I think it will only get better once I start to learn the cards.

Ragemore – 6/10

Another solo Button Shy game. In this one you lead a group of knights and warriors to complete quests and defeat monsters. You win by defeating 3 monsters of 2 different symbols. It is fine, it plays quickly (5-10 minutes) and barely takes up any space, so it’s worth looking into if you need a decent, quick game that has a small footprint.

Revolver Noir – 6.5/10

A 2 player Button Shy game where you control an agent through a building and try to assassinate the opposing agent. You move through locations by taking a card and placing it at the top of your hand, which is hidden from the other player. You can interact with different rooms to get clues on where the other person may be, and if you can defeat them you win. It is a neat hidden movement game where both players are hidden, and plays in about 15 minutes. 

Riftforce – 6.5/10

This is a game similar to Air, Land, and Sea where you are battling for different lanes against another player, but for some reason this one wasn’t that exciting for me. The gimmick with this one is each player controls different factions with different abilities. I think this one will work for many people, but I prefer the other games of this type. It was still fun and I would play it more.","I played over 100 games new to me this year, here is a small write-up on most of them.

"I might get hate for this, but where I live, original copies of boardgames cost very high here which forces me to get counterfeit due to them being wayy less expensive, like if you want to buy an original copy of Pandemic here, it will cost you half of your salary as an average worker.

"Hey

We have a group of 9 for new years eve and Ready Set Bet is one of the games we were thinking of playing, but one player has the kind of rubbish job of rolling the dice. I'm trying to think of an alternative way that they can be involved.

What I'm considering is that the 9th player chooses 3 people and any money those players lose, goes to the house. They get to choose a person they get 3x money, another 2x and the third 1x . Their choice is made before the race and then after they reveal who they put for 3x ,2x and 1x and take the money they lost, according to the multiplier.

Does this sound like it would work and add an interesting game element for the 9th player?

"One of my absolute favorites that was ""new to me"" this year.

This game changed my opinion on how big a box had to be to still be a phenomenal game with just as much ""meat"" to it as almost any game in my collection.



Take a look at my thoughts below

 - while this is a ""Solo"" review there's still plenty about the gameplay - especially considering how close the Solo mode is to a multi-player game

(Also please note this was first fully formatted and with images on my blog, but I really wanted this group to hear my thoughts on this one, it's just such a gem)

THE REVIEW

Garphill games, first reaching a level of fame with their “North Sea” trilogy, they then moved onto their “West Kingdom” trilogy, it’s the 3rd entry into this trilogy we will be focusing on today.


The Story

It’s 980AD, the king has bankrupted the kingdom by desperately keeping peace, poverty spread..poverty breeds all sorts of insurgency and crime, this is where you come in.

You are a viscount in the west kingdom, you will travel the kingdom, building, creating manuscripts, acquiring land deeds and sending workers to the castle. Strive to cause either prosperity or poverty in the kingdom – whichever suits your schemes and strategy best!

Gameplay

So how does this translate to the gameplay?

You will travel the kingdom clockwise around a rondel – the outer track being used for building and buying/trading, the inner track being used for manuscripts and working the castle. Regardless of whether you are on the inner or outer track you will have the opportunity to improve your deck.

What does your deck do I hear you asking?

The deck is a genius little thing. You start of with the same 8 basic cards as everyone one else, and one additional card representing your character (you will choose this out of a few options at the beginning of the game, that will be paired with a starting location and various resources).

Each of these cards will have various icons on them effectively providing you with “free” resources for the time they remain in play (this will usually be 3 turns) aswell as many cards having abilities, some which trigger when played, some while in play, and some when leaving play.

In addition, the card you play for the turn also determines how many spaces you move on the board this turn.


So while you are traveling around partaking in this somewhat “point salad” of building, manuscripts and castle work. You will be triggering all sorts of bonuses from various spaces. Strengthing your deck to be more effective on your journeys around the board. Collecting resources to spend. And last but not least being aware of the see-saw that is your Virtue and Corruption.

This interesting track is one of the unique things in Viscounts, I would be doing a disservice not to mention it. The game end will trigger when poverty or prosperity is reached. What causes this to happens is a number of Deeds or Debts being gained between the players, now the main way this happens if from the Virture/Corruption track.

This track on your player board has two markers that start on opposing ends, and will trigger on the turn they meet. Virtuous actions move the right marker towards the left. Corrupt actions will move the left marker towards the right. The further left when a collision occurs, the more deeds you will gain, the further right, the more debts, but also silver you will gain.


A player board mid game – note the Virtue/Corruption track in the middle
Debts by default will lose you 2 VP at the end of the game, unless you manage to “flip” them, which gain you a resource of your choice.

Deeds on the other hand provide you 1 VP, or 3 if you manage to flip them.

So why would you ever want Debts? Well, many cards actually play quite well with Debts, and corrupt actions tend to be able to score you a few more points, or at the very least, provide more flexibility. And, more so. Remember how the end game is triggered by prosperity or poverty? Well, prosperity is triggered by using all the Deeds, but, will provide bonus VP to the player with the most flipped Debts, the reverse is true for poverty.

Like many “point-salad” games, focusing on one or two of the aspects is often a stronger and better strategy as points tends to snowball the more you focus on one category – however unlike many other games if this style, most focuses will trigger abilities to help other aspects of scoring, often making 2 focuses better than just one.

So…does it work?

So, despite all the different moving parts I can without hesitation say that Garphill Games have done an AMAZING job at making it all pull together seamlessly.

Something with this many moving parts can often feel like a disjointed amalgamation. However this comes together like a perfectly sewn fabric. Iconography connects things together, making it clear what flows and how the cards relate to the board and vise-versa.

Replayability

Between the myriad of starting characters, and how these are combined with different resource cards, aswell as the simple abundance of cards that you can purchase for your deck – let’s not forget, even the board sections are in a randomized order every game, a small but noticeable difference.

This game doesn’t tire. I’ve played 16 games in a relatively short time period. And every game still feels fresh. No small feet for someone who enjoys variation as much as I do.

Presentation

With “The Mico” providing his unique artwork, vibrant colors and a 3D castle in the centre of the board Viscounts is far from boring on the table.


The AI

I thought you said this was a solo review, why am I only hearing about solo now?

Don’t worry, I hear you. And trust me, I hate nothing more than reading a review and getting to this section simply to be told “Yeah sadly the solo let’s this one down, stick to multi-player” so don’t fret! The reason I’ve left it till the end, is simply because the solo mode really does play identically to the multi-player mode. The AI is simply masterful. Sure it plays by a different set of cards, it uses its own (but similar) board, well, one of four. Each with its own personality and focus. But, it still does everything you do. It collects resources, it spends them, it has a Virtue/Corruption track, there has to be space for it to build, it follows the rondel. It deck builds, albeit in a slightly more basic fashion. Very few games have captured this level of genuine realism in their solo bots.

Conclusion

Whether you’re an experienced Garphill pro, or a relative newbie (like me). If you’re a fan of either: juicy gameplay, deckbuilding, realistic AI, resource management or unique systems. Give this one a shot. Relatively inexpensive compared to many other games, and equally as crunchy and as gorgeous as the best of them. Viscounts deserves a place in most, if not all solo gamers reservoirs.

While this was my first Garphill purchase, it was not my last. This had me backing their solo-only kickstarter “Legacy of Yu” in a heartbeat, adding on Raiders of Scythia aswell, I’ve also recently added Circadians: First Light to my collection also.

"Hey everyone!  


I saw a thread earlier talking about the worst homebrew rules, but a lot of the time some good homebrew stuff can be really interesting. I'm always on the lookout for ways to mix things up or interesting house rules, so I thought I'd ask; what are your favourite homebrew rules / house rules?  


I have three examples:  


One is an easy twist to **Tapestry**, where you draw two Tapestry cards and choose one to keep instead of drawing one. We feel that Tapestry cards are so swingy, but also the most exciting part of the game. If you end up just drawing Traps / Olympic Games / World Fair all day while someone else draws more exciting ones, it can really ruin the game (both in terms of balance and excitement). We've really enjoyed this variant.  


A more complex one I have is for **Canvas**. I call it ""The Grand Reveal"". In the expansion, you get to vote on whose piece is the best at the end of the game and they also win the game. However, because you can track who is making what, I feel it makes the choice a little less objective. In the variant I propose, you don't score your paintings during the game, and instead turn them facedown when they are done. This way, you secretly submit a painting for voting on for actual painting quality, and then you just vote on one that isn't your own. This also has the added advantage of you not scoring during the game, making it less obvious who is winning.  


The final one is for my second favourite game **New Angeles.** This is just a short ""variant"" I propose as an intro version, but can be used for a ""quick game"" as well. Set Threat to 7 and play only 2 rounds instead of 3. If you want to go further, I'd say that cards that ""Exhaust to do X"" or ""Do X at the end of your turn"" should only appear in the first quarter of the game (basically, until the first threat card is revealed). This way, you guarantee that more impactful rewards appear later in the game.",What is your favourite homebrew rule?,1,self.boardgames,zy1g0w,JustAModestMan,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/zy1g0w/what_is_your_favourite_homebrew_rule/,1672307176
"I think I watched a playthrough of this game on the Before You Play youtube channel  (there is a small chance it could be on the Watch it played channel instead by the same people). I searched and searched but couldn't remember what the game is called.  


Its a science fiction themed Tetris tile placement game where each player has their own board covered by different types of rocks/materials. You get points at the end of the game based on how many of each type of material is still uncovered (if you cover up everything you get max points). 

Each round the players choose a crew member card from their hand to play, which has an initiative score. Then the cards are revealed simultaneously and the lowest initiative goes first. Each card has a gather resources ability and/or a build phase ability. After you gather resources in the day, you can spend resources to build at night, and building is how you place the Tetris pieces on your board.  


After you play a card, you hand over your cards to the other player, so in a 2 player game each player only has 1/2 the deck available to them on a given turn.

"So this is a direct copy paste from a boardgamegeek post made at midnight I wounder if the people here have thoughts, recomendations, or help with this?

Why my brain ended up here feel free to skip:
I like a lot of what Mercurial offers but my group is pretty much co-op exclusive and not the biggest fans of count the point games so while debating getting this game I came up with this mode idea and wondered if it could work, sounds like fun, and if anyone else had thoughts on a more beat the objective style co-op mode.

The actually thing:
So I thought I'd share and get the opinions from the BGG community(maybe even a creator of I'm lucky). I'm very open to feedback and hearing if anyone that's played thinks this could work, has major flaws, or if you think it would be fun.
Apologies if I get any lingo or terms wrong.
The basics:
Start with a number of heroics face down based off of the number of players and chosen difficulty. I'm thinking base 10 for a 4 player game.(this number is very rough)

Buy from anywhere in the line no ""incentive"".

At the end of every round discard from both lines far left equal to the number of face up heroic cards.
Then flip a heroic face up.

When you're out of spell cards you lose, when all heroics are collected you win.

More thoughts:

I think VP/renown tokens should become a discard to use free re roll my gut says of 2 dice

Myst is mysterious and cool 12 myst from an equilibrium can claim a face down heroic

Arcana just stay with you if you earn one and could give an ""as many dice as you want"" reroll if you put their ""what would normally give a bonus"" under them from your spell discard kinda like feeding a familiar(maybe also put a number out equal to player count or something?)

The put a spell on the bottom gain an gem action could now do a spell and a converter of choice to top or bottom (letting you potentially ""save"" something from being discarded in a round)

The basic story idea:
Kinda of ""the kingdom is in trouble we don't know all of what's happening yet but you spell casters should probably do some magic about it or we'll all die"" using the prestige/vp as rerolls was kind of like calling in support form the people/kingdom in my mind, the myst so versatile and mysterious able to solve problems before they fully emerge, and the arcana being like attracting familiars or spirit allies etc. I thought there was a lot of fun thematic tie in. Losing when you run out options but things are still going wrong, and obviously I was heavily inspired by the solo play rules.

"Was at Barnes and Nobles and the faux book design of the games caught my eye, and upon reading all 4 of the themes and styles of gameplay I thought they were great! I bought two (Tortuga and Bristol), went home, read the rules, and IMMEDIATELY went out and bought the other 2! (Deadwood and Salem). All 4 are absolutely fantastic. My group loves social deduction and coop games, and these offer a little bit of both while accommodating those who don't like that genre

Deadwood is the least about social deduction but has lots of forced cooperation, with a backstabbing round in the end (forced but uneasy cooperation is best cooperation)

Salem is straight up social deduction but with card management and a fun theme

"Was at Barnes and Nobles and the faux book design of the games caught my eye, and upon reading all 4 of the themes and styles of gameplay I thought they were great! I bought two (Tortuga and Bristol), went home, read the rules, and IMMEDIATELY went out and bought the other 2! (Deadwood and Salem). All 4 are absolutely fantastic. My group loves social deduction and coop games, and these offer a little bit of both while accommodating those who don't like that genre

Deadwood is the least about social deduction but has lots of forced cooperation, with a backstabbing round in the end (forced but uneasy cooperation is best cooperation)

Salem is straight up social deduction but with card management and a fun theme

"I wanted to ask this question because over the holidays I was visiting my wife's family and her mum has a special house rule/misreading of the rules about patchwork. Instead of just getting buttons and moving infront of the other player as a move she takes buttons for every space she moves(e.g. buys a tile with 3 moves and 1 button cost, instead of paying 1 button she gains 2).

"I’m a novice gamer. Most of my experience is in mainstream board games that have fairly straightforward/simple rules. Santa brought me Cubitos and I’m really enjoying it, but I’m still a little thrown off by the simultaneous play mechanics this game offers. 

I guess my question is, how do you play?

I’m not looking for a basic walk through, or the rules. Those are all over and I think I have a solid understanding of the basic mechanics of the game. What I’m looking for is an answer to what it looks like when your group plays Cubitos.

I’ve looked for videos of groups playing, but I can’t seem to find anything other than generic overviews or really detailed walk throughs. Those are great but the directions discuss simultaneous play and I can’t seem to wrap my head around what that looks like. 

We’ve tried a couple of different things. When we first started, as a group we watched as each player rolled their turn and then when it moved to the Run phase we went player to player to resolve all of our dice one at a time.  

Wanting to try the more simultaneous style, but not quite confident that we had the strongest grasp of everything, we’ve graduated to rolling on our own and then coming together to narrate each turn as we resolve the dice. 

It just feels like we aren’t playing right. Don’t get me wrong, overall we are having fun with it, which is all that matters, but I’d love to hear how other players enjoy the game. I’m also open to links if anyone has an example of a  video of gamers playing without spelling out every step and just playing.",How do YOU play Cubitos?,1,self.boardgames,zxw0ms,Imagettingrim,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/zxw0ms/how_do_you_play_cubitos/,1672289142

"I wanted to get people’s opinions on how a co op board game should handle the balance between time pressure and open worlds. As well as any examples one might have of a game that does this well!

What I mean: In competitive board games (even open world games) there is an easy inherit time pressure as if you don’t optimize turns, you will lose. In co-op (especially campaign style) this isn’t as straightforward as the game must handle adding pressure to make you use turns in a meaningful way. 

The downside of this pressure in many large games is that it limits players ability to explore the world (I. E you don’t go where you want to because you don’t have time). How should a co op game balance these two? 

Some examples: 7th continent uses the draw deck to ensure you use turns wisely. Technically it’s an open world but exploring it too freely can lead to a loss. Games like eldritch horror (though maybe not open world) use increasing difficult and turn limits",Time pressure vs. open world in co-op games,1,self.boardgames,zxvow2,Boardgame-life,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/zxvow2/time_pressure_vs_open_world_in_coop_games/,1672288210

"I'm sure this has been posted somewhere before but couldn't find it with a quick keyword search, so I apologize if this is a duplicate!

I don't have a reliable local gaming group, but have friends across the country that are into physical board games. I've tried solutions like Tabletop Simulator and Tabletopia to keep in touch with them, but in general they'd found the interfaces too ""fiddly"" and prefer to look at/interact with a physical copy of the game.

I've searched around for solutions for being able to set up a physical copy of a board game and play it remotely with others, but haven't landed on what seems to be an agreed upon solution. The best I've seen is people setting up webcams on tripods pointing down at the game from above with one person maintaining the game state, but it begs the question of how to handle individual  hands of cards and things like secrecy etc.

I suspect one could make a bespoke solution for each game, but has anyone run across a general system or structure that works for them?

I was thinking about combining the webcam solution for the board with something like TTS or Tabletopia to simply run the hands of cards from a shared deck virtually but since I don't think either include webcam functionality that'd mean people running multiple programs at the same time and not feel very seemless.

Anyone else have any other thoughts or idea or run across alternative platforms?

"It was the end of the game, and I had some hero cards I had been saving and wanted to use them for the points they gave. One of them was the ""Form an unlikely alliance"" card. I had two of them and attempted to play it twice on the same person for the points. Both people I was playing against argued heavily against the use of the card because they felt it should be illegal to play if it provides no additional effect. In their eyes, the alliance had already been formed and I had the use of my ally's runes, so I should not be able to play it again. However, in my eyes, having no additional effect should not have bearing on whether the card can be played or not. Just because it has no additional benefit to me (aside from the point it rewards) should not prevent the usage... it just means nothing happens from me doing so.

"Before 2022, I have played a handful of games and just barely getting into the hobby.  Some of my favorites were Pandemic, Azul, Villainous, Citadels, Harry Potter Hogwarts Battle and Lost Cities. 

I didnt have many friends who I could reliably get a gaming night together with so I didn't want to buy a ton of games and never play them.  My wife sometimes enjoys playing but it's always me who initiates it, and I know she wouldn't be into certain genres/weights, I held off buying certain ones.  Until this year when I finally had people to play with on a semi regular basis. I also discovered BoardGameArena and man that is exactly what I needed!! I will include those in here as well. And for all games, I won't include if I played it only once unless it REALLY stuck with me.  This is purely alphabetical order. 


**7 Wonders**: I enjoy playing it as a light game but I don't feel I would ever choose it. I know there's a few different strategies but it always felt like whoever went full science won or was right near the top.  I agree it's a good gateway game. 

**7 Wonders Duel**: I like this one very much.  The game is very quick but still requires a good amount of thought and planning. You have to develop a strategy quickly while also checking on your opponent, so you may need to essentially hate draft, or even DELAY draft.  I just made up the term lol when you want a certain card flipped/chosen but you need THEM to do it. 

**7 Wonders Architects**: It's alright. Sometimes you feel the game plays itself. You know you need a Stone for example so you grab on to the left or right, if not then from the center. And otherwise, personally, I grab a science token instead of just points.  Its fine when I want to just barely think for 15 minutes on BGA. 

**The Castles of Burgundy**: Once I played one full game of it and I grasped what I was really supposed to be doing strategy-wise, I fell in love with it.  I had held off at first because ""it's a dice game."" But you always have so many options it's not about rng. I'm not amazing at the game, my average score is 182 and my high is 202. I actually haven't won a game of it yet but I am still enjoying it and every game I pick up something new.  I'm sure I wasn't the only one to go full Animals at the beginning because it's easy? 

**Chocolate Factory**: I've only played this on BGA turn-based and I wouldn't play it live because I want to be able to think and plan out a shift while being able to undo, feeling out your factory parts.   Still working on what pieces should go where, I don't often have a very well run machine, but enjoying the game nonetheless. 

**Dice Hospital**: For the same reasons as Chocolate Factory, I'd only want to play it turn-based.  I was very wary to try out a dice game, but glad the game is about manipulating them in very strategic ways and optimizing each round.  I'll submit my round and then think about what could have been done to squeeze another healed dice. 

**Everdell**: The most recent game I've purchased and have about 8 plays of it. (I don't keep track of live plays of games).  Very much enjoying it, and maybe because I'm still pretty new but no cards seem entirely worthless? Which is good because sometimes you want to house-rule a few cards out of a game that no one likes.   There's a lot of combos to like, and the random forest locations can determine what strategy you may initially take. But if I had one complaint it would be maybe that there's too many cards.  Some combos you may literally not even see come out together over a few games.  I literally never saw the Dungeon the first two plays. 
Oh, and adorable as heck artwork on everything!

**Funkoverse**: I have Harry Potter and a DC one.  I was very excited to try this after watching videos and How To's.  But I realized I just don't really enjoy arena brawler type games. I'm glad I didn't buy like 10 sets before getting into it.  I'll play if someone asks but I won't ever choose this myself.

**Great Western Trail**: Took me a while to figure out the rules from reading them and watching How To's, and like CoB it took a whole game to really know what I'm SUPPOSED to be doing.  I've only two plays, and both were very different playstyles but I can't wait to get into it again. It seems there's a lot of strategies and ways to approach everything.  But also so many ways to get points, end game scoring is a lot. 

**Hive**: It's like chess with a moving board, meaning the ""center"" can change each turn, or where the Queen is.  I like that aspect of it.  Just thinky enough to make it interesting. 

**Imhotep**: I was not expecting this to be as cutthroat as it turned out to be.  I KNEW going in you could sail any boat at any time, and once I jumped in my first game I was using that to screw over my opponent all the time.  And them on me, of course. This will cause fights in real life with certain players lol.  And I know it's an abscract strategy game but I'm not a fan of the look.  It's too bland with the gray and black blocks.  In comparison, Azul is a beautiful abstract. 

**Jaipur**: An excellent, and quick, card game of drafting and set collection, which you sell those sets immediately for points.  You have to pay attention to what your opponent has been taking, or just sold, so that you can time your moves effectively.  A great &lt;30 minute game. 

**Kingdomino**: A bit too simple of a game for my tastes.  Another I won't pick, but if it's chosen by another it's still solid enough.  

**Patchwork**: A very fun two player only game if you don't want any direct interaction.  There's a race to complete a 7x7 first, as well as trying to fill in your grid 100% and it will be tough at the end.  And also weighing the option for each piece - how many spaces it has, how many buttons it has, and how much time it uses up.  Great game.  

**Point Salad**: When you need a fun, slightly thinky light game, this is a good one.  After my first game I thought it was too simple, but after a few you see there's more to it and the ways to maximize points, such as turning a point card into a vegetable when the point card got worse because of recent drafted vegetables. 

**Santorini**: What's the consensus on this for vanilla, or with powers? I think I like vanilla more.  Anyway, this definitely has a chess like feel where every move matters greatly and constantly trying to out think each other. And with the short play time, you can easily get a bunch of games in quickly. 

**Stone Age**: I thought I would HATE this because of rolling dice to get resources.  I want to k ow how many I'm getting, not leaving it up to chance.  But you can mitigate it with tools or placing more workers there. But it's not just about mitigating it, because choosing to gain more workers or tools is another in-game decision you'd have to consider, over different options.  Yes, I just described Worker Placement lol but the way you can get around the randomness of the dice rolls is built into it and I like that.  I've only played 4 games and lost them all but my scores keep going up as I learn so I'll keep at it!

**Viticulture**: I love the game despite some noticeable flaws.  First is the residual payments. Once you get late game, gaining £5 per turn isn't that big of a deal unless you're using visitor cards for points. So it's a good idea to at least get £1 or 2 relatively early if possible because money is often tight at first depending on your Ma and Pa cards. Second is the visitor cards can be a bit swingy.  I once used 3 in the final season (1 summer and 2 winter) and they combined to give me 10 points, and along with the 6 from a submitted order I had 16 in one year.  So is it that they're too powerful or I just used them to my advantage correctly? 
I do enjoy the game very much, though.  And like other WP games there's always tension with everyone vying for the popular spots. It's almost puzzly--""How can I get X done despite THAT spot being taken up?""

**Wingspan**: Fun engine builder. Beautiful artwork. I hate using the Draw 2 Bonus Card birds because you don't know what you're gonna get.  And the In Between Turn birds, I wouldn't play past round 1 or early 2 because otherwise it won't happen often, and I hardly use them anyway. In Round 4 I'm often mental mathing how much each row is worth to activate and how to score the most points, but I'm guessing that's the whole idea, right? Lol the game does seem to just have a sudden end, though.","My New-To-Me 2022 Game Reviews, my first year really getting into the hobby.",1,self.boardgames,zxquj5,alienfreaks04,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/zxquj5/my_newtome_2022_game_reviews_my_first_year_really/,1672275377

"There was a great discussion in the comments of another thread about how board games put us in stressful/competitive situations and sometimes test our relationships or hit just the right emotional wound to bring out the worst in us.

So I was wondering, what games do this the most for you? Are there any games you won't play with family/a specific group etc.? 

For me the answer is **Captain Sonar**. I love this game. But when I play it with family, something about the fact that the game is played in realtime adds so much to that feeling of time pressure and they basically start yelling at each other whenever there's a misunderstanding because they get so stressed out. Weirdly enough, my family all tend to be gracious losers in competitive games, but as soon as they're stressed under time pressure and ""you're not listening to me"" all hell breaks loose.
So yeah, a favourite game for me, but not one I play with my family anymore.

"This is just a PSA for those who tend to get annoyed or upset at family and friends who are not board gamers and are playing these new games mostly because you brought them over. 

You must remember that they are unaware of any unspoken rule or etiquette when rules are being taught such as not looking at your phone, eating Cheetos, or not handling your cards as if they were priceless relics. 

You must remember to curb your expectations such as the expectation that they will come prepared to know the rules of the game by watching some YouTube video. 

You must be patient when they have done all that and still don’t know the rules well. These games are complicated and even simple games can be overwhelming so please be patient. 

I say all this as someone new to the hobby but I’m getting to the place where I can say I’m pretty serious now about it too. Back then, it was the strange when people asked me to do all this “homework” before coming over. I found it terribly restricting when I was asked not to do this or that when sitting at the table. 

At that time, I didn’t care about their hobby, but now that I do, I understand where these ideas and feeling come from.

* One player was the antagonist, who was trying to collect things on the map. I think the other players couldn't ""see"" where the antagonist was, but had abilities that would help triangulate where he was. and then somehow stop him

"A few themes arising in today's r/boardgames threads got me thinking. In Azul-related threads, there are discussions around keeping the interaction more indirect vs. directly attacking an opponent, and whether to play more gently with weaker players. And then there's a thread about trash talk. 

I'm not trying to re-litigate those discussions or asking about your preferences on any of those things.

IMO these are generally just matters of personal preference and (the odd toxic situation aside) no preference is inherently better than another.

I suspect the problems come when people start with differing preferences or expectations, but don't communicate about those differences or don't negotiate a way of playing that everyone is ok with.

So here's my question: given that people don't always start with the same expectations, don't find the exact same things enjoyable, and differ in what they're happy to compromise on, do you do have any conversations before/after your games sessions to try to bring everyone onto the same page and make the gaming more enjoyable for everyone?

"Hi everyone

I own Clank! the base game and I was thinking of adding more variety in the game. 
As such I was thinking of getting all the base game expansions. (Sunken Treasures, Ape Lords, Gold and Silk, Mummy's Curse). 

However I noticed that for the same amount of money I could get Catacombs, which would theoretically offer unlimited variety...

I have some concerns though...
Base expansions don't just add path variety but also different mechanisms as well (water, mummies, locking paths etc). Also they are way more thematic and pleasing in their presentation. I find the tiles in Catacombs way blander and doesn't give me the impression that I am delving into a dungeon. While e.g. the Mummy turns sideways into a pyramid.

All in all, with the base game + expansions I would have 10 boards. But all seem unique in a way. On the other side with Catacombs I would have unlimited, but I am not sure how much of a difference they make.

I know Catacombs will also get its own expansions down the way, but I cannot be sure what these expansions will be or whether I will like them.

However, my friends didn't count it because in the middle of my route there are two stations that my opponents put since one of the paths I took blocked his.

Question: Do enemy Train Stations affect or ""cut"" my longest route bonus? (Given that I have a single unblocked line of trains, but there are two Train Stations my enemy put in two cities where my trains are)

"All UK (and probably Swiss) residents should be aware that Holy Grail Games (HGG) are currently trying to push VAT charges arising from kickstarting Rallyman Dirt onto backers.   

The facts:

The Rallyman Kickstarter had the following on the campaign page:

""""Friendly Shipping"" means that you'll pay no import tax in Europe, the US &amp; Canada. Please note that you may be liable for import duties for other destinations.""

The Kickstarter ran in July 2020 and at that point, the UK was in a transition period to 31 December 2020 from leaving the EU.  That meant, it was difficult to know exactly how VAT would work.

In March / April 2022, HGG ran the Encyclopedia kickstarter which stated the following on it’s campaign page (NB this is after the transition period) (NB not my emphasis):

“Sales tax

As this subject has come up in many recent campaigns, we would like clarify that a supporter of one of our projects **never has and never will need to pay any sales tax** on their pledges.

HGG handles all of this on our side of things and you do not need to expect to see any additional charges being added to your pledge or shipping prices later on.”

That information was also included on at least one other kickstarter campaign - Copan: Dying City.

On 21 December 2022, all-in backers started receiving emails from DHL requesting payment of Import Duty / Tax Payment of circa £51.75 (the amount may vary slightly depending on exchange rates and of course the value of the pledge) (NB this is VAT and not import duty).

UK backers immediately posted on the comments page of the Kickstarter about this and asked HGG to look into, respond and resolve.

The following day (22 December), HGG responded in their update #62 as follows:

“UK import taxes

For our UK backers, please note that this campaign has never been considered ""UK friendly"". Whilst it is written Europe in the shipping section, this is due to a translation error and was meant to refer to the E.U., hence why there is the « E.U. Friendly » shipping sticker on the shipping table. We sincerely apologize for the confusion. Whilst we cannot pay these fees for you, should the inclusion of these fees change your mind about pledging then please feel free to refuse the parcel. It will be returned to us and we will refund you your pledge. Thank you for your understanding.”

I will leave the reader to interpret the rights and wrongs of the above.  Since then, UK backers in this position have either had to pay the fees or have told DHL to hold the package pending resolution of this issue.

The following points are not facts but assumptions or outstanding matters that the affected UK backers feel HGG need to address urgently:

Under EU / UK VAT rules goods with a value of under £135 (inc shipping) should have UK VAT charged.  Since HGG’s price to EU backers and UK backers of pledges under £135 is the same and, the price to EU backers must, by law, include VAT, either, HGG have charged UK VAT correctly or have incorrectly charged French (or EU) VAT to UK backers.

Under EU / UK VAT rules, HGG must not charge any EU VAT to UK backers for goods in excess of £135 (including shipping) so that the UK can collect UK VAT on import or HGG can arrange to prepay UK VAT on export on behalf of the UK backers.  Since the pledge levels were the same prices for the UK and EU backers and the same separate prices if you pledged for one of the base games, then either HGG have charged French VAT (incorrectly) to UK backers or UK backers have paid a higher pre-Vat price compared to EU backers.  This likely means UK backers are being asked to pay French VAT and UK VAT at a combined rate of 44% (and should provide HGG with funds they can use to pay most of the import charges being levied now).

Given the facts stated earlier, my view is that HGG should pay for the UK VAT on import charges on behalf of each backer or offer to refund UK backers in full.  At present, HGG’s update 62 includes the phrase “we will refund you your pledge”.  It is not clear to UK backers what this means, so it could be:

• A refund of the KS pledge plus shipping fee adjusting for any For-ex charges incurred on the purchase; or

• A refund of the KS pledge plus shipping fee in Euros so that UK backers suffer for-ex fees on the way in and the way out; or

• A refund of the KS pledge in Euros but no refund of the shipping cost; or

• A refund of the pledge less KS fees (10% I believe); or

• A refund of the pledge less KS fees and PM fees.

Note that, even if HGG refund the pledge and shipping fees, they will have had the use of backers monies for nearly 30 months or at least 20 months for those backing in the PM.

The purpose of this post is to highlight HGG’s position on VAT in respect of UK backers.  Unless, HGG change their stance or their procedures, I strongly recommend UK backers to fully consider the cost of any KS pledges made on HGG’s games.  If you pledge more than £135 including shipping then expect to pay additional UK VAT on import; the amount is around 20% of total cost plus circa £10.50 (an admin fee).  It also seems likely that HGG are charging UK backers French VAT or a higher price on their webstore.  Whilst their webstore terms and conditions do point out that the recipient is responsible for import VAT, they do not lower their prices to account for the VAT they should not be charging.  There is a longer thread on BGG which looks at this and other issues around HGG which I would invite gamers to read:

"My wife and I have recently gotten into playing board games and are currently having a lot of fun with Disney Villainous. I noticed that I instinctually announced my moves in the game and started doing so for other games, like Root.

So say while playing Villainous, we'll say, ""I will move to X spot, grab 3 power, discard 2 cards, play a card paying 2 power to play it which allows me to do X, and then I'll end my turn and draw to 4 cards.""

I don't know why, but we have more fun when my wife and I essentially announce our moves. I don't know, I guess I feel more engaged with the other players while doing so. Anyways, I noticed others will play silently instead which makes it a bit harder to follow especially if they are playing a character/faction/etc. that I'm not familiar with, but really not a big deal. A few times, though, I have been caught completely unaware when someone wins seemingly out of nowhere because they played silently.

I admit I feel a bit disappointed when this happens because I feel like I have no idea what just happened in the game, or how, and it's already over. So my question is, is it common to announce moves? Or is it just sort of expected that, over time, each player will gain a better understanding of all the characters/factions/etc. involved?

"Hello,

I recently came back from a long and great night of board gaming, trying out all different kinds of new games we received for christmas. The group I played with is pretty cool. We try out all kinds of games from midweight stuff like Everdell or Quacks to colossi like On Mars or The Great Wall. I'm always glad to meet up and play.

However, the moment the games begin, some members of the group transform into trash talking demons. And I don't mean like light banter à la ""ooohhh you're going to get it this turn"" but like actual hostile, insulting stuff. I've also seen a thread on here a while ago where many commenters mentioned that trash talking is very common. This got me thinking: What role does it play in your groups? Is it an essential part of the vibe or an unnecessary gatekeep?

I'll come right out and say it: I hate it. I think trash talking is completely dumb. It's pointless at best and downright toxic at worst. It will prolong play times because people will be overthinking themselves in fear of getting ridiculed when making a suboptimal play. It will potentially destroy the mood. And worst of all, it will remove the fun out of any game. What on earth does anyone have to gain from it? Does trash talking ever enrich a play experience? I can't imagine that it does but at the same time I wonder why it is allegedly so common.

Now, I'd like to add that I'm 100% sure there is no malice in the trash talk in my group. Once the games are done, everyone switches back to normal so fast it's almost uncanny. Still, eventhough I know that, my caveman brain is simply not able to look past it and pretend it didn't happen. Like, I've played a lot of league of legends back in the day and I'm used to some horrible shit. But there it was easy because it's online and after the game I'd forgotten about it mostly. Not so in person to person board gaming.

So please r/boardgames, tell me your stories. In either direction. Don't be afraid to speak freely. If you think I need to grow a pair, no need to sugar coat it. If you have had similar experiences, do tell. I'd love to hear it.

The punch board was still Unpunched and since we played the base game, it remained unpunched. When I got home I decided to go ahead and punch out everything, and I discovered I was missing one of the weather chits! Now I can’t stop thinking about how I will deal with the issue if we do play again and happen to use the weather option. Any advice on how you handle missing pieces in a game? I’m sure my OCD will eventually calm down, but I’m not sure what the best method is for dealing with the lost piece, since it changes the odds of drawing weather effects.

"Race for the Galaxy is one of my all time favorite games and also one of the favorites of one of my other good friends in the gaming group.  In fact it has become a bit of a trope because if we can't figure out what to play in the group (usually 7-10 people), she and I can always agree on Race.  The only problem is that we've gotten quite good at this game and most other players laughingly pass to lose to one of the two of us.  

Last night I brought a new friend to gaming.   He has been coming for the last couple of months, and is quite good at games, but new to board games (mostly video games, MtG, and D&amp;D).  He is very friendly and happy to try anything new.  So when I jokingly suggested that he come play Race for the Galaxy with me and the other titan he smilingly accepted.  So the three of us (2 Galaxy gods made flesh and one new born babe) sat down, we taught him the game and the first game commenced.  He was absolutely crushed in points.  But the new boy is a great sport and was down for another game.    


He gets New Sparta.

He gets Improved Logistics.

He proceeds to pancake the two of us, steal our godhoods, and break our crowns over his muscled knee.  


All three of us were giddy with joy at the fun and the upset.  And the beauty of this is because each game can be so in depth, but only 30-45 minutes long we could reshuffle and go again.

"Hi again! I am not sure if my GT is the 2021 edition or just the normal second edition, anyway I have some questions that are not very clear for me:

**1)** If a **small meteor** its the front part of a **gun** (in english I think you call it barrel) is that like a **smooth part**? I mean, will it bounce or destroy the gun?

**2)** Similary, if a **small meteor** **coming from the side** is ""aiming"" to the (for example) 7th row and I have a gun in the 6th row pointed to that direction, **the gun will destroy the meteor**? I know that for big meteors thats the case, but not sure if small ones can be destroyed exactly like the big ones.

**3)** I am not playing now with **Rough Roads**, but I gave a look to it and I dont understand something: the cards **are adventurous cards**? I saw just one card saying that if something explodes on your ship, the 8 squares around it will explode too. Well, thats not an adventurous card because if you just apply that card, there is nothing to cause the explosion. So I wonder if you play one Rough Road card everytime you draw an adventurous card, or perhaps one per game....I dont know, rules were not specific :(

**4)** Finally, if you play the Transgalactice Trek, the best-looking ship award disapears completly from all the 3 rounds, right?

My family and I have been playing a variety of board games over the holidays, and Game of Life has stuck with us.

"Hey everyone! My wife and I are looking at getting a vaulted board game/dining table as our current situation, playing on our small kitchen bar, is getting less and less enjoyable. We don’t have a dining table due to space reasons, but we are upgrading into a bigger apartment within the next year with a lot more room and this is something we have been looking into the past few days, but I wanted to get a little bit of insight from people who have more experience in this area than us to see what would work best and if it’s worth saving for. I’ll give a little bit of background info now on what our situation is and see if that helps.

We’ve been playing board games for a few years now, at least 3 but probably more like 4. We have a collection of 35 games of varying complexity, from simple card games like Love Letter all the way up to complex games with lot of components/space requirements like Ark Nova. Our friends that we have board games night with very frequently also have a collection of 50+ games that are the same levels of complexity too and when we host, that bar gets super full with all the pieces, drinks and snacks and we’ve had a couple instances of spillage on cards because of that. 

We don’t live in a country that some table manufacturers can ship to such as Wyrmwood, so we have to commission one from a local woodworker, and the table we are looking at is the one posted by The Wood Whisperer on YouTube, since it comes with very detailed plans and videos on how he does it all, so that way whoever we hire is able to make it as close to that one as possible. 

My main questions are:

1: Is it nice to play in a vaulted surface? We think it looks really nice to have the leaves on the table that aren’t being used by the board game to have drinks and stuff on, but we also like the cup holder attachment things on the sides.

2: I DM for D&amp;D, is it nice to play D&amp;D on one of these tables?

3: Does the cost outweigh the actual enjoyment of using the table or is it one of those things where after a while, you regret buying it?

"I recently identified a game mechanic that really interests me, but I'm struggling to find other games that utilize it.

The mechanic in question is from GMT's ""Comancheria"". Each turn, the player chooses one of 4 'operations', each of which involves several steps of instructions to follow. For example, the most important operation ('Passage of Time') has 15 individual steps, with several bullet points and conditional statements nested within the steps. These operations are in no way limited to influencing an isolated system or layer of the game. Each operation influences the common board state, player resources, AI procedures, event cards, etc. differently than the others may.

Generally, I find it fascinating, and I want to find other games that use a similar system of procedures or 'clustered' actions.

*Bocchi the Rock* also had a scene (which I think might have been partly live-action I can't remember exactly) where she turns into a piece and pulls a card.

The newest episode of *Urusei Yatsura* also had a brief scene where characters were playing a more distinctly Japanese-themed version but it indeed had them reading off a shitty life-event that happens to the characters and using it to determine a weird punishment.

"There's been a lot of pretty good games released this year that have made some noise - Carnegie, Endless Winter, Dead Reckoning, Revive, and even the big one itself, Frosthaven. But let me tell you, none of these games hold a candle to the elegant brilliance of none other than **Sniper Elite: The Board Game.**

Does that sound weird? I know it did to me when I first saw it. Even though 'IP Games' have are not the insta-trash they used to be in times past, this game just *seems* like it's going to be bad. I can't even explain why I tried it. It was a complete whim of a purchase. But it has ended up becoming the best board game purchase I made this year. I have never played the video game series this board game is apparently based on, but that does not take anything away from the game itself.

Some gameplay basics for those who haven't experienced the brilliance yet: the game plays from 2-4. One player is the titular sniper. That player must complete 2 objectives (reach 2 spaces on the board that are secretly chosen before the game), and has 10 moves to do so for each objective.  This is a hidden movement game. The sniper moves by marking their movements on a minimap kept hidden from the other players. He can take shots at the defenders, and it is so fun to just say 'I'm taking a shot,' shooting (which is done through a chit pull mechanic), and if you succeed, just handing over the mini to your opponent. They have no idea where the shot came from, but they might be able to deduce some information based on how many chits you pulled from the bag. It's brilliant! Everything the sniper does is about staying hidden, but you have to give information at some point in order to complete objectives on time. But misdirection can also play a big part in going towards a victory.

The other 1-3 players control the defenders - 9 units spread throughout the map. Their job is to find the sniper, and attack him twice to kill him, or just delay him enough that the clock runs out. Playing the defenders is a blast! At least for me, because I do love me some deduction games, and this is such good deduction. You always have a little bit of information to go on, and you can just narrow it down and narrow it down. And the defenders are juuuuust not powerful enough to overtake the sniper if they find him UNLESS they have planned their moves smart enough and are in good position.

Both players have special powers they can use that can change each game. And hey, you know how line of sight is such a bitch to teach in most games? Not here! It's really easy. You can shoot if you can draw a straight line, but you can't shoot *through* a different kind of space. The key word is through. Into and out of, okay. But through being a rule of thumb is so simple it makes you wonder why it hasn't been done before. Okay, maybe it has. I'm not aware of every game's line of sight rules, but I can't think of another one off the top of my head. Anyway, the brilliant David Thompson, who has been on absolute fire with his designs (seriously, does this guy ever miss?) is the mastermind behind these rules that gel so well.

The set up is less than a minute. Map. Cubes. Tokens in bag. Minis on board. Choose your cards. Done. The game is so simple, but the tension is so high. I was playing last night, just staring at the board, and studying, trying to really read my opponent, and you start thinking, 'This game should be a sport.' Seriously, the organizers at the WBC need to seriously consider adding this one as a staple.

"I first played terraforming mars a while ago and had always wanted to get the game for myself. With the barnes and noble sale going on, I was so excited to finally get the game. I got off work, went, got the game, and all seemed well until I got home and realized I got the Ares version and that there was a difference between that and the original that I played. 

I got a pretty good deal on my ares expedition copy because of the Barnes and Noble sale (and they don’t have the original one at my local barnes and noble) so I’m hesitant to return it and get the original game off of amazon for double the price I paid for the ares expedition. 

I play with 2 groups of people, one likes more casual games, the other likes more intense games, I tend to like the more intense games myself but often struggle finding people who will play those games with me.

"(sorry for the bad English and confusing wording - I don't know a lot of board game jargon lol)

basically I was playing with my siblings and we were confused when we first learned about the Spy.

so let's say I have the spy and the politician in my hand. the other roles in play are the general, producer and communist (just an example). I can say ""I'm the spy"" and take one coin, and then I can say ""I'm also the producer"" and do his action. but then can someone else challenge me by saying ""you're not the producer""? or can they only challenge me by saying I'm not the spy? 

we all thought having the power to do any action at all without the risk of being challenged AND earning a coin on top of that is way too OP but we reread the rules and nothing said we could challenge her on whatever role she claims next. maybe the ruleset was poorly translated?

I searched around the forums and [found](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/zgwam5/best_heavyweight_2_player_board_game_with_long/) a lot of threads regarding 2 player games, longer games, legacy games, etc, but not recommendations for this particular requirement:

Dynamic games, that is, games that change from match to match and keep you interested.

For personal reasons I ended up living with my father again, and also discovered the joy of board games (only had played generic party games and Catan before). Quickly went through and enjoyed to different extents Azul, Pandemic, codenames duo, 7 wonders duel (great game), but only really found an excellent time when playing Pandemic Legacy Season 1. 

The game just keeps you wanting to go back to play the next month. It's been a great experience, and we only have 1 month left to go.

&amp;#x200B;

*Given we really like to optimize and can get quite action-paralyzed (a Pandemic Legacy month can go anywhere from 90 minutes to 3-4 hours for the first 3 months or so), what games would you recommend that either keep unlocking content, or mechanics, or are just really deep and each match you may encounter new strategies, etc? So we can grind it for a couple months at least before it feeling like it's the same thing over and over.*

*It could be legacy, campaign, coop or vs, etc. Not afraid to try out anything. Just bear in mind we're quite slow/AP, and that even picking a character can take 15 minutes haha.*

*On the other hand games that are too light really lose their interest after 1 or 2 matches (codenames, carcassonne, azul, regular pandemic).*

*If possible game length should not be over 2-3 hours for regular players, because I'm pretty sure that'd mean 4-6 hours for us, haha.*

"I recently played Secret Hitler with a new gaming group, and was astounded by how they played. It was so much different than my previous gaming group. 

To be clear, both groups play by the rules, the difference is entirely in how they play the social deduction portion of the game.

My first game with the new group, the President assigned a Chancellor, and then the President immediately called ""Okay, everyone ready? Three, two, one... vote!""

I literally shouted ""Wait!"". How am I supposed to vote? I need time to interrogate the players. Why did you make that person the Chancellor? Are you Hitler? What's your reasoning? Are you Hitler?

My fellow players were confused. They said ""there's nothing to interrogate yet, because we haven't seen anyone play yet. We can't start interrogating each other until we see people play Policies, because then we will have information to go on""

Which I get, but that's not the only information you have to go on. There's also just pure social deduction! How nervous does someone get when they are asked questions? Are they able to lie effectively? Will their later gameplay choices reflect what they told me at the beginning, or will I notice deviations later on?

With my old group, we'd start interrogating each other right from the first round.

With my new group, the interrogations didn't really start until there were already 2-3 policies on each track (basically, not until the last third of the game)

I want to reiterate, both of these seem to me to be valid ways to play the game.

The Santa Clauses, S01E04 features a game called ""Flip the Sheep"". The scene most prominently displaying it starts a little past four minutes in.

Game parts include (at least):

- A sheep-shaped spinner, with the name of the game in the middle of it, and with values ranging 1-8. The spinner appears to be made of wood.

- A hexagonal main game board, and rectangular player boards.

- Various game pieces and tokens, including a sheep piece which seems to be larger than any other piece.

- At least one custom card deck.

- A large, fold-out page of rules. It appears to be at least A0 in size. It is suggested that they may be primarily written in German, or that reading the German version may be helpful.

- Polyhedral dice, including at least one each of d8 and d6.

This is just taken from a quick look at a couple frozen screens, and some particular things said by the characters. More detailed examination of certain frames may yield additional useful information.

A Google search for ""Flip the Sheep"" hasn't turned up a lot of useful-looking results outside of the context of the show. In fact, I had to include the show's name in my search to bring up any results that looked relevant at all in the top ten. The game also doesn't appear to be listed under this name on Board Game Geek.

Is Flip the Sheep a real game, or based upon a real game? Or is this just a family-friendly tabletop version of  Angels With Filthy Souls?

"I am struggling to remember the name of a game I used to love - I can remember how to play it:

Two players with two sets of coloured marbles/stones and one or two die. A square board with numbered squares from one to forty(ish). 

The aim of the game is to get all your stones to travel around the board from the start of the square to the end. Players roll the dice which determines how many stones they can move or the amount of squares they can travel. Players can stack stones onto a square but cannot place stones on a square that the opponent has stacked stones. A player can send back an opponents stone by landing on the same square if the opponents stone is not stacked (a single stone on a single square). 

It has a Ludo-vibe and from what I remember a middle-eastern theme on the box.

"I just got a copy of Betrayal Legacy and I'm trying to make some 3D printed game pieces with my printer to spice things up. Myself and my 3 other friends have never played the legacy version before though so I was hoping that someone who has can give me some advice on what sorts of models will make sense without spoiling anything. 

&amp;#x200B;

Feel free to offer particular suggestions or just let me know if the token I'm printing out might not make sense in some scenarios. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Nest: BeeHive (unless the Nest can be bat's nest, or some other non bee related creature nest)

\- Clock: Grandfather clock (Not sure about the bloodsplatter on the reverse side of the token)

\- Inspector/Viktor: 2 sherlock holmes looking figurines

\- Eye open/closed: Floating eyeball with open and closed lid

\- Searched: Magnifying glass

\- Numbers: Literally just the 3D numbers (Unless they're supposed to be able to be hidden?)

&amp;#x200B;

Things I could use some ideas on because I don't know the context and don't want to spoil it without looking it up:

\- There's three 7 sided tokens; purple with the bust of a woman, green with the bust of a man, and yellow with image of bear tracks. I can print out busts for the man in the woman, but other than printing out an icon of a bear track, is there anything else that would make more sense?

&amp;#x200B;

\- Knowing particular monsters isn't a big deal as long as I don't know the context of the haunt so if you have any ideas for great large or small monsters I can print out then let me know

&amp;#x200B;

\- If there were any other items, omens, or objects that didn't have their own unique token that you think would have added to the immersion factor then feel free to suggest those as well. As an example there were some items/omens we printed off for the non-legacy version to add to the gameplay such as:

* Separate ""Dark Dice"" for the dark dice item card
* An actual little music box
* Printed minis for the ""companion"" omens like the cat, dog, madman, etc.
* tiny bell for the omen card",Betrayal Legacy: Requesting advice on making custom pieces.,1,self.boardgames,zwn6ym,Oneironautiluss,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/zwn6ym/betrayal_legacy_requesting_advice_on_making/,1672167839

Each team was presented with funding and a goal as well as control of specific resources. On each turn, a team could trade, build, buy, negotiate…

"I think *most* people *prefer* playing games in person, on normal boards. But for me, that is largely because the social situation is more enjoyable - I'd rather be in the room with friends, hanging out and playing. If you could replicate that social situation perfectly, but play electronically, would you?

Pros of electronic games:

* No set up or tear down, before or during. Things like shuffling are handled
* Bookkeeping is handled
* Nobody can cheat, on purpose or by accident
* Depending on the implementation, it can be easier to see and understand all the options

Cons of electronic games:

* Losing the tactile feel of the game
* The winner is just announced - a little harder to add tension while counting scores
* Often, it takes multiple clicks to do something that could be much faster in paper
* Sometimes a mis-click can completely ruin the game for someone, if there isn't a strong undo feature
* Timing restrictions can bog things down
* Sometimes random elements feel worse when a computer program is delivering the bad news

For me, a lot of it comes down to nobody can cheat on an online game versus the potential of a mis-click to completely ruin one game. Nobody cheating (or misplaying on accident) eases a lot of my mental load, because often I'm the one trying to explain the game and keep things on track. On the flip side though, I've definitely seen electronic games without an undo button where one mis-click 45 minutes in can completely change the course of a game, and often eliminate one person. It can be brutal when you don't really have time to restart, and they are out of the game just because of clunky implementation.","If the social situation and setting were equal, would you prefer playing board games electronically?",1,self.boardgames,zwi4g9,thearmadillo,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/zwi4g9/if_the_social_situation_and_setting_were_equal/,1672154731

"Let me give a little backstory first. My wife and I are in our thirties, I come from a very competitive family who has always played tons of board games of all makes. (Chess, risk, Catan, etc...)  We value victory and view it as battle of wits regardless of what game. Some  may say it gets cut throat we don't take it personal, it's just ""a smart move"".

You place tiles you cannot or DO NOT want to play in the floor line and take a penalty. She needed one more yellow to get all the yellows and a tent point bonus, so on my turn I took the yellow even though I couldn't play it and put it in my floor line accepting the penalty to prevent her ten points.

Wrong move! You would have thought I killed her unborn children.   Is this a legit play? Or did I cheat and rule snipe like a jerk. To me it seems they wouldn't include or DO NOT WANT TO in rules if they didn't expect someone to use it to block someone.

"How do you handle countering a strategy while not playing catch-up? This is more for two player games. 

Examples: in agricola if you're playing someone who goes in for wood and animals. If you just try to deny them these materials then you aren't forming your own strategy, you're letting them dictate. If you go your own way like grain/bread baking they have an easy path to an engine. Would you just take the first player marker to counter this?

In Scythe if you see someone going for Mechs right away you know they're going to get their mech benefits quickly. Sometimes I find myself chasing to keep up. I know scythe offers you many paths but it does seem mech benefits have more weight (I'm new to this game so I may be wrong).


Larger context:
I pretty much only play board games with my wife. She's detail oriented, doesn't think too far ahead, plays one turn at a time, takes what's there. I tend to go macro, try to think many moves ahead and string together home run moves. If this were NFL football I'm Josh Allen and she's Tom Brady. Thing is with our styles when it's just us, she tends to win games like agricola, mars or scythe because she simplifies. When we have played in groups she never wins because at least one other person tries to play more like me. In this case would you try to counter her methods or adopt them a little more? I hate feeling like I'm playing catch-up.

"Rules are same as normal monopoly except:


1. There is no auctioning. If you don't buy a property, it stays in the bank.

2. When you go to jail, instead of paying $50, you lose a turn. Also, you cannot collect rent while in jail. However, you can roll the dice on the turn that you are in jail, if you roll doubles, you break free.

3. A colour set is not required to build houses. You just have to land on your own property.

4. You cannot build houses whenever you want, even with a colour set. However, colour sets now double house rent as well.


Most of those rules were used because my parents don't know how to trade or auction, mostly because it consumes a lot of time. And under the normal rules, a round might never end, because of no one owning a colour set.

" I have a little Christmas present to you all.  


It's  a print-n-play old school pen-n-paper game. It's for 2-4 players  and  play 10-15 mins. I'm calling it Bump! for now. Of course you can  call  it whatever you want.  


The aim of the game is to be the last player standing in 2-3 player game or to be the last team standing in 4 players game.  


On  your turn you pick a direction and a distance of 1, 2 or 3 to hop.   Draw an arrow in the space you left behind to indicate the direction   you have chosen.  


If  you land on an empty space you stay there and your turn ends. If  you  land on an arrow that you hop once again in the direction of the  arrow -  this time your distance is one more than your previous hop - so  if you  hop distance 1, you will now hop the distance of 2. If your last  hop  was a 3 it will loop back to 1. You will keep hopping until you hit  an  empty space.

  
If  you land on a space occupied by another player's token you will  BUMP  that player - you will stop that that space and cause it to be bump  in  the same direction by the same distance you just hop. So if you last   hop was a distance of 2 - the bumped token will hop a distance of 2. If   the bumped token lands on an arrow it will continue hopping following   the normal hopping rule.

  
If your token hopped or bumped onto the middle death space or off the edge of the board that you are out of the game.  


You can print out the map below and place the token on the starting places or you can play it on TTS here:  [https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2907339552](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2907339552)

"Hi! Newly discovered this subreddit and hoping you can help me find a game. While on holiday in Germany many years ago, I watched a friend play a board game with his German mates.

Only example I remember is the face up card said “In Japan, when you’re 80 years old (can’t remember exact number) you’re allowed to do this.

"There are three of us in my family who like playing Pandemic. We've played it maybe 15-20 times over the past few years. We tend to play with 4 roles and no one steps on anyone's toes. We also have two of the expansions: On the Brink &amp; In the Lab. We do not have the last expansion (State of Emergency), and to be honest In the Lab is the only one we deem necessary.

Now with Legacy, I'm a little apprehensive about how to start. We haven't ""mastered"" the base game or expansions. Our win/loss rate is 1:3. We haven't won like the last 5 games and we haven't really got a ""game plan"" or come to agreement about which roles make for an ideal team (other than the Medic).   We've learned a few things along the way of course. Don't focus on eradicating, how to cooperate, etc. I'm kind of viewing the base game as a training scenario for ""Pandemic Response Team"", and Legacy will be ""the real world with real consequences.""

In the previous games, it says to deal a Defuse card to each player in their starting hand, which is the most powerful card in the game to help prevent blowing up by an Exploding Kitten.  In Zombie Kittens, the Zombie Kitten is basically the same thing with the added effect of resurrecting a dead player.

"In case I haven’t missed the boat, here’s my quick and dirty review of the 26 new-to-me games I played in 2022. Out of the group of four guys I was regularly playing with last spring, three of us had babies this year. That put a damper on our game time. On the bright side, that meant my wife and I played plenty of two player games. Games are sorted alphabetically, not chronologically or by my ratings. Also, I’m sure viewers of Shut Up and Sit Down can tell that I’m easily influenced.

\*\*Architects of the West Kingdom\*\*: I love all of Shem Philip's games I've played. Happy coincidence that my wife wanted a new worker placement / resource management game for her birthday. While I love worker placement games, sometimes it can feel a bit lonely because of the lack of player interaction. Leaving workers on the board until you choose to retrieve them with another worker, and weighing the reward of extra resources vs the risk of someone locking up all your workers from a given space nicely shakes up the worker placement aspect for me. I loved Mihajlo Dimitrievskis art for the ""North Sea"" series (North Sea-ries?) of games, did a fun job illustrating 800s Europe in this one.

\*\*Calico\*\*:  Quilt sewing – tile placing game, with cats! The cats are what makes it stand out from Azul. That being said, enough of my hardly-board-game-playing family know Azul already so I'll probably end up playing more of Azul than Calico moving forward.

\*\*Cryptid: Urban Legends\*\*: A small box two player competitive puzzle game where one player has the role of a scientist tracking down the mothman, and the other player is tries to avoid detection as the mothman. Never played the original Cryptid. My wife and I were looking for two player games and this one came up. It's interesting and engaging, but the length of the game is too quick. This last point is probably just a critique of myself, but I found one less than optimal move early gets myself pinned in a corner quickly.

\*\*Dead of Winter\*\*: Hidden Role - Traitor games are a blast with the right people. I like the resource hoarding aspect of this, as well as the individual hidden agendas. I'd play it again, but I feel like the whole zombie thing was overdone a decade ago. Not my favorite theme for a hidden role game. I didn't enjoy it as much as Battle Star Galactica. The next time I play a hidden role game, I'm hoping it's Unfathomable... but I own enough Lovecraft games and hidden role games I probably shouldn't convince myself to spend more money on a Lovecraft hidden role game.

\*\*Eldritch Horror\*\*: Played Arkham Horror 2nd edition years ago, liked it but didn't love it. Since then I found out I really enjoyed Pandemic. Eldritch Horror is kind of Pandemic meets Arkham Horror. Biggest complaint is that the first two games took a long time with a table full of players who had never played before. The reason that's a complaint, that group won't play it again! If time is an issue, or you don't think you're group would stomach that learning curve, try Pandemic: Reign of Cthulhu. It's kind of like Eldritch Horror-light, more obviously Pandemic.

\*\*Everdell\*\*: Worker placement / hand management game / resource management game. I love the art on this game. It reminds me of Brian Jacque's books from my childhood. However, not enough nostalgia for me to get past the feeling that the game is trying all game to draw the right pairs of cards. I'll play it again if friends want to, but I won't ever request it. I think I'm in the small minority on not enjoying this one. I feel like I’m missing something obvious about it considering how much everyone else likes it. But, just because it’s popular doesn’t mean I have to like it.

\*\*Food Chain Magnate\*\*: What a treat! It's everything that capitalism in game form should be. Area of influence, resource management, deck builder, constantly spending victory points, what's not to love? The only thing I don't like about it is how long the first game for new players takes, so it's hard to get to the table without my regular group being available. My wife and I played two-player a few times, good not great with two. If you can get a regular group interested, highly recommend. Lots of rules, but they are ALL bitesize-simply-do-what-the-card-says.

\*\*Great Western Trail 2nd Edition\*\*: I love westerns. The board is beautiful. I enjoy the way each player adds resource hubs onto the field of play. I thoroughly enjoyed this game. Unfortunately, despite the cute cows, my wife hated it but hasn't been able to articulate exactly what she hates about it. I'd love to play this more, but it will be difficult for me to get it to the table since most of the times I play games my wife joins.

\*\*Jaipur\*\*: Quick and fun! Easy to trade learn, medium to master. I won against my wife the first two times, but now it feels like she's on a 20 game win streak.

\*\*Kingdomino\*\*: Carcassone was one of the first board games I learned when getting into the hobby almost a decade ago. Kingdomino feels enough like Carcassone that I felt a bit nostalgic, while being different enough to feel fresh. The play is quicker, and I’m a sucker for drafting games. I’d happily play this more in the future.

\*\*Mage Knight\*\*: A friend of mine is nuts for this one, with multiple hundreds of hours logged on TTS. He had me play a co-op two player game to show me the ropes. Mostly I ended feeling like I didn't have enough of it to form a valid opinion on it. For learning the basics of it, I think he chose right in doing a co-op game, but I think it would be so much more engaging when it's competitive. Hopefully I get more of it someday, but I'm not in a rush to get it back on the table.

\*\*Mansions of Madness 2nd Edition\*\*: I LOVE(craft) this game! The app-driven stories have been engaging and entertaining every time I've played. The app makes set-up a breeze, so it's easier to get to the table than Eldritch Horror. MY wife enjoys this one, which is a big plus. It feels more functional at 2 players than Eldritch Horror or Arkham Horror. Want to play more of it, biggest reason we haven't got it to the table more often is that the next scenarios we're looking at have loooong expected play times.

\*\*Mansions of Madness: Horrific Journeys\*\*: Played one scenario from the Horrific Journeys expansion, it was even more fun than base game Mansions of Madness-. Without giving spoilers, it felt a bit like an Agatha Christie mystery we were playing through, but with a Lovecraftian cult looming in the shadows. I'm excited to play more of the scenarios in this expansion.

\*\*Mysterium\*\*: Had been looking at this for years, finally had a chance to play with some friends. It is a lot like Dixit, but everyone is on a team and the clues can change. Not my favorite. I'd play again if I was already at a game night and everyone else wanted to. I'm likely hesitant for more because I overplayed Dixit in the past and this feels similar.

\*\*OATH\*\*: Due to the art, game designer, and me being a dummy, I expected it to be more like Root than it is. I'm not 100% sure I can count this as played. My wife and I got 75% through our first game doing the ""first game walkthrough"" before we ran out of time and decided to try it again with more people… which hasn’t happened yet. I can definitely see the appeal, but two players is not the right player count. Very excited to get a handful of interested people together for it. It feels more card driven than I expected, and I think the emphasis is on constantly using the cards as you get them, not so much sitting on them until an opportune moment like I'm used to. The impression I get is that with a full table, it’s supposed to feel like a game of ROOT where everyone is constantly playing Dominance cards to change their own win condition. Absolutely love the art on everything from Leder Games.

\*\*Pagan: Fate of Roanoke\*\*: Best two player game I've played. Battle of wits, witch vs witch-hunter in colonial America. If anyone has seen Death Note, it feels like Light vs L from that anime. I don't want to call it a worker placement, but it feels a bit like one because of how you play your action tokens to do things and block your opponent from doing the same thing. Quick set up, easy to learn the mechanics, beautiful art. The hidden information that both sides have is so fun. It's easy to get caught up in your own strategy and forget what your opponent does or doesn't know you know. I beat my wife the first two games, but she's a... more steady learner and can read me better than I can read her, so she's now on a 5ish game win-streak. Can't recommend this game enough! Only down side is the price tag. When I decided to get it, I couldn't find it for sale in North America, so the shipping from Europe more than doubled the price. However, since shipping was a flat rate, I decided to roll the dice (but there aren't dice in the game) and order all of the expansions for it at once. Side note: in our games, the witch hunter has won a disproportionate amount of the time, if anyone has tips for the witch I'm all ears.

\*\*Puerto Rico\*\*: Heard great things about this game for years, finally had an opportunity to try it. Balance resources, opportunity cost, and limited action choices. It was pretty straight forward and engaging. Biggest issue I had was that the ""workers"" you can ""buy"" from ships were brown tokens. That made me uncomfortable. I hear later versions have adjusted that somehow, but I haven't heard how. I'd probably play again if someone wanted to, especially if it's a later version without the buyable brown workers.

\*\*Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Curse Island\*\*: Area movement, exploration, adventure survival game on an island. The box art had caught my eye for years, finally had one chance to play. The scenario I played had cannibals, which I loved. The whole game we were just barely getting resources and fulfilling objectives to survive, but when the end came it came quickly. We flipped an objective that we just straight up wouldn't be able to do given our current resources and the clock. I'd play it again, I suspect it's better with more than two players. We felt limited with what we were able to do in a turn. One reason I might not have enjoyed it as much as I think I would have, when I played this I was on the tail end of co-op binge and I was more than ready for some real competition, but instead I got yet another co-op game. I shouldn’t hold that against it, it’s not the games fault I was co-op’d out by then.

\*\*ROOT\*\*: I think I initially heard this game described as Redwall meets Risk, which isn’t too far off. Asymmetric, area of controlc strategic war game that has all the cutest critters slaughtering their neighbors. I can't get enough of it! Every turn feels like a puzzle you have to solve. Even when it's not my turn, I find myself looking at other players current board state and considering what their best moves are. The asymmetry across all factions is enough to always keep me on my toes. I haven’t been able to eek out a win with my favorite faction (join me in worshipping the lizard god!) but I’ve found that to be more of a challenge I’m scheming to surpass instead of a frustrating wall, which I think is the mark of a well-designed game. In my recent games, I've enjoyed seeing temporary alliances form across the table for underdogs to beat up on the current leader. My only complaint is that it's hard to introduce the game to new people. Even quick and dirty summaries of the factions end up eating a lot of the time we have allotted to play. Highly recommend. Can't get enough of this. 

\*\*Seven Wonders Duel\*\*: A stream lined version of 7 Wonders for exactly two players. Instead of pick-and-pass drafting game, the cards are laid out in front you in a pyramid. Higher cards can't be selected until cards overlapping them from below are chosen. About half the cards are facedown before they are available for selection, which adds a nice amount of uncertainty into your choices and long term planning. This is one of the few games my wife hasn't got my number on, so I enjoy that. All in all, I like 7 Wonders better, but I do suggest this if you enjoy 7 Wonders but are often limited to two players.

\*\*The Crew\*\*: This is a trick taking masterpiece. I think it's best described as a cooperative version of Euchre. Instead of trying to get the whole group to win all the tricks, there are objective cards that say which player is allowed to win which tricks, or can't win a trick with a card higher than X, or has to win more of one suite than another. These start off simple, but as they compound and stack multiple objective cards at once it gets interesting. That sounds like it'd would still be easy, but the trick is that talking, signaling, and otherwise communicating the contents of your hand is not allowed. Other than the slap of cards on the table, the only sounds that occur are frequent groans when players realized they screwed the pooch by initiating what would have been a perfectly laid plan one trick too early. It's most fun playing with the same group repeatedly and getting to challenging goal combinations together, but so far it's still been a hoot to teach it to beginners and start over on the difficulty track. One of the best aspects of the game is that each round only takes about 5 minutes. You can play as long or short as the group wants, except that most of the time someone says ""This will have to be my last round."", after nearly but not quite winning that round the same person is almost guaranteed to say ""Well, I probably have time for ONE MORE hand if we deal hands fast..."". If you still have family in town for the holidays and you don't have this game, go buy it now.

\*\*Ticket to Ride: Europe\*\*: Slight variation on a classic simple train game. Even with the addition of rules or tweaking of previous rules, the best part of this is the change of scenery with a new map. For those who don’t know Ticket to Ride, you collect colorful train cards in order to play trains on color-matched routes, while trying to claim routes that connect the tickets you drew as your objective cards. Straight forward, simple game, good for introducing people to the hobby, especially younger people. As enjoyable as Ticket to Ride (and all variations) can be, I won't actively seeking out this game until my daughter is old enough to start learn board games.

\*\*Trash Pandas\*\*: Push your luck dice game with trashy art. The die has symbols instead of numbers that correspond to actions (dig through the trash to claim more trash, place your trash into your stash, steal trash from an opponents hand, etc). Each time you roll the die, you take a token matching the action you rolled. You roll until you (a) decide to stop rolling and execute the actions you rolled, or (b) roll a repeated result at which point your turn is bust and you’re stuck with just drawing a single card. It's cute, it’s alright. The best part of this game is how easy it is to teach to those pesky un-teachable relatives.

\*\*Treasure Island\*\*: I am sad to say that this sat on my shelf in shrink for almost 6 months before we finally gave it a try. I just wish I had opened it sooner! The premise of this game, Long John Silver has buried treasure on an island and then his mutinous crew locked him up in prison. One player plays Long John, who periodically gives clues about the treasures where-abouts to the table... But up to twice per game, Long John can be dishonest with the clues he gives. The other players each play as one of the mutineers, trying to be the first to get to the treasure. Up to twice per game, each player can spend an action to privately determine the validity of the previously delivered clues, which adds a fun level of hidden information to the game. Each player has a minimap to mark up with their own info and ideas, and some actions require arcs or swaths to be colored in on the main map. After some number of turns, Long John escapes his cell and must beeline to the treasure. Whoever gets to the treasure first wins.  So far I've only played it with two players, and it was a blast. I can only imagine that the game really shines with 4-5 players. Hoping to get it to the table with extended family before the new year. On a side note, how players make decisions with partial information really makes it feel how Clue should have felt, if that makes sense. This pirate game is a real treasure, be sure it dig it up.

\*\*Twilight Imperium 4th Edition\*\*: Starships. Black holes. Laser cannons. Worm holes. Asteroid fields. Galactic domination. Other than the price tag, time commitment, and difficulty to schedule it, what's not to love? Heard about this game for years, finally had a chance to play it when a few friends were home alone while the wives were gone on the weekend. It did not disappoint. I was one of the three that hadn't played at all, the two people who had played before wiped the floor with us. The final scores were 10, 6, 5, 1, &amp; 1 at the end of the game. Our game lasted from 9 am until 6pm, with an hour long lunch break in the middle. This was not so much a game as it was an experience. I am curious as to how it would feel different when played at a table with physical pieces instead of on Tabletop Simulator. I'm excited to play it again, but I think the most likely scenario is I play it 2-3 more times before I die of old age.

\*\*Wingspan: Oceania\*\*: Fun expansion to Wingspan. The addition of nectar adds a bit of agency to the bird feeder. The new birds art as fantastic as the base game. If you enjoy Wingspan but feel like it's getting slightly stale, I recommend shaking it up with this expansion.

While I did manage to reduce the number of shelf-of-shame games this year, there are a few games added to that list that I’m still very excited to play. \*\*My Father’s Work\*\*, \*\*War of the Ring\*\*, \*\*Cthulhu Wars Duel\*\*, and \*\*Paladins of the West Kingdom\*\* are the games I’m most excited to remove from the shelf of shame in 2023. I’m also hoping to add one of the \*\*Nemesis\*\* variants to my collection, even if I won’t be able to quickly get it to the table.

I know the passive and aggressive turn order, but my question is: can you make L shaped moves, or could you move forward once and backwards once (even if this seems like a pointless play). And then obviously your aggressive move has to be the same movement on another board.

"*Note: I have never played the green side on paper, only online.*

I’ve been playing Wingspan on Nintendo Switch and have noticed the end of round scoring seems completely bazaar.

One of the goals was “Birds in wetlands”.

I started the round with one bird, player-B started with one, and played-C started with zero.

Myself and player-B finished with two birds, and player-C finished with one.

The scoring gave player-B and player-C a tie at 2, and it put me last at 1!

I have no idea how it calculated this. I will say that I kept checking throughout the round and noticed the scores shifting around.

So this is just a quick shout out to the groups that make the games worth playing and can find the fun in whatever games you bring to the table with minimal effort. 

We brought some games to our family Christmas that normally have us in stitches with our friends. They either didn't want to try them (codenames, ticket to ride) or waited for it to become fun to them without initiating any kind of competition (tsuro). 

Don't get me wrong if someone's not into it then that's fine but when the expectation is on you to provide some entertainment and there's not a lot you can do to make them get it then it becomes frustrating.

"Hello boardgamers,

Our small group has been working laboriously over the past 11 months to turn what started as a joke into a fully fledged boardgame &amp; wargame. I posted a few pictures a couple of weeks ago to announce our campaign draft on Gamefound so I thought I'd share a bit more, including a few pages from the rulebook and give a bit of a rundown on how the game works and plays.

Like most wargames, players start by designing their train and recruiting their crew (list building as some would say). 6 engines types, 8 different carriages, 18 weapons and 24 pieces of equipment mean you can tailor your train to suit your playstyle. Heavily armed and armoured land dreadnought? Light, fast and hard hitting? Minimal combat with plenty of room for freight or passengers? The choice is yours. On top of that, the 6 unique playable factions offer their own pros and cons, adding another layer of strategic nuance. Do you play as the steadfast and stoic Scions of Althann with their improved armour? The tricksy and whimsical Royaume Remnants? As a final layer to the list building, your crew are the resource for performing actions during the game. To you buy maximum cheap Railhands (generic untrained workers) or pay extra for the Specialist, each one having been trained and experienced in one action? Specialists come in 10 different variants and you can recruit in any combination of Railhands and Specialists to suit your strategy. 

In game, trains are represented from an external perspective with the use of models (which our sculptor is fastidiously working away at and they are amazing!) that run on Rail cards, meaning no two games will have the same tracks. Internally, your trains are represented by carriage cards which form a representation of your train model for you to keep track of crew placement, fuel, cargo and passengers (or prisoners if you've managed to kidnap any).

Game play involves 3 phases; Locomotion, Action and Recovery. Locomotion involves managing your train's speed, one of the most important aspects of running through the rail wilderness; your speed indicates how many actions you can take in the Action phase and fastest train gets turn priority in the Action phase. But go too fast and you risk derailing (the second worst thing that can happen to your train) or too slow and you risk having your train devoured by the living railgrowth (the worst thing). The Action phase sees players alternate moving their train and performing a single action. Serve passengers to gain tickets, cool your engines, repair damage, fire your weapons at opponents or even leap fearlessly to enemy trains to assault, loot or even hijack are just a few of the actions available. Alternating activation and reactive actions keep all players constantly engaged meaning there's no downtime between turns or waiting for your chance to play. Act strategically, utilising the advantages of your train build and crew strengths. The Recovery phase involves cleaning up unused Rail cards and readying your crew for the next round. 

If this sounds like a game you'd be interested in, follow our draft page on Gamefound for some exciting updates in the next couple of days. Early access to the Rulebook is something we look forward to.

"I played *Walk the Plank* with friends a while back and purchased my own copy to play with family this Christmas. Rules were explained to me. The wording in the rule book gives me some doubt about whether we were playing one rule correctly.

As I understood it you can't play the same ""Skully"" card on consecutive turns, so you set any played Skully cards aside after playing them so they're not part of your choices for the next round. They come back to your hand after that round.

However, the wording in the manual is (emphasis mine): ""Some cards have a ""Skully"" symbol on the card; these cards can't be played two rounds in a row. At the end of the round in which one or more players use any of these cards, *they set them aside face up, so other players know which card can't be used during the next round*.""

Is it that ""other players know which card can't be used **by that  player** in the next round, or other players know which card can't be used **by anyone** in the next round? It's not clear to me whether playing a Skully card blocks anyone else from playing that card next.

"TLDR: Ordered sixteen items on Nov 23rd for a Christmas present. Have had multiple excuses about why they haven't been shipped followed by we will ship them tomorrow... It's now after Christmas, and they have not been shipped.

First off, I'd like to say I am a huge GTG fan. I have kick-started most of their products and have a full set of both Sentinels and Spirit Island... They are great game makers...

So when I saw in late November that they had huge discounts on a lot of the Sentinels expansions, I decided I would purchase everything they had that was on sale and gift it to my nephew for Christmas. It was the perfect gift, since he has always enjoyed playing the game with us and always asks to play when he visits and now has graduated college and has a place of his own...

16 items in total including promo heros and expansions, everything except for the base game, which I knew he already owned... It was going to be an epic Christmas experience.

...WAS

Two weeks later I noticed I still had not received a shipping notice, so I messaged GTG asking about the status of my shipment. They replied 3 days later that one item was out of stock and that they refunded the item and we're sending the rest... Strange I thought... But okay.

A week later and no shipping update, so I messaged again, starting to worry that the items would not arrive in time. Two additional items were now not in stock... But they assured me that they would send my items...

Another week passed and it was less than a week til Christmas. I messaged again since I had received no word of shipment. They said they would ship the items but could not guarantee they would get here before Christmas. I was LIVID... After a rant via email they decided to refund my entire purchase. No word of if they plan on ever sending my items...

It is now Dec 26th... no games, &amp; no shipment info... I had to scramble and buy a secondary gift for my nephew which was pretty lame... A Tshirt and a mug.  I could tell he was a bit bummed when he opened them... (We were sort of his surrogate parents while he was growing up and have always spoiled him a bit on Christmas)

"Hi folks, got Starcadia Quest Build-a-Robot as a gift and I was wondering about the little robots, specifically how durable the little peg on the head is.  It seems ok but I have a couple of concerns.

Firstly how often do people swap the heads?  Is there any concern for the peg wearing out or breaking?

I will be painting them and I'm a bit worried that the fit will be too tight after paint is applied.  Has anyone painted a set of these?  

In light of these I was considering magnetizing them.  Would this be worth doing or am I overthinking it?

"I've played Charterstone 1.8 times. The first time through was rough, as the game leader (the guy who owned the game) misinterpreted a couple of rules that caused my wife and I to never win a session. But we pushed through to the end, and didn't even come close to winning the campaign. Now knowing the rules, we bought the game and tried again with my kids. I got to game 10 and everyone was done.

We figured out resource engines the second time around but after multiple sessions of doing almost the exact same thing, everyone was bored of the game. I'm someone who doesn't give up if the game has potential, so I bought the Recharge Pack and want to try again. But this time I want to skip the legacy part and just build the most balanced worker placement game of Charterstone that I can with intentional building placement.

Has anyone done this? Any thoughts on what building should be in a charter and what buildings should go on islands? What is the best engines per charter or interesting synergies. My goal is to have a one-shot worker placement game for a group of 6. No more legacy mode, no more customization, just a good old fashioned board game.

"Partner and I are having an intense argument over a Skip-Bo rule. On partner’s turn , he grew one of the build piles to 12. He had a 1 in his stack pile but did not play it. After he discarded, I pointed out that he did not play his 1, and he claimed that he should get to redo his last play because the 12 pile should have been cleared. 

My argument is that yes, the 12 pile should have been cleared BY HIM, and the fact that he failed to do that in order to play his 1 was poor strategy. His argument is that it is every players’ responsibility to clear the 12 pile and the fact that I noticed the 12 pile was complete but did not clear it meant that I broke the rules by not moving that completed pile to the side (even though it was not yet my turn). He argues that I’d Skip Bo was online the 12 pile would have been cleared automatically by the computer. 

Help us settle the argument… who is right?

It should be noted that on a prior turn, I accidentally played a build card out of order (I played a 6 on top of a 4 instead of the 5 in my hand I meant to play, and my partner let me fix it).",Intense argument over Skip-Bo rule,1,self.boardgames,zvpyb3,Relative_Client_7791,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/zvpyb3/intense_argument_over_skipbo_rule/,1672069963

"I'm with my family for Christmas and there are precisely 5 of us. The box for Ultimate Werewolf says 5-68 players, but I'm guessing it means 5 players AND a moderator.

The only way I can think for it to work is by having 3 normal villagers (so no seer) and 1 werewolf. But then we only really get 1 night, because if they don't lynch anyone after the first night, the werewolf will kill 1 more person and gains parity with the villagers, thus winning.

Is this essentially what One Night Ultimate Werewolf is? I've seen that that's sold as a separate game, but I've never played it?

My GF and I enjoy games a lot, and by far the one we play the most is Pandemic; we mainly play 2 players, but have a couple friends we sometimes play 4 players games with.

That said, we are at the point that we feel a bit like ""having solved"" the base game and feel we're ready to either buy an expansion, a different iteration of the game or \*maybe\* a brand new game that can give us a ""similar, but not too similar"" experience.

After having done some research I still have no idea what to buy:  
\-I've been considering Legacy, but we play a lot and I don't feel like spending that kind of money on a game that wouldn't last more than 3 months for us;  
\-I've been considering expansions, but I can't find them for less than 35€ and it feels like quite a lot of money for what we would be getting (we actually paid less for the base game), so I was wondering if it's really worth it instead of buying a different game altogether for the same money;  
\-and lastly, I've been considering the variants (mainly Iberia and Rising Tide), but I couldn't really get a grasp on how much the gameplay is different from the base game (and therefore, how much mileage we could get out of them).

Just to clarify: we already have a good amount of competitive games we're satisfied with (for now), so we're only considering coop games!

So, any advice? Thanks to everybody in advance!",Expanding Pandemic - what to buy?,1,self.boardgames,zvnogm,Jimmyjazzs,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/zvnogm/expanding_pandemic_what_to_buy/,1672063131

"I thought I'd throw my hat into the ring among all these ""new to me"" posts for 2022. These are all games where my first play took place in 2022, but they may have been released years earlier. 

**7 Wonders Architects**. This has been a divisive game on this subreddit, but I enjoyed it. There's something fulfilling about games that don't require you to spend resources and just judge the cards presented. 

**Scout**. I saw the SU&amp;SD review and have been looking for it ever since. It finally landed in my area, and it's been a huge hit with everyone who has played it. The tension between building a better hand and playing now is excellent. 

**Splendor Duel**. I agree with everything The Dice Tower people said. If you like Splendor, this is a great two player variant. If you don't like Splendor, there's enough new ideas here that it may draw you in. 

**Fugitive**. I'd been eyeballing this since it was released and found it on a used shelf. This rides a good line between mathy and intuitive, and I adore the way the cards create the story of the fugitive escaping when laid end to end. 

**Sleeping Gods**. This was easily the most anticipated game I played for the first time in 2022. I only played it twice because setup and teardown are prohibitive. Also, my spouse and I got more heavily into Arkham Horror LCG, which scratches a very similar itch (though the later campaigns have a similar setup and teardown problem). 

**Horrified American Monsters**. This was a huge letdown after playing the original. The heroes have no new abilities, and the monsters are often confusing to run. Sasquatch is actually broken without a rule clarification. 

**Mechs vs Minions**. I was pumped for this, but the intro was boring, and the first scenario was more difficult than fun. I may enjoy this if I played it in a more ""serious"" gaming setting. 

**New york zoo**.  I don't get excited for polyomino games, but they are still satisfying to play, and I love the added element of filling pens with animals to get extra pieces. 

**Abracada...What?**. I enjoyed this as a light filler when the game wrapped, but the more I thought about each play made the more I realized the hidden information is there to hide the fact you sometimes cannot win and hiding that prevents you from feeling like you're out when the round begins. 

**Ahoy**. I've only played this at two, and it had the classic Leder Games moment at the end of ""oh, *that's* how this is supposed to be played."" I want to give this a try at 3 players. 

**Beez**. I enjoyed the puzzly nature of how your bee moves around, but my spouse absolutely despised this game. 

**Canvas**. This presents itself as a light card crafting game, but it generates way too much analysis paralysis for the time it takes to play. Neither my spouse nor myself were impressed at all. 

**Caper europe**. The seesaw element is interesting since it is affected by which thieves you place and what equipment you give them, but my spouse was bored by this one, so it only got played once before it was sold. 

**Cascadia**. This only took one play to reveal all it had to offer. My spouse and I both felt like we'd seen everything after one play. 

**Dwellings of Eldervale**. Scored a used copy of the all-in pledge at my used game store. I've only been able to get it to the table once, but I'm itching for more. 

**Fantasy Realms**. I'd heard of this for years and thought it sounded fun. I picked up the reprint that came out this year and found it to be a great filler with some problematic ""male gaze"" art. Luckily, the deluxe edition was released this year as well, so I sold the first one and replaced it with an edition that has the first expansion plus some promos and, more importantly, much improved art. 

**The game of Things**. At first blush ""Apples to Apples where you write the answers"" sounds better, but in reality it just slows the game down. I'm not a fan of Apples to Apples and this is worse. 

**Great Plains**. I thought this looked like a cool variant of games like Hey, That's My Fish!, which I love, but it was simply bland. There is no interesting hook here

"Around 2013/2014, I used to hang out with a friend and her family on occasion, her sister, bro-in-law, nephew and niece.  They would play this board game that I was mandated to play since I showed up during them playing it.  After a few times of participating I actually enjoyed it.  I am no longer friends or acquainted with this person or family, nor will I attempt to contact them in any way.

Here's the challenge, I don't remember much, other than i thought it was pretty fun.  Here is the best and only description I am able to provide.

Board game, I believe an adventure/maybe fantasy type.

Had descriptive cards as part of it but have no memory of that they were or what they were for.

I do not recall any actual play pieces, but that does not mean they weren't there.

This type of board game was part of, what I believe, an extensive series.  Meaning, aside from the original version, there were extensions or 'add-ons' to the original.  However, I do not recall whether the original game had to be set up or if the add-ons could be used separately.  I'm leaning towards you have to have the original game for it to work.

That is all, and the best I can provide after nearly a decade. I know it isn't much to go on.

All I ask, if for suggestions and/or links and maybe seeing it will spark my memory.

Splendor is a favorite game of mine, and this year for Christmas my fiancée got me the Cities of Splendor expansion set. It’s been a while since we’ve been able to play, so I reviewed the original rule book while learning the new expansions, and I realized I don’t think I’ve ever set the game up according to the 2-/3-player setups.

Those things are easy to comprehend and adjust to, but what does the ‘No change for gold tokens’ rule mean?

I read ”change” like ”getting change back after a purchase,“ so would that mean the don’t act like wilds anymore, or something else?

"Ten years ago, on December 25, 2012, my family gifted me Settlers of Catan for Christmas. I learned about the game on a random r/askreddit thread about favorite boardgames and went into the post expecting the classic boardgames since I had never played nor heard of modern boardgames. Instead, I saw Catan pop up a nmber of times and with a quick detour reading up on [German-style boardgames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurogame), I asked my parents for it for Christmas. 

Having played it a number of times in 2013 and introduced it to friends, I did some research on this subreddit, BGG, and YouTube to see what other highly rated games were recommended. I did the thing that many people recommend you not to do and looked at the top 100 and picked out a few that I would ask for in Christmas 2013. I received Dominion and Agricola.

Dominion was pretty easy to learn and I played it with my then girlfriend a couple of times and enjoyed it. Learning the rules to Agricola took me about a week. I took me some time to understand what I could and couldn't do and when. My girlfriend and I played a 2-player game and definitely got the rules wrong the first time as I somehow ended the game with 27 grain. We reread the rules and played it correctly and I absolutely fell in love with the game. I loved how tight and competitive it was without being directly confrontational. I loved the visceral fear of possibly ""starving"" and needing begging cards. There was so much to do and not enough time to do it. Catan got me interested in the hobby but Agricola completely pulled me down the rabbit-hole and I've never looked back since. 

In the years since, I've gotten games for Christmas, bought a few games myself once I started working, introduced many newcomers to games, and have enjoyed every moment of it. My family and my in-laws (married my girlfriend) all expect me to bring new games to every event together. All my friends know me as the ""boardgame guy."" And while I know boardgames are not everyone's favorite activity, I think I have a good track record over the last decade of finding a game for everyone that they'll enjoy. And I've been eternally grateful that my wife is equally invested in boardgames and enjoys them just about as much as me.

Now for the actual collection, here are some of my thoughts:

* I have \~120 games and I've tried to spread out the weight, play time, player count, etc so I have something to play with any group. I don't have a ""gaming group"" but instead usually introduce people to the hobby. Even then, I'd say my collection leans on the heavier side.
* Of all the games I've had, I've only given away 3 games: Love Letter, Anomia, Great Western Trail 1st Ed. My wife is averse to giving away games. I gave Love Letter to my young nephew because we kept on playing it and he *really* enjoyed it. I began despising it because of how many times we played. Looking back, the game is completely inoffensive but I couldn't stand to play it now. I gave Anomia to my BIL because they were starting to build a collection and purchased the party edition instead. I gave away GWT to get the second edition. 

Top 5 games

1. **Food Chain Magnate**. It used to be Agricola for the longest time but FCM was revalatory for me. During the pandemic, my wife and I must have played &gt;100 times online. This is basically the perfect game for me and I love everything about it.
2. **Agricola**. I always wonder if it's just nostalgia but when I play it, I remember why I like it so much. Love the tight game play and I want as much of that as possible in any game I play.
3. **LOTR LCG.** Collected cards for a few years and played regularly with my wife. Currently, all my cards are hidden behind the cardboard barrier on the bottom to protect them from my son as he crawls around. It's also why a lot of the games on the second row are pushed back. 
4. **Istanbul.** My wife and I got this as a wedding gift and played it daily as newlyweds. We've gotten to the point where we can set up, play, and pack up in about 15 minutes. We usually have  [this soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hl_tNk8MWQw) playing to set the atmosphere.
5. **Great Western Trail**. I enjoyed this game enough that I gave it away to get the second edition and recently picked up the expansion. I'm really excited about GWT: Argentina. 

Recent games I've enjoyed:

1. **Art Robbery**: simple rules, simple gameplay, lots of fun. Really portable which I value a lot.
2. **For Sale**: just picked up the small box version while at my in-laws and really happy with the short game play but interesting decisions and the very, very small box.
3. **Free Ride**: I enjoyed this game way more than I thought I would. I love seeing the rails being built and the interconnectedness.
4. **Paint the Roses**: played this over Thanksgiving with the full 5 and had an absolute blast. I had to take a mental break for a while though to recover.
5. **Hansa Teutonica**: I don't get at least 3-players often enough that are willing to play this game. But everytime I do, I always love it. Love the simple actions but the deep game play and the need to work off of what others are doing.

Currently, my wife and I only get to play a couple of times a week at best with our work schedules and caring for our son. I try to schedule game nights with friends or bring lots and lots of games to family events to play as much as possible. 

Any recommendations based on what's in my collection? I could keep going on and on but happy to answer any questions you may have.

Are you allowed to hold on to (public) lesson cards or do they need to be played immediately?


The rule book says that the lesson cards ""must be played in this phase"". My husband interprets it as the cards cannot be used/played during any other time of the game. I interpret it as the cards cannot be held onto and must either be played immediately or discarded in the buying phase.


If you can hold onto public lesson cards then you can obviously use it to your advantage during the last few rounds.

"Hello folks,

I am going to ask you a strange question. Do you think that, playing several and several times, it is possible to infere the rules used by Descent legends of the dark app? I am asking you this for mainly two reasons:

1) What if the app will not be updated/supported anymore?
2) If one can understand the app rules, it will be possible to play on 5 instead in 4. The fifth player will act as the opponent in other descent games. Of course, in this case the heroes have to handle the inventory and all the stuff by themselves.

* Relatively short game time (45 minutes-ish) and can get a few games in during our 3-hour game window.
* Light strategy with some luck (we don't mind the dice rolls)
* 2 player
* The war theme is good, but not important
* The variety of scenarios is great

"Happy holidays!

I’m planning a New Year’s Eve party and would like to have a social deduction game activity but one that goes for the entire evening. 

I enjoy games like Werewolf/Mafia but have never liked the player elimination aspect. Blood on the Clocktower sounds intriguing but the cost plus that is a focussed session would not fit what I am looking for. 

My idea is to have some kind of game that is a sort of meta game for the evening for guests to enjoy as they mingle. I e had a couple of ideas so far but I’m having trouble getting my head around the specifics and thought I would see if perhaps there was something already made along what I’m thinking I can use, and if not maybe you could all provide some suggestions as to how to make these work. 

The first idea was to have a box with something inside, a fake jewel or coin, something along those lines. The box would be kept on a table in plain sight of everyone attending the party and would be locked with a three digit code padlock. As people arrive I would provide them an envelope explaining the game and that three of them would be given one part of the code secretly, but none of them would know who each other are. The three with the code would have to try and figure out who each other are and steal the object inside without being detected by the end of the evening. Everyone else would need to try and figure out all three of the conspirators. My concern is there may not be enough information for one side or the other or perhaps it may not be weighted well between the two sides as is.

The second idea was to provide everyone with a secret trait with a matching partner where they must try and figure out who their partner is but must do it in a way that others can’t guess what their trait is. For example one pair may be that person A likes to rub their belly while person B likes to pat their head. Or person A likes to say Marshmallow and person B likes to say Chocolate. At the end of the evening we would see who thinks they should be paired together. If they are correct then the rest of the group must try and guess what the pairing is before it is revealed based on what was observed throughout the night.

Just a couple of ideas but really I’m looking for any suggestions for pre-existing meta games or help in modifying these, or any other good ideas. :)",Party game suggestion or help making one,1,self.boardgames,zv1w6p,Cyberdork2000,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/zv1w6p/party_game_suggestion_or_help_making_one/,1671987780

I'm in the market for a board game table on the cheaper side. I know of fancy board game tables with felt tops and recessed to allow pieces to not fall off but they're out of my price range. The typical fold out plastic tables are just not big enough and would require 2. I would need a large table for wargamming and other tabletop games like Talisman which require a large table with all the corner boards. 6 foot by 3 foot should be a starting point.

"This has been my first full year with a solid play group so some of these will probably seem fairly odd to have not already played

Despite initially going wild on Kickstarter I realised this year that the well regarded games are usually held in such high esteem for a reason, and I've really got a feel for what I like in a game, so Ive been moving over to purchasing more established games at retail.  If you have any recommendations for games that fit with these by all means let me know. Barrage is top of my list to try in 2023


10. Dog Park - I was worried going into this that it would insubstantial or would suffer by virtue of its huge deck of cards, but that deck only does about 13 different things, and the auctions keep it from ever feeling too luck reliant. The management of flow of resources in and out makes for really interesting little puzzle and the game zips along. Probably deserves to have wingspan's spot tbh as this feels more like an actual gateway game to me.


9. New York Zoo - The first of four consecutive Uwe Rosenberg games, which is purely coincidental, I wouldnt even consider him a designer that I would specifically seek out, it just so happens that he's made a lot of good games in the ballpark I've been playing this year. The tile placement and animal breeding here combine well with the theme here to make for a nice breezy game that you still have to engage with. Played at 2 and keen to try with more players


8. Feast For Odin - Love all the options and different available strategies here, without it ever feeling like you've overcommitted and dug yourself a hole if anything doesn't go your way. A little too much going on for me to want to play every week, but definitely keen to play again.


7. Bohnanza - While this went on longer than we expected it was a lot of fun, and I think has the potential to work with a wide range of groups &amp; experience levels. I bought the 25th anniversary edition so looking for an opportunity to play with 7 as I can imagine it's chaos.


6. Agricola - Much more distilled worker placement than FFO, I'd tried to play the app version and it seemed horrifically dry, but playing with friends meant I got to see it in all its headache inducingly frustrating glory as every turn someone else shot down my plans and I reached for that first player action again. Can see why it wouldn't be someones cup of tea but I love that sense of jostling for control


5. Honey Buzz - I'd had my eye on this for a while based on it having a great theme and production but seeming to be a less volatile and slightly more weighty euro than something like wingspan with it's huge deck of cards. Loved how surprisingly cutthroat the foraging was as well as the interesting take on worker placement where you're performing actions in the future


4. Power Grid - Played this based on looking for games along the lines of my #1 pick and it was great fun. I love games that have simple rulesets that provide huge depth and this has that in spades. The auctions, resource management and building all hang together perfectly.


3. Cryptid - Going into this I thought there was no way I'd be able to focus on gleaming the information I needed to from the game state, but somehow it comes together and both the intensity of trying to work out what everyone's clue is, along with the tension of hoping no-one else gets there first, that leads to an almost push your luck feeling as you decide whether to gamble or push for more information makes this stressful in the best way


2. Beyond The Sun - Elegant worker placement with everything branching off your one action, and the tech tree, and how much you try and influence it, giving you so much potential variance in strategy.


1. Food Chain Magnate - This is everything I want from a game, the rules are relatively straightforward but the depth is immense, the player interaction is at the perfect pitch, and you really have to keep an eye on what's going on or you could lose the game in one turn, but even being in a helpless postion didnt really feel bad. Everyone I played wkth wanted to play again immediately, despite the winner finishing with about 400% of the score of the second place. Having played FCM leaves me happy that there may be even better splotter games for me still to discover, and sad that every other game I play in future may pale in comparison",Another top 10 New to Me in 2022,1,self.boardgames,zuy3to,CROMAGZ,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/zuy3to/another_top_10_new_to_me_in_2022/,1671974845

"Hey fellow board game friends! :)

I want to make a personalized Clue game to play with my friends and I have a question regarding the ""mathematics"" of the core game principle.

In Clue there are 6 suspects, 6 weapons and 9 rooms. 

Does the game still work is those numbers are modified? Like if I want to have 8 suspects instead and only 6 rooms? I would like to think the 'obvious' answer is, yes, but then again what do I know about math and game functionality....

Does the number of each category matter for the game to still work? And if so is there a certain limitation I need to keep in mind (like does one category number needs to be odd [cause 6,6,9])?

I would be very happy if you guys would help me clarify my issue :)

"For those of you who have attended a good number of board game (or nerd culture in general) conventions, are there any that you would consider good enough to travel and visit at least once?

I've attended SHUX, several PAX conventions, including Unplugged, and recently BGG.CON. I enjoyed BGG.CON in that it was less commercially-focused and all about playing as many games as you can until the wee hours of the morning. However, if you just need a sizable gaming group, it seems like it wouldn't be worth travelling, that can be had at any local convention.

One's I'm considering:

* [Dice Tower](https://dicetowereast.com/)
* [Gen Con](https://www.gencon.com/) (feels like the Holy Grail)
* [Decepta Con](https://deceptacon.werewolfatl.com/)
* BGG.CON or Dice Tower cruises (I'm not a cruise person, but would consider it)

"I am a history nerd and student. As such, Foundations of Rome really sticks out as something I dig. Not to mention, one of my favorite ways to find new games is sheer table presence. Regardless of the gameplay, you have to admit that Foundations of Rome has table presence.

My questions are: Do you think someone who enjoys a game like Ticket to Ride would enjoy Foundations of Rome? My wife loves Ticket to Ride. She enjoys games on the lighter side. If you were to look at the box, Foundations of Rome looks anything but, but my understanding is that it really isn't that heavy of a game. I understand that it is heavier than Ticket to Ride and not really the same kind of game, I was just curious what other people's experiences with it were.

Also, I was wondering if you purchase the base version of the game, is it possible to get the expansions like the Monuments or 5th player expansion later? Also, if it is possible, is there a place for all of them in the base (Senator) version of the box.

So I thought, why not make a list of games that have had enough players? I chose 20000 to be the cutoff because when I chose 30000, there wasn’t enough games to make a top 100 and choosing 20000 returned me barely 2 pages of results (&lt;200 titles) so I can weed out lower rated ones.

"I was really into boardgames when I was young- I even started my own club in high school and college to play them in the 00s. Then I got really busy and moved a lot and fell out of the hobby. But a few months ago, I happened to play Quacks of Quedlinburg at a friend's home and it was amazing! I ended up buying a copy for my mom (who plays games with her own game groups multiple times a week), and I've been catching up ever since.

And wow! Things have really changed the past 10 years. Catan was still the premier gateway when I was playing, and you could maybe graduate to Power Grid or Puerto Rico later. But now, there's been a Wingspan revolution and Mysterium is a great co-op and Azul is so good it has half a dozen sequels.

*Then* I found out about Leder Games and I may have purchased Root *and* Oath without playing either because the art and the potential just blew my mind. I have no idea who I'm even going to find to play these with me, but I sometimes just look at Oath on my shelf and sigh wistfully and my heart grows three sizes.

Inis, Spirit Island, Wonderland's War, so many more I want to try out. Then I found Shut Up and Sit Down and somehow boardgame reviews have even become art?! Makes me excited to see what will happen in the next decade (which I'll hopefully be playing along to experience).

"Hi All, It's Tom and Ed. CPO's (Chief Poo Officers) of Team About, we are about to bring you a new exciting card game...all about poo!

Big Pootential is a game all about who can brew up the biggest poo. Players take it in turns to draw food and drink cards from the pile, each card has a Pootential Factor which will increase the size of your poo. Beware however of traps your opponents may enforce upon you. Cards like 'laxative' will reduce your likely hood of winning with the largest poo. The end of the game is when you pick up a Release card, this ends your game whilst others can continue to grow their poo.

In the end, the largest poo emerges as the victor!

We are currently running a Kickstarter to help get physical cards and artwork made for the game and we’d love any donations or feedback. We really believe in this game and hope to get it out to the public in 2023!

"Inspired by /u/zoomzilla, here are my thoughts on the new games I played this year. I was able to play a lot more this year than I had done previously and have logged just over 100 plays on BGG. Here are the new games I played this year:

**6 Nimmt!…** I really enjoyed this, very simple but exciting game. I really like the simultaneous play and it can run quickly even with many players. I’ll be breaking this out as a filler/introductory game pretty much anywhere.

**Ark Nova…** I only played this once (at 4 players), but I had a good time. Before playing I had heard people criticising the game because of the swinginess due to your starting cards, and I can definitely see where they’re coming from. I had a few cards that synergised in my starting hand and I was able to play them all by the end of the game and I came in at second place. There are lots of systems in the game, but none of them are too overwhelming. The action selection is a fantastic mechanism and made the puzzle shine. Less player interaction than I would like, I felt like the only avenue where I needed to pay attention to the other players was acquiring partner zoos.

**Barrage…** I only played this once, this time at 2 players. I think we might have also accidentally played on the 3-4 player map because the building and water management side of the game didn’t feel that tight. I was able to make a network and run it, my opponent was able to make a network and run it as well. The real tightness came on the worker placement board, especially the action to generate power. I would definitely play it again at a higher player count as I can see that the shared infrastructure will play a bigger role.

**Betrayal at House on the Hill…** The definition of a Marmite game. If everyone buys in and gets involved with the story then it will be a laugh, but I can imagine if someone is in a grump then the fun will be ruined for everyone. I had fun with my one play of this, and the short playtime means that it doesn’t outstay its welcome. Much like other story based games, the novelty and seeing what haunts are in store make the game interesting for me. Once I’ve played this a couple more times I think I’ll be done with this.

**Century Spice Road…** When I first played it I loved this, such a quick and simple engine builder. I played it a bunch on BGA subsequently and the sheen has gone a bit. I would play it again in person, but I’m not rushing out to play it. For context, I’ve not played Splendor which CSR is often compared to.

**Cockroach Poker Royal…** I am a fan of most bluffing games and this one is certainly one of them. The objective of avoiding picking up means that there’s no shoot the moon highs, like flipping over every card in Skull and being correct. I’d give it another go, but so far I’d rather play Skull, Coup or Liar’s Dice for bluffing.

**Colt Express…** This was hectic and chaotic with 6 players, which I think was the intention of the design. Excellent table presence and it was fun drafting actions and wondering what state your outlaw will be in by the end of the turn. I’d play it again at 4 players to see if the lower entropy makes for more tactical decisions.

**Coloretto…** Played at 3 players. I enjoyed the push-your-luck element, plus being able to track what the other players are going for. Would play again.

**Concordia…** After the first game, I was wanting to play it again as soon as possible. I found that every action feels good and that you are always wanting to eek out every bit of efficiency from your actions. The interaction with other players is great, with some positive and some negative interactions. If someone steals a spot in a city you were going for then there’s probably something else you can do. I wouldn’t turn a game of Concordia down and I am considering buying it.

**Decrypto…** I bounced off this one, perhaps because I played against quite experienced players on both times I played it and their clues were indecipherable. In comparison to Codenames I like how there is less downtime, plus there is less pressure on the clue giver. I’ll give it another chance because I think it will be better when everyone is of a similar level of competence, and I’m not that good yet!

**Detective Club…** The best part of this game are the wooden magnifying glasses. It didn’t rock my world, but I enjoyed it more than Mysterium, but less than Spyfall.

**Dual Gauge…** Probably the best game I played all year. I have been dipping my toe into train games with cube rails and some online 18XX titles. I enjoyed the decisions of how to invest, when to buy trains and where to build track. I really liked the stock market mechanics and how companies can use stock price to buy trains and token. Each of the companies having different powers gave some great initial asymmetry. The additional maps add some great sounding mechanisms (debt on Detroit, diesels on Wisconsin) and I want to try them to pull those levers. The only downside is that money isn’t provided and that the maps are paper, but I have a decent set of poker chips and a piece of Perspex to put over the map.

**Durian…** Maybe my second favourite Oink title (behind Startups). I like how the penalties change throughout the game and the tension rises. The high player count is good, would play again.

**Eldritch Horror: Under the Pyramids…** After being completely done with base Eldritch Horror in 2020 I didn’t want to play it again. The last game of it I played I felt like I had no agency and all the mysteries and encounters were ones I’d seen before. I played under the Pyramids with Foresaken Lore &amp; Mountains of Madness and the extra cards and mechanics really refreshed the game for me. The game was 6 players (everyone was quite experienced at EH), but due to the investigators we picked there were pairs who had a great synergy. This meant we all paired up and did our own things, which made the puzzle a lot more manageable and meant that during the downtime I could plan with my partner. The old one we were facing may have been a little on the easy side, but it felt good being able to achieve success quite easily! I would play again and think that the dreamlands side board looks interesting.

**Eleusis…** This card game from the maths communicator Martin Gardner was certainly interesting. Definitely an interesting concept of trying to guess a rule made up by “God”, but some of the rules my group came up with were too convoluted. The scoring was a bit arbitrary as well, but it certainly made us think!

**Funemployed…** Better than Cards Against Humanity, but that isn’t a particularly high bar to pass. The best part about this game is the work that the player has to do to make something funny, there are certain cards that might be ideal for particular scenarios but the combinations are key. I played this as a 9 player game, and it dragged massively. I probably won’t play this again.

**Gentes…** A decent Euro with a interesting action selection mechanism. You can either spend 2 time units for an action on a turn or spend one unit now and one on the next turn. Dry theme, but a fun collection of mechanisms.

**Great Western Trail…** A brilliant and exciting decision space. After a half-arsed attempt to learn this on BGA I had a great first game of GWT in person. There’s a constant tension of wanting to maximise all the actions spaces on the trail and also racing to the end to deliver to the cities before others. I played this with Rails to the North, which certainly made the delivery mechanics more juicy. Would play this again for sure.

**Hallertau…** I played this twice this year and I did not enjoy my first play of it. There were so many resources to keep track of and each of them had a shifting importance throughout the game as the cost of moving buildings increased but also different discounts came into play. I was apprehensive to play again, but I did and I had a much better time with it. I still wasn’t able to properly utilise my cards, and I think that is what I will focus on next time I play.

**Hansa Teutonica…** Fantastic game, I really like how much of a bellend you can be by blocking routes. After 5 plays I still haven’t got a good handle on the rhythm of the game, but I want to keep on playing to figure it out. I have the big box edition and I am yet to play on the East Germany or Britain maps, but I think these might be a big teach for someone new to Hansa.

**In Vino Morte…** Is it even a game? Maybe not, but I will still want to show it to people as it might be the simplest bluffing game there is.

**Irish Gauge…** The first cube rails game I played. It’s got me hooked on train games and I still find it to be a nice and light ride. When I first played the auctions past the initial one felt shallow as  cash was so tight a player with an early lead could always outbid you. Since playing it a few more times I’ve got more familiar with the deeper strategy, and how to fight when behind. I’ll be keeping Irish Gauge because even on the surface it is fun to place trains on a hex grid.

**Istanbul: The Dice Game…** I can’t remember much about this one other than I won the game I played. Even if I didn’t win I enjoyed the game, would play again.

**Just One…** Great co-operative word game and it challenges you to think outside the box. The box says it can play up to 7 players but if you have extra whiteboards and pens you could play with more. 

**Long Shot: The Dice Game…** This was a fun roll &amp; write and a good collective experience. I played this at 8 players and it was quite hectic but fun. I wouldn’t turn down a game of this.

**Lords of Vegas…** I really enjoyed this, the theme of building casinos and gambling on which ones pay out is perfect. The scoring mechanism worked really well as you need to get bigger and bigger casinos to increase your score. The downside was that I was playing with two other people, one of whom did not know what he was doing at all. I can imagine that with 4 people who are trying their best the game will be even better.

**Nusfjord…** I played this after my first Hallertau game and I enjoyed it so much. It felt like a breath of fresh air having an Uwe game with only 3 resources instead of 14! The simplicity of the resources gave me more brain space to consider building synergies and how to build a good engine for feeding my old blokes. Very good, I would play this again in a heartbeat.

**One Card Wonder…** A light, inoffensive resource management game. I am a bit sceptical that all the wonders are as easy to build, but it is fast enough that I’m not too bothered. I’d rather play Century Spice Road for cube moving and management. 

**Panic on Wall Street!…** A grail game that I was wanting to play for a while. Managed to get it to the table and it did not disappoint. Real-time games always are more stressful, but the tension of trying to close deals before market closed was exhilarating. The movement of the stock prices was a rush as well, especially as a friend had put all his money on red stocks in the first round. If you are a fan of pit then I would highly recommend. I would certainly play it again, as a manager instead of an investor.

**Pax Pamir: 2nd Edition…** My second Cole Wehrle game after Root. The complexity of systems was a lot, but I really like how visible people’s alliances and motivations were. After the first two scoring rounds the negotiation side of the game really came to life. The shifting allegiances and tumultuous board state made it a great ride from start to finish.

**Race the Rails…** I didn’t really understand the rules apart from running around the table to find the next stop, but it was very fun! It certainly felt like being at a busy train station like Euston or Birmingham New Street.

**Sounds Fishy…** Interesting bluffing game. The scoring is a bit confusing considering how simple the rest of the game is. Not the best for replayability because it is a trivia game at heart. Certainly fun to come up with alternative answers to the questions. 

**Spirit Island…** I played a 4 player game and was the Vital Strength of the Earth. I was able to remove shedloads of blight from the map which kept us healthy, but I feel like I wasn’t able to contribute much beyond that. I will play it again, possibly with a lower player count and with a higher complexity spirit, but from my first impression I am not in love with it.

**Sprawlopolis…** I have only played this solo and I have really enjoyed it. The puzzle of competing scoring conditions means that every decision is an interesting one. The combinations of scoring criteria can lead to some very tricky scenarios as well. I’ve played with the beaches expansion, and may possibly stump for Agropolis at some point in the future. 

**Spyfall…** Very fun deduction game. As the spy you are under a lot of pressure, but once you get familiar with the possible locations the scope for lying and questioning gets easier. Not my favourite deduction game, but one that I wouldn’t turn down.

**Steampunk Rally…** Kind of quaint engine builder race game, however this didn’t land for me. A key mechanic is that if you go too fast through certain terrain tiles you will take damage and have to lose parts of your vehicle, meaning that you’ll have less abilities later on in the race. My character’s ability was a shield that blocked damage, meaning I could speed through dangerous terrain and not take damage. This lead to me having a massive vehicle that could do anything it wanted while everyone else had to break their car just to catch up. I ended up winning the race but felt like I didn’t do much to secure victory.

**Stroganov…** This was a strange one because we accidentally didn’t play with any village tiles in play for the first 3 years! This meant that mounting furs was incredibly difficult to do as there were no permanent action spaces for it. The plethora of actions made for a good puzzle, and there was a good degree of player interaction. Will certainly play again with the full rules, but my initial play was still enjoyable enough. 

**Suburbia…** I did absolutely terribly at my one play of this by expanding my city too quickly and massacring my income early on. I know where I made my mistakes, so I would definitely play it again to improve upon my abysmal performance. I really like how you have points and money income as opposed to scoring fixed amounts of points for placing tiles.

**The Crew: Mission Deep Sea…** I’ve only scratched the surface of what this game has in store and I am very impressed. I like the objective drafting and the scaling difficulty of different objectives. I am looking forward to play much more of The Crew.

**Topiary..** A very pleasant hand management and tile laying puzzle. There are plenty of opportunities to be nasty to another player with a devious tile lay. It doesn’t spark the same joy as Carcassonne as the puzzle is a bit more opaque to me and I think I’d rather play Arboretum for a nasty tree game.

**Trapwords…** Great word game with plenty of jeopardy. As the clue giver you are second guessing every word you say to avoid the trap words, but there is a great feeling of satisfaction when you manage to get your team to guess your word. I played this at 4 players and I would wager that this is the best player count for the game as you can really hone in on what your partner is trying to guess.

**Tussie Mussie…** I like this light card game. The “I cut, you choose” mechanic of card drafting is juicy and makes for some tense moments. I have played the “Flower Shoppe” solo mode but wasn’t thrilled with it. 

**Werewords…** This is the game I will play instead of One Night Werewolf for player counts of 7 or more. The collective guessing and honing in on the word makes for a fun deduction puzzle for the villagers. Playing the wolf is tricky, particularly to sow disorder. I found it better to try and figure out the Seer and then guess them once the word was found. The ludicrous words are bonkers, so probably stick to easy or medium for something more manageable.

**Wingspan…** A decent engine builder. I loved the art on the cards and acquiring birds that I knew. I was so happy that I could play a card with a cute duck on it! It was a 5 player game and it dragged on far too long (around 2.5 hours). I would play this again at 3 players, but I wouldn’t seek it out. For that time commitment I’d rather play multiple light games or a meatier game like Hansa or Power Grid. 

**Zendo…** I played this after I played Eleusis, another secret rule game. Overall I’d rank Zendo much higher than Eleusis, partly due to the bidding on other people’s guesses and the tactility of the pyramids.","I played 45 new (to me) games this year, here are my thoughts",1,self.boardgames,zuan5p,EmCdeltaT,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/zuan5p/i_played_45_new_to_me_games_this_year_here_are_my/,1671891250

"So I played this board game the other day and I loved it but can’t remember the name. I went to three separate stores which sell board games (two exclusively) and they had no idea what I was talking about. So it’s a board game with the box in the shape of a book so opens like one. And it’s about a library and the players are librarians trying to get a job at the library (2-6 players) You collect cards from a pile and there are student cards, ones with brown symbols and ones with red symbols. You need 4 student cards to turn over a special card that you have used (explain in a moment) then you need 3 brown (all different) to collect 3 points and 5 red (all different) to also collect 3 points. There are five rounds worth 6,7,8,9,10 points and you pick what the other player(s) will get using red cards with points on them. There are 8 special cards 5 before you pick up and 3 after you pick up. For the 3 you can discard a duplicate give a duplicate or leave the library and take the points (most likely red) For the 5 you can set 3 cards and pick any, get rid of the brown, get rid of the red, steal a card from someone else and skip go. So if you pick and you get a duplicate you have to use one of the 3 special and once they are all used up you have to leave the library and you get no red points. Each round you get rid of all card except students unless you fleed cause of a duplicate. If you have to leave due to a duplicate and no 3 specials left then you get to flip any special card. 

Hope I explained this well and someone can help. It has been bugging me all week.

"Was just playing Betrayal at House on the Hill, and ended up coming up against an unclear game mechanic in Haunt 22, The Abyss.

Per the Haunt rules,  the Abyss collapse begins in the basement and moves through adjacent rooms, which do not have to have a door connecting them. Eventually the collapse moves up the levels and engulfs the house.

However, in our game, we had not yet discovered the basement stairs, so there technically wasn't any adjacent squares to move the collapse to the upper levels. What happens at that point?

At that point in the game, we had discovered the coal shoot and the collapsed room, and decided that those could count as ""adjacent rooms"" that the abyss collapse could move up through (since monsters are allowed to climb the coal shoot and the abyss is this haunt's ""monster"") but it certainly wasn't clear what we should do by the game rules as written.  

Has anyone encountered this in a game? What did you decide to do? I can see people also going the other way, and saying the abyss collapse gets ""stuck"" in the basement with nowhere to continue... especially if you haven't discovered any of the above mentioned rooms.

Do you guys have any suggestions?",Dungeon Crawler for Kids,1,self.boardgames,ztyr26,davidsaraiv,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/ztyr26/dungeon_crawler_for_kids/,1671846752
"Hello there! I am a female gamer active in the hobby for the last 7-8 years. I primarily play at 2 players with my husband, and all games on this list happen to be at that count. We run a board game review YouTube channel, [Board Games for Two] (https://youtube.com/@boardgamesfortwo) and enjoy games of any type! However, I do have a soft spot for worker placement and cooperative campaign games. The more thematic the better!

10. **Flamecraft** (2022) initially caught my eye with its fun artwork and unique theme. I have a tendency to lean towards the “cute” games and I was afraid that this would fall flat when it came down to gameplay, especially for just two players. I was pleasantly surprised with just how fun it is to visit shops, collect resources, and manage the town’s Dragons. I believe higher player counts would make this more challenging and I’d love to get this to the table with 3-4 people.

9. **Chronicles of Crime: London Forensics** (2018) popped up on my radar when I was searching for an escape room-in-a-box equivalent. I am wary of app-driven games simply because we play board games to get *away* from screens, but this was such a fun experience. Players work together to examine crime scenes using a mobile phone and progress through scenarios by searching for clues with unique QR codes. Each scenario connects to tell a bigger, overarching story. 

8. Adding **Dice Hospital** (2018) to our collection was the result of playing hours and hours of Project Hospital on Steam. I was itching for a good medical-themed board game and reading some reviews led me to this. Hospital staff meeples are utilized through a worker placement mechanic and “patients” are represented by dice. I am an ICU nurse and fully appreciate the thematic elements that are included in the game—different specialists, EKG monitors for victory points, blood bags, toe tags, and even a beeper for events!

7. **Welcome To The Moon** (2021) is a flip-and-write campaign adventure in the Welcome To…family of games. Players can use any of the 8 adventure sheets for a single individual game, or they can be played in order through the campaign mode. I believe this is more challenging than the original Welcome To…and the campaign aspect is thematic as you race across space to colonize the moon.

6. **Cascadia** (2021) is our new go-to gateway game. It is a tile-laying and token-drafting gem of a board game that our entire family can enjoy. Another board game with beautiful artwork, Cascadia is about building your terrain and populating it with wildlife in the Pacific Northwest.  Each animal has scoring conditions and the replayability aspect is high due to the 5 different variants for each. It is a house favorite when we want to play a quick game in our free time. 

5. **Harry Potter Hogwarts Battle** (2016) is the newest game in our collection as of mid-December. Deck-building games are not usually at the top of my list but my husband and I had a total blast with this one. We played as Ron and Hermione from years 1-7, defeating infamous villains of the Harry Potter universe along the way. The allies, items, and spells players can purchase are a joy to reveal in your deck and I really felt as if I was evolving as a character with each game. Personally, I would choose to play Hogwarts Battle over other popular deck-building games such as Dominion or Clank!

4. **The Guild of Merchant Explorers** (2022) is a pseudo flip-and-write board game in which players attempt to connect cubes to explore terrain or establish cities while completing shared objectives for victory points. It is simple yet very challenging and I know for a fact that I haven’t won a single game against my husband. Despite this, I have so much fun trying to get my cubes across the board. My only complaint: I wish it was longer! 

3. **The Wolves** (2022) is a super thematic area control game. Area control is very hit or miss with 2 players but this one features an AI that balances gameplay out a bit. I absolutely love the actions—howl at lone wolves to bring them to your pack, hunt prey if you have 3 wolves surrounding the token, score points at different moon cycles, etc. This game is so unique for area control and the fact that it worked well even at 2 was the best surprise.

2. Pictures of **Obsession** (2018) flooded my newsfeed on Instagram for months and I finally caved and purchased a copy for myself. Wuthering Heights, Jane Eyre, and Pride &amp; Prejudice are all classic novels that I love so the theme was very appealing to me. However, the rules intimidated me, I got nervous, and had Joe teach me thinking it was going to be way out of my league complicated. That was absolutely not the case! We had so much fun throwing down cards of gentry and battling for one of the Fairchild siblings again and again. I believe that you can approach each game with a different strategy since it’s a bit of a point salad. The expansion Upstairs, Downstairs is definitely on my wishlist.

1. Joe was lucky enough to snag a copy of **Ark Nova** (2021) at our local Barnes &amp; Noble at the peak of its time spent on the BGG Hotness list. I 100% believe it fully lived up to the hype. I love a good animal theme, I love Zoo Tycoon, so how could I *not* love Ark Nova? I can’t imagine playing this at anything other than 2 players, as the downtime in between turns would be far too long for my liking. I hear some people discussing the sheer number of cards available in the game as a downside, but for me it is a definite plus. I love not knowing what will be in the river next, as I feel this helps keep the game feeling fresh. This is another game with many different approaches to strategy and I appreciate the variable setup with different player boards. There are very few games in our collection where we tally up the score and regardless of the outcome I immediately want to play it again, and Ark Nova is one of them. I’m very curious to see what its expansion, Aquarius, will bring to the table. 

Thank you so much for staying with me through the end of this list (or skipping to see #1 I totally get it and don’t blame you)!

"Hi folks, I humbly ask for your help on strategies for Dune Imperium. I love that game, on paper. But I just can't seem to make any progress in it. No matter which character I choose and how hard I try, I can't win. I just played a 4-player session with Countess Thorvald and while initially I thought I had figured things out I was left in the mud halfway through and terminated, it wasn't even fun anymore. My opponents had great cards, devastating intrigues, tons of firepower, while I had plenty of water and little else. I couldn't even build a decent decks, the Fremen cards I seeked were snatched from me before I had a chance to grab them. I usually don't care about losing when playing boardgames but this felt downright humiliating. So either we simply have to accept that luck decides the winner as much as strategy does in that game... Or we don't, and then I'm asking for your tips to improve my skills. Crucial stuff, common mistakes, what to best focus on (as a non expert) ? We played with Rise of Ix for info. 

I'd be very grateful for your wise advice. I'd rather not play it again than leave another session with a sour taste in the mouth.

I am simply asking very broadly because I am interested in what is there... I am thinking about the game that could be themed around dreams and with mechanics that could use something like surrealist creation of associations. (Perhaps something like dixit or story cubes.) Yet I think it would be interesting to connect such theme and mechanics with worldbuilding or rpg elements. I imagine something like players building new worlds or waving dream realms together but in the same time somehow either competing for rule over this dreamland or journeying around the created world with their own heroes and interacting with it perhaps similar to rpg character interacting with rpg world.,What are some dream-themed and surrealist board games with worldbuilding or strategic rpg aspects?,1,self.boardgames,ztn1os,Mapafius,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/ztn1os/what_are_some_dreamthemed_and_surrealist_board/,1671816100

"Just purchased and played for the first time last night. I thoroughly enjoyed it, but had a few movement questions:
1) If I rolled a 4 for movement, can I stop after moving less spaces if I so wish?
2) Can I move to a room to pick up an item and continue moving to intentionally use that item in a fight?

"Hi all! 

My boyfriend got Splendor as a birthday gift last year and he and his friends really enjoy playing it. Now, I want to buy him something complementary for his birthday this year. I was wondering how Splendor Duel compares to the original game (people online say it is more complex and dynamic). What are your experiences and can you explain the Duel a bit more? What do you think provides more diversity to the gameplay of someone who has been playing a lot of Splendor in the past year?

"**Splendor**...  I didn’t like it at first, but it grew on me.  I like it best with three, which is a weird player count.  The theme is downright terrible in my opinion. I would rather it just be themeless game honestly.  I’ll still play this every once in a while, but I’ve learned I don’t like engine builders all that much, but if you do this is one of the most highly regarded and I suggest giving it a try.   

**Azul..**.I avoided this for too long.  Great mix of strategy, luck and skill, though I find myself really only playing online these days because setup is kind of chore and the boards are a bit fiddly. I also find that not many people I’ve played with in person have liked this game nearly as much as me.  Strangely, I don’t find myself very interested in playing any of the sequels.  

**Lost cities..**.The hype is real for two player games.  There is a lot of interaction for a two player competitive card game.  Choices your opponent makes genuinely effect you and I love the fact that you can kind of stall out the game when you want.  Every game I’ve played I always feel like I just need one more card.  It’s  difficult without being impossible and it has a great balance of skill and luck.  Even after over 50 games I still want to play.  This game has legs.  

**Kingdomino**...  another game that grew on me.  Nice, easy fun.  Anything less than four players is kinda weak though. I won’t say it’s a great game, but it’s one of those comfort games for me that I play when I just don’t want to think that much, but still want to have fun playing.   

**Sprawlopolis..**.  Great design, great reviews, but I’m just no good at these types of games.  Haven’t won yet solo or pairs.  It seems kind of impossible to me, but I’m a bit dense. Also, I’m just not into solo gaming.  

**The Shipwreck Arcana**... It took me a few plays, but once I figured out what this game was trying to do it became more interesting.   I wouldn’t take this as a party game with the family and expect it to do well, but if you have a group who likes deduction games this is a decent one.  It does lend itsself to quarterbacking, so if you have one in your group be aware.  It’s also more difficult as you add players.  Sadly, as I’ve played more types of games this year than ever before I’ve realized I don’t like logical deduction games so this one doesn’t make the cut. However, If you have a small group that likes that type of game I would recommend it.   

**Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries...**  If you like TTR and can’t get a lot of people to the table buy this game.  Such a great design and made perfectly for 2 or 3.  Great new rules really add to the strategy and theme.  It’s tough to find truly great games for two players, but this one will stay on the shelf for a long time.  

**The Grizzled: At Your Orders…** I want to love these games but it’s impossible as written and the easy rules make it too easy.  If someone can show me how to play this correctly I will be forever in your debt.

**Lifeboat**... Big nope on this one and I thought I would love it so much that I way overspent for an out of print game.  Any game where doing nothing on your turn is a good decision is a bad game. They tried to make it a highly interactive game, but the consequences of interacting are too severe.   

**Dig Down Dwarf**...the most average, kinda boring game that isn’t terrible.  Roll some dice, take some gems, drink some beer. Try not to eat the gems even though they look delicious.

**Fox in the Forest**... At first I thought this was a gem.  Turns out it got boring pretty quick.  This type of game is pretty much the reason I don’t play traditional card games.  It feels very samey in a short amount of time.  

**Fox in the Forest Duet..**.  Just a worse version of an already kind of boring game.  The co-op feels like a chore.  

**Codenames Duet**...Such a great two player representation of the full game, plus you can add the cards into your full codenames edition.  Highly rated. It’s hard to find truly engaging two player games and this one works so well.  It’s easier if you’ve played the original version, but not difficult to understand if you haven’t.  

**Skull...** It took me a few plays to understand what this game was trying to do, which is weird because there is virutally no complexity.  Once I played my first truly fun game it became a staple at parties and family get-togethers.  This is now a favorite that I’m glad I didn’t give to the thrift store.  One small gripe: I wish I could find the old Skull and Roses version.  I love the artwork of the current print, but some of them are hard to differentiate when dealing out the coasters.  The first version has fake “gang” names printed on them to make it easier and I still love the art.   

T**he Crew: Mission Deep Sea**...I’m pretty sure I’m in the minority here, but I like the first one better.  The original is quite possibly my favorite game of all time, so MDS is still a fantastic game that I love, but I don’t view it as a direct replacement for the original.  Let me be clear: this is a great game you will love if you love The Crew.  

**Trails..**. This game was not fun and I don’t get the hype. I felt like I was moving up and down the board without much choice, and the choices I had didn’t seem to be that important.  I just didn’t see anything unique or interesting about this game.

**Coloretto..**. very simplistic game. No real decision making.  Sadly, fewer players is better as it allows you to actually do a bit of meager planning, but it’s still a boring game.  I love simplistic, elegant design, but this misses the mark.  I feel like this is good design poorly implemented.  There has to be a game out there like this, but more stable and strategic, but with a good deal of luck that scales well with more players. If you know of any let me know in the comments.  

**Cloud city**...  Great idea that doesn’t pay off.  It’s just boring to play.  Solitare game and I would never want to play the physical version with all those light, tiny, plastic pieces.   

**Quacks of Quedlinburg.**.. Maybe I’m just high on Quack, but this is a great game.  Complex enough to play many times  and simple enough to get going on the second play.  It has a catchup mechanism that makes poor players think they’re in the game even though they’re not. This is great for me because I usually lose. Great theme and components that match.  My only negative is that some of the books aren’t great.  I’d rather just pull out random books.  Also it finishes at 45 min once you get it internalized.  

**Lost Cities roll and write...**  Another good representation of Lost Cities.  A decent amount of intensity, choice, and player interaction- at least for a roll and write.  This has grown on me and become a really solid choice, but it’s really only good for three or four players, which gets downgraded for me.   

**Welcome To…**  My first flip and write.   It works very similar to the roll and write’s I’m accustomed to, if a bit more complex.  After a few games I started to internalize it and I’m happy with the variation provided by the more complex choices.  It’s a solid game that a lot of people like much more than I do.  It’s fine, but   it fills the same roll as some others that I like better.   

**Burgle Bros 2.**..  This is one of the more complex games I’ve played(as I said I don’t get very complex). Setup and takedown is a chore.  This is one box I actually wish was bigger so I could just throw all the pieces into sandwich bags and call it a day.  Getting it back together is like putting together a puzzle. Anyway the game…is really fun and engaging.  The basic premise is pretty easy to pick up after one play and there is an option for legacy play, which adds some replayability.  I will mention that at the end of the game the act of trying to stay away from the bouncer without anything left to uncover feels a lot like a chore.  

**Cross Clues.**  This game was pretty bad and my group loves word deduction games.  It has very little structure and feels a lot like a party game for kids.  There’s no real point system or penalties for wrong guesses.  Quite frankly, it doesn’t even feel like a game.   Not only that, the 50’s theme is tacked on for no concievable reason.   

**Herrlof--**  I’m constantly on the lookout for games great for two players and even with the lack of truly good options, this one doesn’t make the cut. There’s nothing really exciting or unique about this trick-taker.  With all the other options this one belongs on the heap.   

**Can’t Stop…**I like nothing better than simple, elegant design and this fits that description.  In fact, you could play this game with a piece of paper and a few pennies if you want and I find that somewhat endearing.  It’s a great push your luck dice roller, but my only complaint is that three players is pretty much the only count I want for this game.  I’ve done it with two and four and neither option is very appealing.  At least for me, it’s difficult to find exactly two other people to play a game with, so as much as I like it this will probably remain an online  only game for me.  

**Colt Express…** I could only give a couple plays to this game.  It’s quirky and unique, but I didn’t find myself wanting to come back to it.   

**Twin Palms**… I’ve cooled on this game considerably.  It plays well with odd player counts, which is nice, but I don’t think it’s doing anything special that most trick-takers haven’t already done.  I do love that you play two cards on each trick and it offers a way to play at several different levels of complexity.  Don’t get me wrong- I like this game, but the market for trick-takers is so crowded that I would choose several others over this.  

**Sharp Shooters…** This was a thrift store find from someone in my play group and it turned out to be a surprise hit.  It’s a dice rolling push your luck game and what I like about it is the fact that you don’t really want to use your dice to start the scoring, only to end it.   There’s virtually no strategy, its basically just rolling dice and hoping for the best so it’s not going to make any top ten lists, but it’s a solid party game.  As a bonus, you don’t need the rolling tray that it comes with so it becomes much more modular if you want to take it on the go.  If you end up playing it often you can upgrade the cheap plastic coins for good poker chips to feel like a real high roller.   

**Camel Up**….  This is a skillfully designed betting game.  It’s mostly luck based, but the game gives you a feeling of agency through several options on your turn so it doesn’t feel like you’re doing the same thing every turn.  It’s broken up into several separate legs as well, so it’s not just the final outcome you are betting for or against. The fun of seeing your chosen camel getting out in front and the anguish when it lands on a -1 is laugh out loud fun.  Best part is this game is fun as hell with four, five or six.  This hits the table nearly every game night and it’s the first game we introduce to new players.   

**Nope..**.This is an interesting concept- kind of a reverse card shedding game where you want to be the last one with a card still in hand.  It’s easy to learn and there are some interesting cards that provide a wrinkle in the game to keep you guessing.  It’s not amazing, but I won’t turn down a game.  My favorite thing about this game has nothing to do with gameplay though.  The card stock is the finest of any game I’ve ever played.  They feel bomb proof. I play a lot of card games and if every one of them decided to make a new version with these cards I would re-buy every one of them.  The colors are intense and a bit gaudy for my taste, but it’s a game built heavily around color so they did a great job with the components even if the colors do burn out my rods and cones.   

**Fleet the dice game**… If you like roll and writes this game lives up to the ratings.  It’s complex enough to offer several paths to victory, but easy to internalize after a couple plays. The theme is well connected to the mechanics and it plays quickly even with the max of 4 players.  It’s become one of my favorite roll and writes and gets lots of play with my regular group.  

**That’s pretty clever**… I could almost write the same thing here as Fleet.  Several paths to victory and elegantly complex.  It’s abstract so if you need theme I would go elsewhere since there are so many options, but this is a shining example of the genre that I think everyone should have.  It’s an instant classic that will be fun forever and a great introduction into the genre.   

**Hanabi…** I didn’t find this game as inviting as a lot of people.  It’s a neat concept with players not being able to see their own cards, but there is a fine line between playing as a beginner with other beginners and moving on to games with experts.  It becomes a game of strictly observed nuance that I find off-putting.  Playing in person can be frustrating if not everyone is playing like an emotionless robot, but if you’re casual like I am and don’t care to enforce those strict rules then you gain too much information from reading your teammates and the game is too easy.   

**Cartographers**… It’s inclusion on most of the top roll and write lists is warranted.  Interesting Tetris like mechanism and a decent amount of player interaction.  It’s replayabilty suffers in my opinion because their aren’t enough scoring cards.  After only a few plays you’ve seen them all multiple times.  I’ve purchased most of the expansions, which gives you new maps and some new perimeters to work within, but almost no new scoring cards.  I wish the expansions came with at least 4 new ones.  Bonus points for being just as good with two players as it is with five.  

**Lowdown**… Interesting little roll and write that reminds me a lot of Sudoku.  Nothing that’s going to get a ton of good reviews or show up on any lists, but it’s solid. Bonus points for utilizing tiny dry erase boards instead of a clump of paper.  

**Downforce**… This game has a devout following, but I couldn’t get into it.  It feels pretty bland to me. You play a card, some cars move, the game is over.  I’m sure there’s a lot of strategy and great design that I’m not seeing, but after about ten plays I’m still not having fun.   

**Roll for it…** This is fun filler.  Even as someone who plays almost entirely filler games, this is filler even for me.  It’s kind of mindless dice rolling without much strategy, but I won’t turn down a game and it’s good for new gamers.  

**Tranquility**….This game seemed like a winner to me until I played it several times.  It’s one of those co-op games that’s more difficult than fun, but if it were easier it wouldn’t be fun.  I’ve played about 20 games and never won.  Every time is very close though, it keeps you thinking you might be able to win.  If I played with the same people every time, soon enough we’d solve it and win. It’s at that point that the game loses all interest for me.    

**Twice as clever**… A really great follow-up to That’s Pretty Clever.  It adds just enough complexity to differentiate it from its predecessor without making it overly complicated like...

**Clever Cubed**…. Which is pushing the boundaries a little too far for me.  It’s clearly meant for Clever masters. Try explaining this game to someone unfamiliar with the other two.   

**Sushi go party…** This is a great game that has it all.  A little strategy against a little luck.  Player interaction that is cut-throat enough to be fun without being rage inducing.  Their are enough menues to give it a ton of replayability and you don’t even have to use the provided menues.  If you make your own it still works perfectly.  My only gripe is setup vs. game time.  It takes a few minutes set up and a game only lasts about 10 minutes when everybody knows how to play.   

**Liar’s dice…** Solid casual/family/drinking game.  My group enjoys this game when new people who aren’t that familiar with board games show up. Or when we’ve had a few drinks.  My only gripe is that the dice rattling in the plastic cups is deafening.  We play it enough that I bought quiet cups.  

**Castles of Burgundy dice game**… In my search for the best roll and writes this kept appearing on lists throughout the internet so I gave it a good try.  I can see how others would like it, but it just fell a little flat for me.  It’s not a bad game, it’s just that there are a bunch of other roll and write’s I’d rather play. I don’t think it’s just me either.  I’ve played with several different people and no one has asked to bring it back to the table.   

**Splito**…I’m kind of pumped to see this get an english language release(hopefully this year). A very interesting semi-cooperative card game where you have to cooperate with the players on your left and right in order to meet certain conditions, while also competing with them for total points.  This may be the game with the most player interaction I’ve seen.  That interaction should be much more fun in person than it is on BGA, but it’s still a great online game.   

**Tournament at Avalon**…This has turned into one of my favorite trick taking games.  It’s almost entirely luck based and super swingy so if that turns you off don’t play this game.  The way this game can take you from first to last is devastating and for me that swingyness is really fun.  It also has a lot of player interaction in the form of forming loose alliances or ganging up on the leader.  This is a love or hate game that I personally love.   

**Long shot the dice game…** After seeing a lot of great reviews for this game I was highly disappointed. A game simply doesn’t last long enough to build any of the strategic options given.  They are all highly intriguing choices, but none of them can be filled out in the one lap provided.  I’m considering adding a house rule of two laps to see if it makes a difference.

**Roll and bump…**This has become without a doubt my favorite dice roller.  Yes, it’s luck based, but there is definitely a good deal of strategy as well.  Bumping your opponents feels incredibly good, and getting bumped sucks.  There is more than one way to play and win this game, which gives it a ton of replayabilty. I think this is just a better version of Yahtzee.  I’m so hyped that a new version is being printed this year and I’m pretty sure it will show up at every family get-together and game night for a while.   

**Pumafioso…** A great trick taking game with a little more strategy than most.  Simple, clean, elegant design from  Reiner Knizia in a small box.  It took my group a few plays to come around, but it paid off and it now hits the table most game nights.  

**Yinsh**… I haven’t played a perfect information 2 player abstract in ages because I don’t like them.  I got this one because I thought my wife might like that kind of game and Yinsh is one of the highest rated 2 player abstracts of all time.  Tough decisions, planning your attack and defense, and thinking two steps ahead are all required by this very well designed game that lives up to its ratings. I will play this game until one of us is overwhelmingly better than the other at which time I will lose all interest and never want to play again even if I’m the better player.  If you like 2 player abstracts and haven’t tried this one it’s probably a must buy.  

**Gang of Dice**… This is a great little dice roller that pushes the limits of push-your-luck. Not only are you rolling against the perimeters on the cards, you are also rolling against your opponents.  Another clean, elegant design by Knizia.  Unfortunately this game isn’t being sold in the US yet.  I hope that it’s inclusion on BGA signifies that it will soon be released here.

**Jekyll vs. Hyde**… After trying a bunch of two player trick takers I may need to entertain the idea that I may just not like them as much as I would like.   It’s a good game, but like most in this category it doesn’t have legs.  I played this game about a dozen times and after that I could put it away forever and never shed a tear.  I don’t know why, but there’s nothing bringing me back to this style of game. 

**Ready, Set, Bet**… This falls into the same category as Camel Up in terms of the excitement and panic that a race brings, yet in a much different way.  It’s the closest thing to actually betting at a horse race I’ve ever seen and it’s brilliant.  There are several varieties of bets that gives this game a lot of replay value. An instant classic for my group. We’ve never used the “house” scorekeeper and always use the app so that everyone can play, which I highly recommend.  

**Bandada…** A great game for two that my wife and I are loving.  There is a lot to keep track of due to how the game is scored and trying to keep track of your own ever-changing score and your opponents’ is challenging and fun.   

**Caper: Europe**… Another great two player only game.  The constant push and pull within this game is fantastic.  You are constantly trying to maintain dominance over one place, while trying to stop your opponent from gaining a foothold anywhere else.  The card buying mechanism is also great and makes you manage your resources or go broke, leaving you unable to buy anymore gear or thieves, which you are always in desperate need of.   

Piraten Kapern…  Nothing special with this one.  It’s a push your luck dice roller with no player interaction.  The addition of cards that dictate what you want to roll and the possibility of losing points gives it a bit of depth, but it’s a party dice game.  I would argue that it’s a one for one replacement of Farkle so if you like Farkle you will probably like this better.  

Green Team Wins… A fun party game much like Just One, except the opposite.  You want to have the most popular answer at the table.  There are three categories of simple questions that everyone has to answer and the most popular answers get to be on the green team, which is how you score points.  It’s great to have a game like this that plays up to 9 and is simple to learn, fun to play.",I played over 50 new(to me) games this year.

"A few hours ago  [u/Ready-Appointment228](https://www.reddit.com/user/Ready-Appointment228/) posted about solving an [original pawn variant chess game](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/ztabww/i_solved_my_own_board_game/) played on a 5x7 board.  I created it in TTS to see what fixes could be made to it, but I think it might be unfixable without major changes.

However using the premise, and then a suggestion by [u/pidaysock/](https://www.reddit.com/user/pidaysock/) to include the en passant rule in chess, I concocted a version that might work better using a standard board.  The player who moves first is forced into allowing an en passant capture to start the game and it proceeds from there. The first to get a pawn into the opponent's back row wins. 

You can try it on TTS or at home since it uses a standard chess board(there is nothing to print other than the rules).  If you don't have 32 pawns laying around, I think you could easily play 16 pennies vs 16 dimes and use nickels(or just squares of paper) as blocks.

"Some card combinations and sets can be utterly broken if certain combos go off early in the game by dumb luck. I'll step out a detailed example below if anyone is interested. How do people deal with this? Do you restart or persevere? Do you abandon silly sets and try something else entirely? Do you call a truce to not exploit the cheese? We (2p) love the game but both hate it (win or lose) when this happens to us. We find it totally unfun and quit. Just wondering what other folks think of this.


Example - *Stoneground* with *Guilds/Cornucopia* and *Dark Ages*:


Both players take *Procession* and *Marauder* on first cycle (using starting coffer from *Baker*).


Player 1 lands the *Procession-Marauder* combo and Player 2 does not. Player 1 upgrades trashed *Marauder* to *Rogue*.


Both players buy a *Candlestick Maker*. Player 1 diversifies and buys a *Plaza* while Player 2 buys a second *Marauder* to increase chances of a combo with *Procession* to catch up.


Player 1 plays a *Procession-Rogue* combo, gaining their trashed *Marauder* and attacking Player 2. Player 2 reveals their only *Spoils* which is discarded and a *Marauder* which is trashed. Player 2 trashes the *Rogue* upgrading to *Hunting Grounds* and buys a *Gold* with x2 +2 money from *Rogue* and 2 *Coppers*. 


Player 2's next turn is *Procession* with no other Action cards and 4 *Coppers*. Player 1's next turn is 8 money with 2 *Spoils*.",How do you deal with broken luck in Dominion?,1,self.boardgames,ztcbjb,PortOfRico,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/ztcbjb/how_do_you_deal_with_broken_luck_in_dominion/,1671792108
"So there are three types of helpful players

Players who are only helping you, because they hate the fact that you're too easy to beat. As soon as they realize that your brain just doesn't work that way, and that you will never be a optimal player, they get resentful at you for it. These are the players who will give microaggressions in their body language and facial expressions. These are the players who will tell you that they didn't like the fact that they had to mentor you, because their mentoring never led anywhere. No offence but as soon as I feel like a group has these ""helpful"" players then I want to leave the group, partly because I hate the atmosphere and also because I know that getting kicked out will be inevitable. It is highly unlikely I will ever be able to play optimally. 

Players who are helping you in the hope that you will get better. They might part ways with you, because your play style doesn't mesh well with them. But they will never make you feel unwelcome while you're at the table. They will never regret the fact that they helped you. Sure it didn't go anywhere, but they hope that what you did learn from them will give you a better platform for the next group you find. I don't mind these players on a personal level but on a ""looking for a group"" level, if ,and if being the key word here, most board gamers are like this, then it makes it hard for players who can't play strategically to find a long term group.

These next group of players are my favourite. You can never be good at board games, and they will give you advice and help for however long is required. They are the type to nurture and support. They value your personality over how you play.","Thank you to the experienced board gamers who love helping ""forever suck at board gamers"" just for the sake of helping",1,self.boardgames,ztawqj,Apprehensive-Date181,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/ztawqj/thank_you_to_the_experienced_board_gamers_who/,1671786628
"Maybe about two months ago I created what is essentially a pawn variant of chess for the sake of a simpler but complex and hard to analyze problem that I could solve using an AI. It was meant as a long term project whilst I learn to code but now after lots of playing what felt like an unsolvable mess turned into something very predictable as in play patterns are very similar now.

 It used to feel very abstract and now I’m almost bored by it because it feels too simple. I don’t really want to complicate it too much or add any other pieces but I’m not sure of a more elegant way to make it fresh and unknown again. If anyone has any ideas I’d really appreciate hearing them! 

(In case you want the rules to try out for yourself) 

It’s played with only pawns on a board that’s 5x7, each player has two rows of 5 pawns and they can’t move forward more than one space but still capture diagonally. The goal is to get one of your pawns to the end of the board. If you cannot make any legal moves then you just pass your turn. If neither play can make any moves then you each count up  the total squares traveled by your pawns which are still on the board including the back rank. Then whoever moved the farthest wins(there can be draws)",I Solved my own board game,1,self.boardgames,ztabww,Ready-Appointment228,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/ztabww/i_solved_my_own_board_game/,1671784386

"I found a copy of Betrayal Legacy that looks like it was taken through 40% of the game. I spent the time removing all the stickers and putting them back so I have a full sticker sheet. All pieces accounted for. The Folium is complete (I can ignore stickers in the rule book until I've 'unlocked' them and the only other item unlocked is the ghost stickers which are all complete).

I really enjoy games that handle mystery like Mansions of Madness or Chronicles of Crime but I've noticed that some scenarios in Mansions spoon-feed you the answer if you find a certain clue. The Museum scenario is a really good example of the kind of mystery mechanics I'm looking for.

"I used to love Miniature Market, but thanks to these past two months, I have warned all my fellow DM's about the potential hassle they will have to go through to get an order from Miniature Market. 

It all started when I decided to make a Black Friday Sale purchase from them. I order two miniatures, a Wizkids huge fire elemental mini, and an Omnath mini. Everything was going fine, the shipping took a bit, but I was expecting that since they are moving warehouses and it's the holiday season. However, I was not expecting to receive a small box from them that only had the huge fire elemental mini in it, there was not even room for the Omnath mini, so I was very confused about what could have happened. I tried to call them though out the day during their business hours, but not once was I able to get someone to answer. Feeling defeated, I left a voicemail and sent an email, and waited a few days until I got a call from them. I explained that I had purchased the two minis but only had one delivered. They told me the item I had ordered was out of stock and there was nothing they could do but refund me. 

Why is it that they would take my money and deliver the one mini knowing that they will not send the other mini and wait days to get back to me for me to tell them this, and THEN they offer a refund, not when they realize the item was out of stock! Thankfully I got a refund, and I was also given a response from the email an hour after they called with a $10 in-store credit added to my account for getting back to me so late. Now I wouldn't be making this post if that was the end of it.

I wasn't thrilled with the outcome, I still wanted the Omnath mini, but I was ok with it. So I decided to use that $10 in-store credit they gave me and ordered a pack of Wizkids 15 1-inch mini base plates from Miniature Market. In the end, I only had to pay around $1.40 out of pocket. So another week went by, and I noticed the tracking for the package of the mini base plates was showing up as 3.4 pounds. At first, I was confused about what could be the reason, but I thought that they had added the Omnath mini to my order after all. Well, I get this large, heavy package, and I open it to find... a Wrath of King's game rules book. Oh, and the best part is that the Wizkids 15 1-inch mini base plates are nowhere to be found. So I tried to call them again, but I knew their tricks by now and left a voice mail immediately and also sent them an email as well. Later that day, I received an email saying they would work on it, and that was it. A week later, I have not had an update whatsoever and can not get a hold of them. 

This is a warning to all those purchasing from Miniature Market to hold off from buying from them and support some other miniature selling companies. I have started my search looking for a new place to order all mine from and would appreciate any suggested online stores.",Miniature Market has let me down yet again...,1,self.boardgames,zt1fv0,Ezi0_,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/zt1fv0/miniature_market_has_let_me_down_yet_again/,1671754525

"Hey so, this is me sort of seeing if there's a way out of this. I apologise if this comes across as emotional (it is) but I just got absolutely demolished and I am about to throw my towel in for this whole damn hobby.

*I'm really bad at board games****.*** I've been playing for years, almost two decades, and I've been part of several clubs. However, as far as it goes, I've never managed to win a single round of any game on my own. Co-op games are fine, but anything pitting me by myself against one or more players results in me losing. I'm always feeling outmatched, slow and generally dim-witted. I'm at least good enough to not let it get to me then and there, but generally after two hours I'll politely excuse myself - pretending that I'm ill, got a phone call or am tired.

I honestly don't know what to do. Board games are the one thing I got to socialise as I'm too fidgety for movies and I don't really do small-talk so I've tended to default to something like Settlers of Catan or Pandemic to liven up my meetups, but I've burned through so many games that I kept being terrible at that I just don't know what to do. I can't even beat anybody at checkers, *checkers*.

I don't know what's wrong with me, or if there are any tricks for my brain to start working properly. I feel as if I am always banging my head against some wall that none of my friends have trouble handling, and I don't have anything else to do.

Is there something that I can do? Is there a technique, something I could learn? Am I too slow to play board games? 

I can't buy any new games at the moment because I burned my money on Scythe recently...and now I don't even want to play that anymore.

Things I'm almost certain of:

Things I think I remember:

A few different things could be on each planet? (Resources? Information? I think it was only 2), the players had a limited amount of ships to go to a planet, each player had a secret condition to get points/win with?, the scorecards had something moveable on it? Maybe health or something with ships?, there might have been a ""sacrifice this resource in order to get something"", there might have been dice?

"So I’ve been playing the Hans scenario regularly as it’s the only one I have at this time. I’m wondering if I’m doing something wrong as I feel the gameplay always devolves into me and Hans just standing in one place attacking each other until one of us dies from bad dice rolls. 

My usual gameplay consists of sprinting around the board searching for items to get a couple power ups and saving all the victims as quickly as possible to minimize the blood lust going up as well as getting the rewards on my final girl and triggering her power. So before I know it it’s just me and Hans on the board and I have nothing else to do besides stand there and have a back and forth fight to the death with him. Occasionally an event will add more victims to the board but not often enough to make it a big deal to have to worry about them.

"I posted the following as part of a comment about biggest peaves in games and thought it warranted a post of its own. 

I was wondering whether anyone else has found their gaming group becoming toxic and/or effecting their mental health and how they deal with it.

I often find that people undermine and disrespect me. I have a friend who is arguably more into boardgames than even me. However, he has a tendency to undermine me and/or the game while we're playing. ""Please win so we can all go home."" ""When will this be over?"" Are just a couple of examples of the types of thing he'll say. Normally, on the run up to a games night we'll be messaging each other about the game(s) so I know he's excited to play but then he acts like that. I find it really annoying but feel like if I call it out, I'll be the bad guy for not taking a joke or something like that.

I rarely win at games because I'm just not very good at them. I'm not really competitive; I just enjoy playing the games as a fun thing to do with friends. I don't really care whether I win or not. BUT. More &amp; more recently, a few of my group make jokes about how I'm bad at games and if someone wants an easy win, they should just play against me. I can normally take this in good humour but over the last few months, it's started to wear me down a bit. 

I think the biggest thing for me is sort of two-pronged. I'm almost always the one who has to arrange games nights for my group of 20+. As much as the others enjoy them, no one else initiates a games night. It's always me. The guy mentioned in my previous paragraph, who undermines me, will sometimes arrange something but I normally have to prompt him. Couple that with the fact that members of my group have absolutely no hangups about dropping out of a games night, sometimes last minute, for no real reason and it really gets to me. 

I hosted a game of Blood on the Clocktower on my birthday and one member sent me a voice note ONE HOUR before the start to say she wasn't coming because she'd forgotten about it. 

I use an app to arrange all our games nights, which tracks attendance and sends reminders etc. Quite often, people don't even have the decency to respond at all. They'd just rather leave me wondering whether they'll turn up. I actually find it really upsetting. I open my home to people so they can meet &amp; play games for free (all our lgs's charge for tables) and they completely take me for granted. 

I don't mean to sound dramatic but it's been damaging for my mental health so I'm trying to create a little distance at the moment. I'm likely moving 150 miles away next year and quite honestly, all this has made it a lot easier to make that decision.

Anyway, I'm curious whether anyone has faced similar and how they cope?",Toxic Gaming Groups,1,self.boardgames,zsl9lx,Ok-Masterpiece-8311,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/zsl9lx/toxic_gaming_groups/,1671713055

TI4 - there’s not enough sci-fi nowadays and the TI universe is well developed enough that all the different factions in a war could be cool to see on the screen. Probably too big for a single movie tho, would work better as a tv show.

Spirit island - a young native is forced out of her Sagan by colonists and must find and evoke powerful spirits to drive them off.

"Hi there,

  
I originally got my Dinosaur World game and the box was weirdly dinged in it, the bottom was crinkled like I hadn't seen in a box before, I contacted their support and they refused to send a replacement box and said it was a shipping issue.

I recently just came across another person selling the game from KS and he complained in the post that it came with a weird ding.

"1 person picks a card with a question, like ""what would you like to do on a rainy Sunday"". The other players have a little writing pad and write what they think player 1 would do on that rainy Sunday. Then all answers are revealed. Now player 1 picks the best answer for her from those and marks the selection with a little round plastic gadget, called something crazy like ""spiromat 2000"", other players can't see that selection yet. Each of the other players has two tokens, and now they put those at the answer which they think player 1 has selected. After revealing everything, people get points for matches.

"If you own more than 20 games, you’re probably already starting to feel like your collection of getting a little…overwhelming. (Or maybe you don’t feel this way and that’s cool too. Stick with me here - I’m building up to the question.)

So what is your current criteria for acquiring games? Is it an impulsive/immediate bar (“if it looks good, I buy/back it immediately”), or are you a more patient gamer (“I’ll wait a year to see how this game shapes up and then decide if I want it”). Or maybe your criteria is more based on available shelf space. Or funds. What’s your decision process for spending money on board games? And what motivates that decision. 

For me: I need to make sure that a game is great (not just very good. Like it needs to really stand out and stand the test of time). So I’m usually willing to wait a while before jumping in. I’m not a reviewer or board game influencer so it isn’t important to be on the bleeding edge of new games. I need to keep this high bar so that I can work my way through my huge unplayed collection.

"Context: I am interested in playing Cthulu: Death May Die and currently own NO content. Fear of the Unknown (Season 3) is currently available on Kickstarter for Late Pledges.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to parse through the differences between the retail versions and Kickstarter versions in an attempt to decide what to buy (and from where). Below is my understanding based on my research, please correct if I'm wrong and let me know if you have some personal suggestions for me!

&amp;#x200B;

**Cthulu: Death May Die (Season 1)** available at Retail is the core box only. If you had backed on Kickstarter you would have had access to the Unthinkable Box, which is the name for all of the stretch goals. The Unthinkable Box is not available via retail and as such is not easily available, but IS available for $120 as an add-on to the current kickstarter.

&amp;#x200B;

**Cthulu: Death May Die Season 2** is an expansion for the base game. Kickstarter version and retail versions are identical. Season 1 (base game) required to play this content.

&amp;#x200B;

**Cthulu: Death May Die - Fear of the Unknown (Season 3)** is currently on Kickstarter. If you back via Kickstarter, you will get the Unknowable Box, which contains all the Kickstarter stretch goals. Later, assuming this comes to retail, you will only be able to buy the core box.

&amp;#x200B;

**Cthulu: Death May Die Season 4** is an expansion for EITHER the base game (Season 1) OR the Fear of the Unknown (Season 3) box. If this comes to retail, it will be nearly the same as the Kickstarter version, minus 3 cards (a Bracelet item, a Relic card, and an Insanity card). Probably minimal reason to buy this via Kickstarter and instead should wait for retail if I like the game.

&amp;#x200B;

Clear as mud, eh? I believe I have a couple paths forward, for the C:DMD experts among us, I'd love some suggestions:

Option 1: Buy the base game retail for \~$90 including shipping. Get the base game and don't worry about any of this extra content. The cheapest option.

Option 2: Buy Season 3 via Kickstarter, which is standalone and includes the ""Unknowable Box."" Don't worry about buying the base game.

Option 3: ""The base game + Unspeakable Box is absolutely the best way to play this game."" If that's the case, the only way to do this effectively is to back Season 3 via Kickstarter and add-on the Unspeakable Box for $120.

"First of all I'm from Europe, where the game was never officially released, but a whole bunch of chinese copies are available due to the makers having released the grapic files for the game.

I recently bought a used copy but didn't like the condition it was in and bought another one. This one arrived in much better condition, but I was also surprised to notice a seemingly higher production value and was wondering if this is actually an original copy.

Just like which pretty much all components, the colors on the box appear richer and more saturated:
https://i.postimg.cc/V6LJyLDs/IMG-2867.jpg

The manual shows the biggest difference, being bound much nicer and in multiple languages.
https://i.postimg.cc/HkvYJ42m/IMG-2871.jpg

Again, the colors on the cards are much richer and more saturated. They also feel slightly nicer, appearing to have a light linen finish on them.
https://i.postimg.cc/pdQsGk6b/IMG-2873.jpg

The envelopes are slightly thicker and sturdier:
https://i.postimg.cc/766S3VvN/IMG-2875.jpg

The inlay is matte instead of glossy, also feeling just a little thicker:
https://i.postimg.cc/vT88gPpQ/IMG-2876.jpg

I actually like the wooden signs better in the other box though. They are very slightly thicker, more congruent and have a nicer wood pattern. I'm thinking of mix-matching them, but would kinda like to keep the original box intact if it really is original:
https://i.postimg.cc/D03jBH2T/IMG-2874.jpg

The back of the box had these stickers on them and I'm not sure what to make of them. I can't scan the first one and entered the code on the second one, which said invalid. That may be due to this being a used copy though.

"Hello there fellow boardgamers, me and my gf just have a bunch of new games this Christmas/Birthday (also December!) and they are:

Saboteur, Chambers of Wonders, MYSTERIUM, Nemesis Lockdown, Galaxy Trucker

(I think I'm OK until next winter as I like to play games a lot before buying new ones :D)

Now, I really dislike Cooperative games but I find the Mysterium theme, art and ruleset really appealing. I actually gifted Mysterium to my girlfriend as she has always been interested into it for the art and theme mainly.

These days we'd like to play the game with family/friends but I'd really prefer to have a competitive variant.

So my question is, do you have some home made or semi official rules for competitive play?

I was thinking at the following:

Mediums correctly guessing the right murder story wins

The ghost wins if at least half+1 of the mediums correctly guessed the story

&amp;#x200B;

So you could have 1 medium winning, or 2 winning and everyone else loses, or 4 wins together with the ghost and 2 loses, etc. This also should give to the clarvoyance tokens more importance IMHO?

&amp;#x200B;

Do you have any other advice? I think the above should work on paper, but maybe is going to break some mechanic/equilibrium ruining the game? Please let me know :)",Competitive Variant for Mysterium?,1,self.boardgames,zrld6b,Buon_Costa,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/zrld6b/competitive_variant_for_mysterium/,1671628289

"The full the Top 11 are:
1. Endless Winter: Paleoamericans
2: Flamecraft
3: Mosaic
4: Ready Set Bet
5: Foundations of Rome
6: Wonderland's War
7: Skate Summer
8: Tenpenny Parks
9: Revive
10: Heat: Pedal to the Metal
11: Planet Unknown

For context as to how I came to this list, I looked through the individual Top 10 lists from their recent 'Winter Spectacular' and compiled the lists together. I gave each game a base score of 100, plus points for the position in the list, i.e. 101 for number 10 and 110 for number 1. Then added all the scores together. (Giving them all a base score of 100 means that a game that appears at number 10 on nine lists will score higher than a game that appears at number 1, but only on one list )

There were 16 lists that I could find, so a potential total of 160 unique games, but only 83 games were mentioned in the lists. Only 22 games actually appeared on more than one list, showing the range of tastes that were covered in this lists this year.

Some other interesting things I can see are:
- Endless Winter topped the chart mainly because it appeared on the most lists (8).
- Five people had number one games that didn't appear on anyone else's lists at all.
- Out of everyone, Mike Dilisio, Wendy Yi, and The Brandt all had Endless Winter as their number 1 game of the year. 
- Creature Comforts is the only game to appear in the 'People's Choice' and not on any other list.

Obviously this is all subjective to the people who did Top 10s for the Dice Tower, so shouldn't be classed as any sort of 'Best Game of the Year', but thought it might be interesting for other people, not just for me.

One thing I did find interesting, is I think down to the timing of game releases and these lists. Originally I had just compiled the list based on the 'main' lists (i.e. those will an hour or more section given to them), but then realised there were further lists hiddent in other streams that I could include. Once I had added these in, comparing the lists meant that Mosaic rose from number 11 to number 3, and Heat fell from number 4 to number 10 - which I think may be because it was only released in October so outside the main studio people haven't had a chance to play it as much. I suspect the same will be the case with Wayfarers of the South Tigris as well, at the minute it only appears on three lists, but it ranks highly in those three lists, so I think it would have been near the top of the list (currently in 12th, as the highest game only appearing on three lists) had more people had played it

Anyway, I've linked to the full spreadsheet with my workings on it so you can see the full list if you are interested.",The Dice Tower's Favourite Game of 2022 is: Endless Winter: Paleoamericans,1,docs.google.com,zrl07r,lowej004,0,https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IF1hNvosn8tqmRx6mAR_LcMx-3uQmlH7fkmkyBVnFD0/edit?usp=sharing,1671627719

"I make foamcore inserts, but I recently had a chance to try out a laser cutter. So I took advantage of the opportunity and am really glad with how it turned out. The laser makes light burn marks on the wood, so there was a lot more sanding than I expected. Also, sometimes it didn't make 90º cuts. I think this is because the wood bowed a bit. Next time I'll use smaller pieces that will lay flat. But the wood, rather than foam, looks so good with this game's theme.

"Just wondering what is your 'If You Could Only Play 10 Games For Entire Year, What Would They Be?' - Expansions still count as a single game. Below is my list, and I hope other people will join in! I know it's holiday time and we are all busy, so if you don't have time to give a reason for why, you don't have to! This is a list just to see what people are playing, how they can be entertained for a year, etc. 

My list goes from lightest to heaviest games. You can do your list in any way you'd like. Right away I want to say that IT WAS  a difficult decision because there are about 10 more games that I wanted to include, but I just did a pro/con of the games and came up with the following list. 

**• 1. Just One (1.05/5.0 - 3-8 Players, Party Game) - This game I played quite often and when you have 6-8 people, most of the time they just want to shoot the shit, have a lot of laughs, come in/out from the game as they wish, and something that plays quickly, many times, with minimal rules. 


• 2. The Quest for El Dorado + Expansions (1.92/5.0, 2-4 players, light euro) - Truth be told, I never played this game at 2 players, only 3-4 and it is always a lot of fun! Base game has so much replayability with modular maps, fan made maps and your own made maps. With the other 2 Expansions it adds even more replayability. It's light, it's easy to explain, there is thinking but not much to cause analysts paralysis. I saw a post on BGG someone combining two games together and doing an 8 player game. Map looks like a rotated '8' multiple a few times. Sounded good but because of how the firet player token works, there will be times where you'll wait 15 TURNS before your turn. Nightmare. At 3-4 the game is amazing. Playing it once a week for a year and you can't get bored. You'll forget just enough so the game will be new to you.


• 3. Turing Machine (2.43/5.0, 1-4 Players, Brain Teaser) - This is a new one to the collection but so much fun if you are into THIS style of games. I feel like people that like Sodoku (not necessarily all puzzle games) will like this game. You can play solo, you can play up to 4 players, I think I read somewhere that it has 100,000+ combinations so I doubt you can get through entire game in one year. Great for solo plays, and great for groups. Fairly easy to teach and for sure scratches a certain puzzle itch. Definitely watch a few videos before thinking of getting it because I don't think its for everyone.


• 4. Mansions of Madness, Second Edition + Expansions + Fan Made App (2.67/5.0, 3-4 players, never ending co-op) - Including a co-op game into this 10 list was a must. Something with a bit of magic, a lot of mystery, light decision making, amazing voices and music from computer, maps changing if you lose, etc. If you actually decide to play the next level only AFTER you beat the current one, with all the expansions there is no way you'll finish it in a year. Shortest game took us 60 minutes, longest one took us 9 hours. The range of this co-op is amazing.


• 5. Hadrian's Wall (3.12/5.0, 1-6 Players, Solo Game, Roll &amp; Write) - I think at this point most people figured out that Hadrian's Wall is an amazing Roll and Write game. First, I think it might be the most complicated Roll &amp; Write? Second, it's TWO MASSIVE SHEETS of stuff that you can tick, cross off, and write. Two. Sheets. For the entire game you're playing with your head down. Which is why I think people place it in the solo category because there is no talking in this game. Even if you wanted to. Entire process is you thinking about what to do. With that being said, if your group is okay with this and you won't feel awkward then absolutely play it with people! It's a brain burner for sure, but it feels really great to work on it and complete it. Next time playing it you can try to beat your previous score.


• 6. Chain of Command + Expansions (3.23/5, 2-6 players, Rule Book, Miniature WW2 War Game) - I love this game. Not only that, it has won wargame of the year in 2022 (this year!). With all the expansions you absolutely will need a few years to finish everything. It's a sandbox game of its own where you can create scenarios nonestop. 1v1, team versus team, it's all possible. Two memorable moments come to mind right away, first one being using a machine gun from a hill and keeps spraying at an enemy that is far away only to get the gun jammed and them attacking me with an airplane. Another one was when I was in perfect position to ambush, threw 12 dice to see how much would hit them, and they were all misses. Epic moments in these games. But that is war. It's not predictable and that is where dice home in. You need to be a good commander to figure out what to so with the troops and weapons you have, not what you wish you had.


• 7. Hellenica: Story of Greece + Expansion (3.36/5.0, 1-7 Players, 3.5x Game) - 3.5x and not a true 4 because while you are exploring, the game is made up at the start of every game. So yes, it's new and different, but it's pre-made. The solo mode with bots is amazing, it's not an afterthought, it's emphasized as bring a game with great bots. Also, it supports 7 players! Such a unique niche. A 3.5x game that supports this many players. The miniatures are awesome, replayability is endless, the powers, the events, the skirmish, it's all awesome. I also like it that it does take 3-5 hours to finish it. You can really dive into this and make your decisions count. Who are you attacking? Who are you teaming up with? Tons if decisions.


• 8. Agricola + Farmers of the Moor + Additional Decks (3.49/5.0, 1-6 Players, Medium Euro) - Some, or most, people might hate this game at 6 people, but I absolutely love it! Once everyone plays a game or two, it plays fairly smoothly with enough downtime just to think of 2-3 moves that you can be making during your turn. With all the decks, I don't think it'll ever play a game that is identical to a previously played game. You can get a fairly nice engine running. Sometimes cards don't play in your favour, but that is okay! You just need to figure it out! It's punishing, it's mean, and I love it. Plus the 3D Printing potential for it is nearly endless!


• 9. Sidereal Confluence + Expansion (3.55/5.0, 6-9 Players, Heavy Multi-Hour Negotiation Game) - I don't even know how to describe this game. Imagine playing Chinatown, but now you can only open your stores when you have goods inside the store, but you need to buy different sets of material from other people to make that good sonic can be sold. Who are you selling it to? To other players of course that need to to craft their goods. It's asymmetrical, it's long, it's a table hog. People dedicate their entire gaming experience to this game, there are tournaments for this game. It's as good as it gets when it comes to negotiating. I hate the space theme. HATE IT. But the game is just so damn good. Not for everyone though so please watch TONS OF VIDEOS.


• 10. Trickerion: Legends of Illusion + Expansions (4.24/5.0, 1-4 Players, Heavy Euro) - I think tackling one heavy Euro a year is enough. The amount of rules you need to remember, the amount of stuff you have to do every turn, it's a lot! Then, what if your friends don't know how to play? Which most likely they don't. The teaching is a drag. But the game is amazing once everyone is comfortable with the rules! PLUS MAGIC!! You just a nobody magician starting put giving shows in the back ally on a Tuesday afternoon and build yourself up to David Copperfield style performer giving sold out shows on Saturday evening with the most complicated illusions. Such an amazing theme. Wish more games went this route. Maybe I'm just a sucker for magic, illusions and Harry Potter lol.

"This was a recent meet-and-teach with 3 players. The game's owner was teaching the rules to one player completely cold and one player with a Youtube watchthrough under their belt.

The game is an ambitious title, combining several subcategories of game mechanics. Each player starts with a number of leaders, usually 2 to begin (although you can sacrifice mook followers to gain new ones), and can assign them to one of about six different commands, shown by their civilization card. Unlike Race for the Galaxy or Puerto Rico, there is no ""piggybacking"" off of another player's choices.

The commands include: Territory Control mechanics over a map of Europe/Mediterranean; Worker Placement mechanics, choosing which territories to cultivate and defend with your population; Military conflict mechanics (where bespoke dice determine which sides suffer casualties in a round-based resolution); Tech Advance mechanics (term ""Improvements"" in-game); and Morale (similar to the attitude mechanic from Scythe). I understand that the game has a Diplomacy mode as well, but at 3 players we did not examine this in great detail, beyond the useful ""don't attack me or you lose a lot of Morale"" submechanic.

A lot of the mechanic effects have good thematic synergy. Build too many cities and you'll find your people getting lower morale, due to the logistical problems of administrating them. Hire too many leaders and you'll find yourself with too few mook followers to do the mundane tasks.

The aim of the game is to push victory points to the top by the time the end turn is known - and as with many Euro style games, there are a number of different sources for VPs (as well as several different game-ending conditions). VPs can come from hidden/public objectives, scoring military victories, researching certain techs, building cities, and so forth.

Territorial expansion involves movement counts, land/sea distinctions, and collectible luxuries or other resources when you claim a map region. Non-contiguous land regions under your control count as a Colony, imposing a one-time Morale hit at time of formation.

The military mechanics rely heavily upon bespoke dice faces, and they were my first experience with this type of resolution. Upon declaring battle, both sides immediately tally up four metrics, including a Tech subcategory, Morale bonus, and Strength (numerical superiority), claiming a combat token if they ""win"" in that metric. Defender wins ties if the battle is on land, Attacker wins ties if the battle is by sea. Each side rolls a die which has identical custom facings, and usually boils down to 1/6 attacker loses a unit, 1/6 defender loses a unit, and 4/6 depends on who claimed the war token of the same matching die face at the start of combat. Various territory-based resources like Horses and Ore can influence this; it's also sometimes possible to pay into a ""bank"" of military units which can be deployed ahead of crucial battles.

Leaders can initiate Trade, which generates a small bit of income plus any bonuses from Luxuries. Or, more drastically, they can Tax their populace, which generates income very quickly but also inflicts a massive Morale bonus.

Leaders can bestow Bread and Circuses upon their populace, which regenerates Morale (moreso if Luxuries are available).

Finally, the Leaders can also instigate a Revolution, which typically requires some stiff milestones to be met throughout your civilization, and this then pushes your civilization up through the epochs like an Age in most Civilization-alike games. The first to age up gets to claim a faceup objective card for immediate VPs. More generally, going up an age tends to bring you immediate and recurring benefits. However, going up an age also immediately ends your turn and gives all defenses a -1 for the rest of the turn due to internal turmoil.

How it plays:

I happened to play as Egypt, which occupies the southeastern corner of the Mediterranean map, and I played this nation both times. The first game, the other two rivals were Gaul and Iberia, far away on the other side of the map and largely unable to interfere with my own civ management - the first game went to me by a fairly broad margin, even given my lack of familiarity with game mechanics, because the other two competitors were busy sparring with each other.

The second game, we specifically chose a more equilateral map disposition of Iberia-Rome-Egypt, and this time all players did get involved in PvP combat. With greater experience, the game score was more even, although certain objectives certainly appeared to be ""tiered"" in ease of completion - the ""Rich"" objective, especially, seemed like something that any single player could fairly easily meet in most games (if the objective is secret) simply because the Tax and Trade income can be dramatic with even a single leader activation.

Comparisons:

Compared to Scythe, EoT has mechanical downsides (as well as obvious upsides) to deploying tons of workers. Also similar in that Morale is important, affecting all combat and most territorial movement. Combat is much more abstract in EoT, with no distinction beyond ""land unit"" and ""sea unit"".

This game also has a touch of Fantasy Flight Games' ""kitchen sink"" mentality with different available dimensions of the game mechanics (many of the cutthroat PvP mechanics will be familiar to players of Game of Thrones 2nd Ed. or Twilight Imperium). With a half dozen main commands you could issue, and then often times several sub-flavors of those commands at your disposal, the first game will likely become an exploration of the possible game orders rather than directed efficient play. Later runthroughs get better, and the learning curve is surprisingly forgiving for a game of such mechanical detail.

We played about 7 hours in total, finishing two games. At 3.5 hours for a three player game, this compares favorably to Twilight Imperium 3/4 and perhaps similar to Eclipse. (I could imagine it will take longer at higher player counts - since there is no piggybacking, a player has not much to do when it's somebody else's turn.)

Version notes:

The game designer has released some updates and tweaks - each player board, for example, had some stickers over the Diplomacy command to reflect rebalanced mechanics, as did the main game board's Tech tree. Apparently these were made available for free to players who'd backed it on Kickstarter. A future updated version is apparently doing the rounds in conventions where the designer is present and soliciting feedback.

I found this game overcame many of the common problems I had with Euro games, while oddly introducing a couple that I usually associate with American style games. I don't think it's hooked me enough to buy it, but I do look forward to getting more plays in with a larger player count.

There are jokes about Gauls and druids and magic potions. Most of these went over the heads of my American friends.","Had a recent meet-and-teach to learn to play Era of Tribes.

"Can you reasonably rate a game a 10 even though you rank it below an 8 or 9?

Could you have a game in your top x, that's rated a 7 with an 8 ranked below it?

For example, I have the Crew rated at a 10 because I believe it excels at what it does, but there are many 8s or 9s I'd rank above it or pick to play over it.

Conversely, I don't think I'd rate Betrayal Legacy higher than about 7 because the game is a little too random and non-structured for my tastes, but dang it did provide some incredible and memorable experiences...so id consider ranking it above some games I have rated higher than a 7.

Obviously these processes are subjective, how do you think these two systems are related?

# Ahoy

ARRR!!!! With the release of both Libertalia: Winds of Galecrest and [Ahoy](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/359402/ahoy) this year, I’ve certainly gotten into the pirate spirit (apparently the [1400 other pirate games](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamecategory/1090/pirates/linkeditems/boardgamecategory?pageid=1&amp;sort=yearpublished) failed to get me in a piratey mood).  Where Libertalia captures more of the backstabbing greed of piracy, Ahoy leans into the high seas adventures.

As is Leder Games’ trademark, there is plenty of asymmetry to be found here. 2 factions — the Bluefin Squadron and Mollusk Union — compete with each other to control region tiles while two other factions act as pickup and deliver smugglers. 

Rounds proceed with players rolling their 4 or 5 dice and then taking turns to assign dice to actions on player boards. Your board actions allow you to sail around, load your cannons (in preparation for battle), repair your ship (clear action spaces that get blocked by damage tiles), and utilize unique abilities. You can also recruit more crew members from islands — in essence adding powers and actions to your growing card tableau.  

As promised, Ahoy is much more streamlined and easier to get into compared to Root. The rules are simpler, the asymmetry is lighter, and the game is supposed to be quicker (although I will note that both of our plays went beyond 90 minutes, certainly a bit longer than ideal for this weight of game). Overall, there’s a refreshing brevity to the turn-by-turn gameplay.

The map starts out with merely two region tiles, and players can voyage off in any direction their seafaring heart desires to create a unique sprawl of ocean features. Each region comes with its own value die, and that value may gradually increase if smugglers decide to deliver goods there. 

As the region dice spread outward and tick upward, the big dogs of the sea begin to salivate for control. The Bluefin Squadron spreads patrols and erects island fortresses while the Mollusk Union gathers and deploys comrades. Positioning their faction pieces is key to success, as each region will grant points equal to its value to whoever controls it. 

While the two heavyweight factions spread far and wide, the smugglers are simply looking to weave in and out of islands as quickly as possible with their precious cargo. Encountering enemy ships can sometimes be a great inconvenience — forcing the active player to stop dead in their tracks because somebody loaded their cannons and is looking for a fight. Of course, the smugglers have cannons of their own and a victory in battle can result in a lucrative reward from their player board.

The smugglers aren’t completely disinterested in the area control war, though.  While they aren’t competing in it themselves, they are placing bets on it. Each card of cargo that gets delivered becomes a pledge where the player secretly tucks it under a Bluefin or Mollusk token. This is a chance to score bonus end-game points if the bet was correct (who controls the islands which match that card’s suit?). This may even persuade a smuggler to help out the faction they are invested in for specific regions.

Like any deeply asymmetric design from Leder Games, there’s a lot of interesting stuff going on here… and just as much potential for one player to have a great experience as another has a rough experience. Leder is not the type of publisher to sell a game with guard rails — there is ample opportunity for opponents and luck to rain on your pirate parade. But there is also a lot of freedom to chart your own course and explore the wacky possibilities.

I’ll be honest, I came into Ahoy excited but apprehensive. The concept and presentation were thrilling to me, but it certainly has some big shoes to fill as a follow up to the likes of Root and Oath. Thus far, I’ve been able to try both the Bluefin Squadron and Smugglers. In both cases, I had a grand old time. The Bluefin Squadron felt like a great territorial tug-of-war with those pesky Mollusks. The Smuggler felt more like a slippery troublemaker who doles out bruises and bonuses in equal measure. The crew cards I’ve recruited have also played a significant role in my strategies thus far and been key contributors to my success.

The fact that I can essentially play 3 refreshingly different versions of Ahoy (based on my faction) with impactful crew specialization on top of that makes me eager to set sail once more.

**Prognosis: Good**

# Orleans

*2 Plays (4 Players)*

My first taste of the legendary [Orleans](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/164928/orleans) actually came in the form of trying its spiritual sibling, Altiplano, over three years ago. That play feels like it was from another lifetime, probably due to the fact that I’ve played hundreds of other games since then and because it was in the before times. But I still recall feeling incredibly underwhelmed by Altiplano due to a sloppy rulebook, long playtime, and dearth of player interaction.

Here is what I wrote about Altiplano after giving it a go, “My major complaint would have to be the nearly complete lack of player interaction. 99% of the rounds could be played simultaneously, yet that 1% outlier situation keeps you from doing so and thus extends the length of the game even more.  When a non-interactive game can last nearly two hours with only two players, at that point I would just rather play A Feast for Odin (which provides a far more satisfying resource conversion Euro experience).”

So that predictably killed my interest in trying Orleans. But I’ve since had the opportunity to play a friend’s copy of this game twice (once last year, and once again this month), so at this point I might as well give my proper first impressions.

The good news is that I find Orleans to be better than Altiplano. The bad news is that I think it’s only marginally better. It still checks my main complaint of being largely solitaire with just enough interaction to noticeably slow the game down without providing genuinely meaningful or satisfying interaction. At the very least, Orleans mitigates this issue better by having a cleaner system and faster pace than Altiplano.

On top of that, where Altiplano is invested in bland resource conversion, Orleans is more interested in engaging engine building. In Orleans, you’re essentially drawing workers out of your bag which can be assigned to their matching spaces on your player board to earn you more workers, increase the number of tokens you can draw each round, and create new action opportunities and discounts on your player board. As you build your bag and improve your board, you’ll feel much more powerful and flexible in later rounds which makes for a satisfying arc.

The game board also provides plenty of tracks for players to advance up as well as many flavors of points to collect from money to goods to citizen tiles. It’s a clean system with a variety of strategies to explore, so I can see why it’s popular. Back in 2014, when it initially released, its bag building mechanism was certainly more novel and fresh. Its success has likely served as inspiration for many bag builders since then, which is perhaps both a compliment and a curse. With bag building being more common and familiar nowadays, Orleans has perhaps lost some of its novelty and uniqueness. For me, the game feels largely similar to many other Euros I’ve tried, to its detriment. But it still provides a solid engine building experience.

*Prognosis: Fair*

# Kabuto Sumo: Total Mayhem (Expansion)

https://preview.redd.it/hbv7gsegp27a1.png?width=336&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=49d4eb62b767f550cd343aa46c57f68158b8233a

***7 Plays (2 Players)***

I recently categorized Kabuto Sumo as a Lover in my recent [Revisiting the Best Board Games of 2021](https://bitewinggames.com/revisiting-the-best-board-games-of-2021/) post. The brand new expansion, [Total Mayhem](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/360715/kabuto-sumo-total-mayhem), has been a great reminder as to why we love getting this game to the table.

Where the base game offers a wide array of asymmetric characters with delightful names, charming illustrations, and amusing abilities, there was already plenty of variety in the box to keep me happy. Total Mayhem doesn’t just take the setup combinations to infinity and beyond, but it also adds another layer to the gameplay. 

The first expansion — Insect All-Stars — already added 8 new characters to the mix, so Total Mayhem instead focuses on introducing new modules to the experience. This latest expansion comes with 8 double-sided Total Mayhem cards — each having a Match side and an Item side. The match side generally introduces an additional winning objective to the session. You can always still win by knocking out your opponent or forcing them into submission (when they run out of pieces in their inventory). But now with Total Mayhem you can play with some wild goals like:

* If you push your torch piece to the dead-center of the ring, you win the match
* If you cause the table to collapse, you win the match (this one features an elevated rectangular block resting on two legs)
* Knock the guitar off the ring twice to win (each time it gets knocked out by a player, they must push it back into the ring on their next turn)
* Drop 16 little thorn pieces onto the ring at the start of the game and lose the match if you knock out 4 or more of them

We’ve enjoyed the added dimension these cards bring to the strategies and tactics of this simple dexterity game. You’re constantly scrambling for the easiest path to victory while dancing around the slippery slopes to defeat. But a match card isn’t the only thing you add to a session. True to its title, Total Mayhem also has you lay out an item card to contribute to the chaos.

These items basically act like a shared signature move that any player can utilize. Some items are earned through stacking pieces, others through inventory payments to opponents, and yet others through knocking out enough pieces on your turn or none at all. Kabuto Sumo definitely shines by mixing up the shapes, sizes, weights, and physics of its disc-pushing mechanism — keeping things weird and wacky from one play to the next.

It’s clear that the creators of Kabuto Sumo and its expansions have had a blast with this charming dexterity game. From the unique challenges that each new card offers to the hilariously epic items and illustrations that bring its theme to life. While this expansion certainly ramps up the mayhem and speeds up the game, it’s not likely to change anyone’s mind. If you enjoy Kabuto Sumo like me, then you’ll find more to love in this latest expansion.

**Prognosis: Excellent**

# Carcassonne: The Castle / Zamek

https://preview.redd.it/50xu3aaip27a1.png?width=419&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d650bef17cf94b016b91381d8b48b5c35754cb2b

*2 Plays (2 Players)*

Carcassonne is as classic as board gaming gets and one of the few transcendent titans of the industry that has remained in my collection.  Where Catan was replaced by Concordia and Bohnanza, and Pandemic was replaced by Pandemic Iberia and Siege of Runedar, and Monopoly was replaced by Chinatown and Lords of Vegas, and Jenga was replaced by Crokinole and Men at Work, Carcassonne has remained protected from my culling wrath.  That may change now that I own [Carcassonne: The Castle](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/7717/carcassonne-castle).

My favorite way to play Carcassonne has always been at 2-players. With Carcassonne: The Castle, Reiner Knizia comes in as a guest-star designer and gives the core premise a heightened 2-player focus.  Players are no longer restricted to connecting matching edges (fields to fields, city to city, etc.), instead they are restrained by a surrounding wall which serves as the game boundaries. 

The wall introduces many interesting dynamics to the Carcassonne experience.  For example, it can serve as a boundary to your ambitiously large area—one or more surfaces that you don’t have to worry about enclosing with a different type of terrain.  With the starting tiles printed around it, the wall also allows players to spread inward from multiple areas rather than be stuck in one place.  Finally, the wall serves as a score track with every rook along the wall containing a bonus tile; this bonus tile is awarded to the player who gets their score marker to stop exactly on it (passing over the bonus tile means you don’t get it!).  

Where vanilla Carcassonne sees players lunging for any and all points as quickly as possible, The Castle unveils a tactical layer by encouraging players to score specific amounts of points at specific times along the score track.  Suddenly the perfect tile to enclose a point-scoring area may come at an inconvenient time (when the points don’t line up with the next rook along the score track).

The tiles themselves also feature some twists to the formula.  Roads are still here (and still must connect to other roads or the wall), but having one or more stocks along a road will double its points. Pigsties score 2 points per tile (Pigsties are found in the version I’ve been playing—Zamek).  Houses only score 1 point per tile, so not as good as pigsties on their own, but the player with the largest housing area at the end will score points equal to the largest empty space within the wall.  So if a player knows they won’t win the housing competition, they must try to cut down on their rival’s points by dividing up the empty space before the tiles run out and the game is over.  Scoring the largest empty space is yet another genius use of the enclosing wall.

All of these twists add such a scrumptious tension to the solid Carcassonne formula.  Should I wall in my opponent’s growing pigsty by placing this field tile next door? (remember, you are allowed to mismatch edges here) Should I enclose my house area now to guarantee myself the points and leap frog over the valuable bonus tile in the process?  Should I add a stock to this road and put a big target on it for my opponent to go after?  These considerations and many more are found throughout the game.  

Carcassonne: The Castle is such a brilliant little 2-player game that it makes me wish Dr. Knizia would do more all-star team-ups with other beloved classics.  What would Reiner’s take on Pandemic look like? I wonder…

**Prognosis: Excellent**

# Wormholes

https://preview.redd.it/xru6e75kp27a1.png?width=598&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c106c93ecf8433b756cfd1e9b8bab742a9b8628

*2 Plays (2 &amp; 4 Players)*

I can still recall the buzz around [Wormholes](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/350689/wormholes) when it was first announced. The very title of the game eluded to the exciting possibilities: that of a shared board morphed and transformed by players into a tangled web of interconnected wormholes. It simply made sense and tickled the imagination.

So how does Wormholes deliver on that thrilling promise? In many ways, it does exactly what it promises to do. Ships start with the energy to move three measly spaces through an enourmous, hex-based galaxy. But players can drop wormholes around them as they please; and use of those wormholes — blipping from one end to the other — requires no energy at all. Thus, the game contains a nice arc of starting with meager movement turns and ending with elaborate orchestrations of passenger pickup and delivery.

You’ll not only plan and use your own wormholes, but you’ll also integrate opponent wormholes into your navigation. And if your opponent happens to drop a wormhole in a smart spot, then they’ll be raking in the bonus points as every use of a wormhole by an opponent nets the wormhole owner a point. Those bonus points are important to keep in mind, but the meat of your points come from actually transporting passengers to their desired planet.

Based on what cards enter your hand (or the open market), you’ll adjust your tactics to milk the most delivery points out of each turn. As the game progresses onward and the wormholes spread far and wide, what initially seems impossible or inefficient can suddenly become solvable and smart. The advanced side of the space tiles also add satisfying depth to this route-planning puzzle — where an orbit zips you around a planet, nebulae similarly offer a free ride, wild wormholes are free game for anyone, photon cannons launch you in a straight line as far as your heart desires, and black holes teleport you away according to the whims of Lady Luck. 

By harnessing the great anomalies of space along with the man-made wormholes, you’ll be able to weave together some satisfying space-traversing combos. Unfortunately, the creativity and joy of Wormholes both starts and ends at exactly that: movement efficiency. 

For some folks, a streamlined pickup and deliver puzzle is all it needs to be. We showed Wormholes to a very casual gaming couple and they had a blast with it, even stating afterward that they could see themselves buying it (I don’t remember them saying that about *any* of the other *many* games we’ve shown them — so kudos to this game). 

For other folks, perhaps those more like myself, Wormholes might feel a bit 1-dimensional after a couple plays. You’re trying to navigate and deliver to 8 or 10 different planets during the game, but those planets might as will be called “Point A,” “Point B,” “Point C,” “Point D,” etc. Each card is simply a 2-point objective telling you “Deliver me to point \_\_\_.” You’re not so much explorers of the final frontier, rather Taxi cabs performing repetitive work across a vanilla solar system. Although being a Taxi cab sounds much more interesting, as you’d actually get to meet wildly different and interesting people and be rewarded equal to the distance you transported them. In Wormholes, an inconvenient card that enters your hand is nothing more than a faceless passenger who makes you curse your poor luck of the draw and plan to cast them aside on the very next turn.

I guess what I’m trying to say is that beneath the interesting efficiency puzzle of Wormholes lies a largely flavorless experience where the only thing of substance is the next hit of points. Trash cards, draw cards, move, deliver, deposit points, rinse, repeat. It’s clean and polished, for sure, and precisely as lengthy as it should be.

Wormholes somehow makes the most boring part of space (floating through it) the most exciting part while making the most exciting part of space (the diverse planets and life) the most dull part. And although it provides a shared map that allows players to punch a ton of space/time holes in it, the game surprisingly feels like a solitaire top-decking efficiency puzzle with some incidental interaction rather than a strategic tussle of the galaxy’s greatest minds. Whether that’s a good thing or not will depend entirely on the gaming group.

**Prognosis: Fair**

# Space Worm

*3 Plays (2 Players)*

Speaking of worms in space, let’s talk about [Space Worm](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/265293/space-worm)! This relatively new Knizia roll &amp; write (from 2020) saw a limited release by a UK publisher, and I couldn’t help but purchase a copy when I spotted one in the US BGG marketplace. While it certainly is a title within the very genre that I have largely disowned, it is also a design inspired by the retro video game Snake, and that sounded pretty cool.

In Space Worm, 2-6 players take turns drafting a die from a pool of 8 total. These are six-sided dice with the 6th face being replaced by another 1. When you select a die, you must draw a straight line on your dark space paper (using a bright metallic pen) that is equal in length to the value of the die. Each time you choose a new die, you can of course continue in the same direction or take that opportunity to make a left or right turn. And as all good snakes know, you can never crash into your own growing tail.

Each player’s hungry space worm is eager to swallow all the fruits and planets spread out across their paper. The more planets you swallow, the less negative points you’ll be penalized at the end of the game. Meanwhile, the fruits are a light competition between players to swallow all of one type first. The first player to swallow all the strawberries will gain 4 points, the next will get 3, the next will get 2, etc. If you happen to swallow a fruit with a matching color die, then you’ll even gain a bonus point. The game also includes 4 unique maps with different arrangements and neat little additions like super fruits and wormholes.

Finally, each time you are unable to use one of the available dice from the pool (because you would crash into a wall), you lose a 2-point life. Once a player loses all 4 lives (or eats all the fruit) the game is over.

So it’s an interesting mixture of route-charting, objective racing, and dice drafting. One feature of Space Worm that you don’t normally expect from a roll &amp; write is that of brutality. Particularly at lower player counts, it’s easy to keep a trained eye on what your opposition desperately wants from the dice pool and hate draft it away from them. Where the difference between first and second place in fruit claiming is only ever a single point at 2-players, it is fortunate that the focus shifts away from the immediate fruit nabbing and toward the full-round dice planning.

Much like the best moments of Azul, you’ll study your opponent’s objectives, line this information up with the drafting options, and puzzle out the best drafting decisions and plans for your own needs. There’s a zesty back and forth tango to it all. As the drafting options dwindle, players will be relieved when a new round finally starts with all 8 dice being rolled again and the 1st player marker passing clockwise.

Long-term planning is vital to success in Space Worm, because if you corner yourself in a risky area (where your only option is to draft a low number or lose a life) then you might find yourself careening toward a premature game end. In our first game, my wife and I stayed fairly even until she started the round with a new dice roll and (against all odds) didn’t roll a single 1 (the only result that could get her out of a tight corner). Suddenly, all of her carefully executed plans along the way didn’t matter and her full supply of lives quickly vanished.

In fact, that’s sort of how every game has ended thus far. The extra little points we sweated and scraped for along the way ended up not mattering all that much because one player eventually trapped themself and destroyed their score. I’m still not sure whether that kind of conclusion is fully satisfying or not — one person’s worm suddenly combusting into an absolute dumpster fire while the other person looks on in gleeful pity. But I suppose the ending might feel more competitive with more players; and it’s not too big of a deal anyway when the game is so fast.

Space Worm starts out open and free, but over it’s 20 minutes you’ll quickly feel the noose tighten around your slimy neck. The game ever entices you to make a risky turn for just one more point, and your opposition will always be waiting in the shadows for that moment where you slither just a little too far. Because it combines the worn-out roll &amp; write formula with some spicy push-your-luck worm traversal and much-needed bitey drafting interaction, this one has the potential to keep growing on me.

**Prognosis: Fair**

# John Company: Second Edition

https://preview.redd.it/zitpwtjop27a1.png?width=760&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bff932f43beae00bf0913fe5d18b1b4e4e0ba9d6

*2 Plays (4 &amp; 5 Players)*

I was listening to a recent interview of Cole Wehrle (designer and publisher of [John Company: Second Edition](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/332686/john-company-second-edition)) and one thing he said especially stood out to me.  In essence, he stated that many game designers fall into the trap of optimizing their game for the first play rather than for returning players. They work to flatten the mountain when they should instead seek to smooth the ramp. 

This statement rang true for me because I’ve seen it in so many modern publications. Hard lessons are replaced by soulless bonuses, clever complexities are cast aside for wooden approachability, guard rails are thrown up at every dangerous corner, and emergent explorative depth is sacrificed for a carefully controlled agenda. But if there is any game which is optimized for *returning* players rather than the first play, it’s John Company: Second Edition (and all of Cole Wehrle’s designs, for that matter).

As its title suggests, John Company the board game offers a deep dive into the political workings of the British East India Company — greed, grime, and all. Unlike many of our hobby’s Euros which glaze over the horrors of history and merely use such convenient settings as rose-tinted wallpaper, John Company charges straight into the belly of the beast of imperialism and globalization. Here, players are actually given a peek behind the curtains of careless greed, and they’ll come away with a better understanding of what John Company did to countless victims and how those in power were complicit in enabling its moral crimes.

As a mere essay on history, business, and social science, John Company: Second Edition is a fascinating creature. The fact that a board game can provide such an immersive, enlightening, and introspective experience is proof enough that this hobby is as much an art as it is a form of fun. But John Company manages to conjure two miracles in one by being both historically illuminating and thoroughly entertaining.

As the first page of the rulebook states: “In John Company, players assume the roles of ambitious families attempting to use the British East India Company for personal gain.” It also spends an entire page hammering home the point that this is a negotiation game, through and through. That is a very important point to remember as one gets lost in the weeds this procedural roller coaster.

Of all the Cole Wehrle games I’ve played (Root, Pax Pamir, Oath, and now this one), it certainly seems like John Company required the most effort on my part to learn and understand before the big teaching session.  I spent hours in preparation — reading through the rulebook, watching an entire teach and playthrough, and then reading through the rulebook once more. Being the designated teacher of John Company to a game group is like preparing for a final exam — you better know your stuff or you’re in for a rough one.

Despite the fact the Mr. Wehrle puts all of his optimization eggs in the repeat plays basket, that doesn’t mean that this game isn’t approachable. From the gorgeous game board organization to the carefully crafted cards and aids to the warm welcome sheet to the starting scenario, you can tell that Wehrlegig Games cares as much about constructing a smooth ramp as they care about preserving the mountain of strategic possibilities. And what a freaking mountain this game is.

After only playing the starting scenario a couple of times, yet spending roughly 6 hours exploring its depths, I feel like I’ve only scratched the surface here. There are yet more events in India to face, more British laws to consider, more offices and roles to explore, more cunning strategies to uncover, and that doesn’t even touch on the advanced scenarios featuring deregulation and a completely different side to the player boards. John Company takes the concept of “replayability” and punts it into the next dimension.

On a basic level of gameplay, players proceed through a set number of rigidly structured rounds unless the company fails, triggering an early game end. You’ll spend your energy jockeying for positions of power within the company, often bribing or blackmailing your way into office, just so you can rake in the financial gains and swaddle your family members in point-scoring luxury. The goal is to generate opportunities for retirement and betrothal, all while fueling these opportunities through your wealth and success.

The path to victory is through the various offices and roles of the East India Trading Company. The chairman greases the cogs of the system by allocating finances to the various treasuries. The Director of Trade positions writers and ships and sends special envoys to prepare the company for action. The Manager of Shipping fits, buys, and leases ships to enable trading across various regions of India and Asia. Military Affairs organizes the officers and commanders of each army, who deploy like a tyrannical plague on the map. The Presidencies oversee trade in their areas to help keep the company thriving. The Prime Minister reveals policies and proposals to be considered and voted upon. 

Through both the inner workings of the company and the politics of hiring replacements, all of these offices and roles are deeply intertwined, making for a rich playground of negotiation. The company is far bigger than one person, and its survival hinges upon the cooperation of everyone involved, including Lady Luck. Much of what players will aim to accomplish within their various roles requires “Success Checks” — basically chucking a handful of dice and praying for at least one result of a 1 or 2. The probabilities of success, failure, and catastrophic failure are laid out plainly on each player board, and players must decide how much they are willing to spend to gain extra dice and minimize the risks.

Yet even when dice in hand are seemingly plenty, there is always a chance of failure when dealing with unwieldy India. So much of the game is about rolling with the punches and making the most of the latest mess of company problems. Perhaps your ambitious plans for trade in Bombay turned into an absolute dumpster fire, leaving your aging president destitute of retirement savings, but maybe his close relative, the Prime Minister, can pull a few strings to help him still land a place in his dream retirement home. Sure, maybe the company is sailing full-speed ahead toward a destructive iceberg, but at least you still have time to drape yourself in luxuries as you fall back on your local workshops to get through the impending economic disaster and sinking company ship.

For a game where so much of the overall outcome is out of your hands, players have rarely had so much freedom to collaborate, cooperate, coerce, and conspire. And whatever happens with the company, however the final scores shake out, the real fun will always be the coalitions that were formed, the deals that were struck, the promises that were fulfilled, and the backs that were stabbed along the way.

**Prognosis: Excellent**

"TLDR: He loves the altruistic, co-op aspects of Pandemic.  But I can’t find another co-op, non-violent, non-campaign game that’s a similar length and weight to Pandemic.  Any recommendations?

For context, this guy usually sits out when the rest of us play games.  

He avoids competition like the plague.  In Azul, I joked that he took the pieces I wanted, and he repeatedly tried to give them to me for the rest of the round).

He’s also worried about not understanding the game and slowing the group down.  My mom and I LOVE Search for Planet X, but this poor guy had no idea what was going on and only scored 3 points.  

But then, I broke out Pandemic, and everything changed.  He drew the Medic role and was like “that’s me!”  He spent a lot of time volunteering to give medical aid to people in Middle and South America so he really related to the theme.  

Then we started and he was engaged IMMEDIATELY.  He was zooming around the map with pro action economy, totally engaged in strategizing with everyone, and we won our first two games.

Afterwards, we sat around the table talking about the the game; and he even texted later with ideas for new strategies!

I’m super proud of getting him into pandemic.  But I’m having trouble finding our next game.

Most of the good ones seem to be very complex, very long, and/or campaigns.  I’d like a game that is a similar length and complexity to Pandemic.  I believe he could learn more complex games, but I want to ease him into it.

His interests are sailing, Jimmy Buffet, and historical documentaries.

"One of the very first areas that fills up is the ""paint your own miniatures"" area.  Each person gets a desk for paints, minis, etc...and all the desks create a giant square.

As a D&amp;D lover, I am all for miniatures and painting them although I personally never had minis and can't even color in the lines.  And like any other hobby, I can understand that miniature lovers like to get together and talk about it, share insights, and whatnot.

But this area seems to be about 50 people, each painting their own mini(s) in solitude.  There doesn't seem to be any Bob Ross of mini painting there giving advice.  It doesn't seem like any two people are working together or even communicating unless they came to paint together.  It's almost like they are factory workers putting in a shift.

Clearly I am missing something.  Are there paints or minis you can only get or keep if you buy and paint them there?  Is there some kind of secret contest where the best painted mini is awarded a trophy?  Or is there just simple joy or peace in painting minis amongst other painters?

Everyone in that area seems to be happy they are there, and others wait in line to do it.  As a mathematical person this seems almost mystical to me, but I am hoping to be enlightened.

This is my design for a laser-cut insert for Brass: Birmingham. As a game that's in my 'forever' collection, Brass definitely deserves a good insert that adds to the gameplay experience. I generally dislike overly ornate inserts, so I've tried for a subtly industrial aesthetic to match the theme.

Like all my inserts, this one is:

* Shake-proof - Can be stored vertically or jiggled around without anything coming loose.
* Lay &amp; Play - All pieces go directly onto the play area for quick setup.
* Lid closes perfectly flush. 
* Designed for sleeved cards (Sleeve Kings)

All key trays go directly onto the play area, ready for the game to start.

The Card holder holds all sets of cards neatly separated. For a **2p game**, you're ready to go the moment you place it down. For a **3-4p game**, you just need to shuffle in the respective cards and deal out starting hands. The remaining draw deck fits back into its slot for use during the game. The **Wild cards** sit in their respective slots at the top.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5phfshyyv17a1.png?width=1391&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=65163a339ecaa75cb813d1ca527aeb7f879831a9

The resource tray holds all your **Coal**, **Iron** and **Beer** in sloped compartments for easier access. The rear of the beer section holds all the **Merchant Tiles**, neatly separated by player-count. There is also a **Market Overlay** to keep the cubes neatly aligned while playing.

I've upgraded the coal and iron that came with the game, for extra thematic goodness. For the beer barrels, I've just used a silver sharpie on the 'bands' around the barrel. I might perhaps stain them at a later date, but I'm quite satisfied with the look for now.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img ms2l7b71x17a1...*

The four player trays are designed to hold every single piece a player needs, other than the large player board itself. The **industry tiles** are placed in labelled slots. The **links** go in an easy-access pair of slots, so you can just pull them out as needed while playing. There's a long slot running along the centre for the **VP &amp; Income markers**. The **player aid** slots into the bottom. And the **character tile** is neatly held up at the front of the tray.

&amp;#x200B;

There are two identical coin trays so that all players have easy access to make change. I myself generally play with a separate pack of Iron Clays, but I still prefer the game box to be complete and stand-alone.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/n7hgapyey17a1.png?width=1124&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fac6d0d1583c77c16b7d5a6e932bdb5de127045f

Everything fits neatly back into the box, and there's also a small tray for extra pieces. Useful if you've upgraded something but don't want to chuck away the originals.

"In the newest version of Clank there are rooms which have an artifact symbol. When you enter one of those rooms you then are able to place an artifact there and then decide whether to take it or leave it there.

The artifacts are stacked at the beginning of the game from lowest to highest point values, with the lowest point value artifact on the top of the stack. Each time an artifact is discovered you pull it off the top of the stack, unless the room has a + or ++ sign in it which means to pull the second or third artifact in the stack.

In previous versions of Clank, all artifacts were placed at the beginning of the game in specific rooms. Once an artifact was taken, that room was not refilled with another artifact.

We cannot figure out in Catacombs if an artifact is placed in a room and the player takes that artifact, can another player enter that same room later in the game and place another artifact since the room was empty when they arrived.

We can't find the answer in the rule book, so we've been playing in a way that once a room has had an artifact in it, it cannot have another one in it for the rest of the game.

"I don't think any game will ever truly be perfect. I can nitpick just about any game, and the more you play a given game, the more its flaws begin to show. 

For example, Gloomhaven was a game that just sucked me in. Within the first couple scenarios I determined it's a 10/10, but now I have well over 100 plays, and there are glaring issues, like ways to cheese the game or the repetition in scenario goals (primarily, kill all enemies). That said, it never dropped my rating.

On the hand, I love Secret Hitler, but it really shines at 8 or 10 players, in my opinion. If it delivered that experience at all player counts, it'd be another 10 for me, but because of that limitation I feel a 9 is more appropriate.

I've seen people discussing games in general, both reviewers and your typical tabletop gamers, that discuss rating dropping due to sometimes minor issues. 

So, I guess my question is, do you believe any game is truly worth a 10, or is 10 the unachievable perfection that we can only get close to?

My copy wasn't *unplayable,* but as you can see, one of the corners got caved in because the shipping box had less protection than the holographic 1st edition Venusaur I used to carry around in my pocket in the first grade. I spent $300 on a board game about small cartoon animals because I was planning on proudly displaying it to the world (and because none of my Pokémon cards made it to adulthood, somehow), so getting a damaged box kind of defeated the purpose of me backing The Most Wholesome Board Game in the World™ in the first place. Thus, when the game arrived, I documented the damage and politely emailed support. Among other messages, I received a piece of written confirmation that my box would be replaced:

(My warmest apologies, unnamed support gnome. This isn't your fault.)

Immediately, my worry evaporated into a wholesome woodland meadow mist. A promise is a promise, and Tabletop Tycoon is running an Above Board Campaign!

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/30uzzfxedz6a1.png?width=1265&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57d33dd69749fd0bdc4c627b64b5fa9ca3a3ae85

Oh wait, never mind. That part only applies to international tax law. 

Note the written warning in my email that I am ""prohibited"" from ""any disclosure, distribution, or copying"" of the contents of their support messages. Bit of a red flag that, but I didn't sign no NDA! The only privileged information in this exchange is mine. What are they gonna do, call the board game cops? That wouldn't be very wholesome of them.

Note also, I received this email back in September! Hey, it's cool. Fulfilling a large-scale worldwide Kickstarter takes time. I'm happy to wait. And wait I did, for weeks... that dragged into months. Based on the comments in the Kickstarter, they were waiting to distribute replacement components until fulfillment was completed globally. Sure. Makes sense. Everything is above board.

But then, this very evening, nearly 3 months later, I received the following message:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/c10tq5zx4z6a1.png?width=508&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=792ad714b1db3033cc71023265580b855ae1b0d3

There's a lot to unpack here. First of all: no warning that the information in this email is in any way privileged or confidential, so we're in the clear. I blocked out my unique code just in case the fine folks at Tabletop Tycoon could use it to identify me and get me sent to board game jail. I don't belong in board game jail! I sleeve all my cards! 

Second of all, the formatting is awful. Irrelevant, but it had to be said.

Third of all, is $20 a *significant* discount on a $300 purchase that has lost most of its resale value due to shipping damage? I don't know what things are like in your corner of the Everdell Woods, but where I live that's barely enough to buy a grocery bag full of vegetables for crudité! And I eat way more than a pigeon!

Fourth, the definition of ""minor dings or dents"" is, like many definitions nowadays, firmly in the hand of the tycoon... the Tabletop Tycoon, that is. Meanwhile, back in the Kickstarter comments, it would seem that some other people bought my *significant* discount offer at a slightly steeper price:

https://preview.redd.it/cw0u07267z6a1.png?width=1307&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=62dfe16727e9cfe76cb15eaf0eee15896d7ca80a

https://preview.redd.it/nn4iw5c87z6a1.png?width=1307&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=68bc29e56499f291bd004ed1996a79d3014250a3

Taken all together, it would seem that some people (including myself) are having a not-so-wholesome time with The Most Wholesome Kickstarter of All Time™.  

Anyway, don't forget to back Lil' Everdell! Your copy might arrive with some minor dings or dents, but I'm sure you'll manage. I might even send one of you fine woodland creatures my *significant* discount code if you can't prove you're not an undercover board game cop. I wouldn't last ten minutes in board game jail! They put all their tokens in Plano boxes!

"So about a year ago now I was friends with a bunch of people who loved weekly boardgame nights so I thought I'd give it a shot. Played my fair share of tabletop games, but boardgames rarely progressed past the standard family stuff for me.

Whenever we'd break out a more rules-heavy game when everyone else knew the rules but I didn't it felt like it was one of the worst things I'd ever played. Everyone else wanted to get started so I always felt like I was being rushed through the rules, never having a chance to actually look at the rulebook. Things would be explained whenever they became relevant which would entirely screw me in the only time I played Catan, being entirely unaware about 90% of the game during startup while everyone else was playing tactically (which showcases the other main issue I had).

One of the worst experiences was easily Betrayal at House on the Hill, where halfway through I was the betrayer and handed an entire new set of rules I was forced to play by. Barely knowing how the game functioned to begin with I needed multiple outside people to tell me even just the basics of what I was doing. After about 10 minutes of my confusion we played for 2 more turns, where I was instakilled because someone had two items that comboed in a way to get past my invincibility. Maybe I'm just being unfair by disliking them playing the game effectively, but apparently there was actually a clear way to play the character correctly I was just too inexperienced to know it.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to be fair to these people, because I don't expect them to baby me through everything and they just wanted to play. I don't think their fun should stop just to make sure I know everything they do.  
But at the same time it just felt awful and caused me to stop joining them, I just wanted to know if this was in any way a typical experience or if these people I used to hang out with were just kinda assholes when you put a few dice in front of them and I should continue trying to find a group I enjoy playing with.",Is it just my old group or does it suck being the only person who doesn't know the rules?,1,self.boardgames,zqamfd,LittleMissPipebomb,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/zqamfd/is_it_just_my_old_group_or_does_it_suck_being_the/,1671500784

"Would like to buy my sister one of these 2 games as a Christmas gift but not sure which to get. She asked for Wingspan...but I think that's just because it's popular.

Thing is, I haven't played either of them so don't actually know how fun either of them actually is.

Obviously, Wingspan is immensely popular, though I'm not entirely sure why. Watching reviews of it, the game seems rather dry and boring, and a bit fiddly. And this is coming from a guy that loves fiddly games like Gaia Project and Nemesis: Lockdown. Quacks sounds like a much lighter and more fun game to play while having drinks with friends and family. But maybe I'm wrong?

"Some months ago I played a game at a friend's house, but I can't remember the name (and I can't ask to him)

The game was a dudes on map game. Every player had a faction and every faction had 3 types of units. You would then build an army on your map. Every turn you could move a group of units based of the movement speed of the slowest unit in the group.  
You could also control cities and forges. Cities were occupied by eleves and would grant you victory points, forges would grant you equipment cards.

The battles were fought via dice rolls, I think you would count the number of skulls on your dices and check for the defence of the enemy units, but this memory is a bit blurred.

"I bought it recently and I LOVE IT, but I'm interested in variations of the game, whatever you have on it I can try. I have one right here:

Disclaimer: So when I got the game I misread a few things in the rulebook (English is not my main language) and well, I ended up mixing everything up, but it came out well nevertheless. So, the 'rules' that I applied were the following:

1st Phase: Everything just as the ruleset says.

2nd Phase (Magic phase): Rerolling Hazard Dice was allowed (Again, English...not my main language), making it a super fun push-your-luck moment. If you didn't have tools it meant you might try to get less negative points, but if you did have tools it mean you could try to get more points even though you might get negative points if you didn't have the correct tool (i.e. maybe you have the pickaxe and shovel but not the shield). All in all I think the original ruleset is better, the tools dice is better to reroll but rerolling the hazard was also cool. 

3rd Phase: After scoring everything just as normal, if you had any chest among your dice, you could choose which dice to KEEP, but not cache...what do I mean by keeping? well...

4th Phase: and this is where I really f'd up. Instead of rerolling everything you had and keeping it, I made everyone return all their dice to the bag and filling the mountain again with all the dice that were left in the bag plus the ones that the players had gathered (oops, I guess). I mean, it kinda worked, of course the Treasurer became OP and monstruous points could be gotten, and chests became OP as well, but in general it was still fun and you could still win.

TL;DR: don't pay attention to my rules, they weren't as cool as the originals.

"TL;DR - **BUYING FROM MINIATURE MARKET IS CURRENTLY HIGH RISK.**

-------------

This used to be my favorite online retailer for just about all things game related. Board games, card games, accessories, etc.

I hoped that [Asmodee buying Miniature Market](https://boardgamegeek.com/blogpost/126073/online-us-retailer-miniature-market-purchased-asmo) wouldn't really affect the site too much. It is, after all, a separate website and its own web service. How naïve past me was. It seems Asmodee's complete inability to provide any level of customer service has been passed on to Miniature Market. 

From my recent experiences, it is literally impossible to get in contact with ANYONE that works there. They'll keep taking your money no problem and not actually send you orders. So fun. Been trying to get in contact with someone for **MONTHS**.

* Emails go entirely unanswered. Complete waste of time.

* Live chat service seems to have been permanently disabled. Probably because they do not have support staff.

* Phone calls result in ""no staff available"" and hang up or ""we're closed"" and hang up. Neat.

Miniature Market kept pointing to a warehouse move that was delaying normal business operations. Understandable that may cause some delay... until something like 7 months later and the issue went from ""slight delays"" to ""complete lack of progress"". 

December 15th they [posted an announcement](https://www.miniaturemarket.com/new-warehouse) that all orders dated December 4th and earlier were successfully shipped out. Good news, right? No! I have orders spanning from **AUGUST** that have yet to be shipped. I'm sure I'm not the only one. This same announcement asks people to reach out to them via phone or email for support or questions... great idea, if they ever answered.

I like to think I'm a patient person. Miniature Market's previously good record of prompt, excellent customer service built a lot of good will with me. I'm now completely out of that good will. They've destroyed it all.

Honestly, I'm at my wit's end here. I've made more than enough attempts to try to contact them. My bank won't do anything because the orders are too old. What is there left to do? It feels super Karen, but is it time to [file a complaint](https://ago.mo.gov/app/consumercomplaint) with their state's Attorney General's office? Not like they'd do anything.

---------------

To round out this post so it's not just complaining, here's a solution of some better places to shop online (for when your local store is not an option):

* **Game Nerdz** - Good prices and lower free shipping threshold ($75). Shipping can take a bit longer but they do actually ship orders. They now offer order Holds, although it's a bit more awkward to use. All my customer service interactions have been great. This is currently the place I shop at the most.

* **Cardhaus** - Consistently low prices and a bonus 5% discount on preorders. Higher shipping threshold ($99), but their orders usually ship very quickly. Smaller selection of items and do not carry newer TCG product. Also, no Hold system, otherwise this would probably be my first choice for board games.

* **CoolStuffInc** - High shipping threshold ($150) and usually takes a bit before orders get shipped. Also sells card/mini singles and offers lower free shipping on those ($30). Item selection is usually decent with often good prices. They do offer a hold program they call Ship It Later.

"My kids LOVE clue and especially love the ""have a piece of paper to x things off"" aspect of it. We use simpsons clue so the kids just think theyre guessing a room, person, and object with no idea that a murder has taken place.

"Back in April CDProjectRed was offering preorders for Witcher Old World on their web store. Seeing that I could no longer back the game on gamefound I decided to order through them. I wanted to check the status of my order and noticed that my account shows I placed no orders.  

I decided to email them to ask if they happen to know when the game will start showing up and the reply I received was weird:

&gt;Regrettably we received information that we would not have received the Old World board game products till January. Due to the fact that a new external partner will be taking over store sales, we will not be able to fulfill your order at this time. 
 
&gt;That's why we will have to cancel your order and issue a refund. As the initial transaction is too old I would need your PayPal account information to send the refund. Could you please send it to me?
 
&gt;At this moment we do not have any information if the Old World board game products will be available for purchase once the new partner takes over.

 
So If you have a preorder for this game through CDProjectRed contact them because you won't be getting it.

"The original Nemesis is the only Awaken Realms board game that has really held its place on BGG in rankings. I know that Nemesis can REALLY divide people. You either LOVE it or HATE it. There is no real in-between on that game! TG sat around the high 20s low 30s, but it's fallen to the 80s now. I don't think any other AR game has really climed up the ranks on BGG like Nemesis or Tainted Grail has. I'd say that ISS Vanguard has a very good chance of claiming the list when more people get ahold of it.

The original Nemesis raised $3,753,300 with just over 35,500 backers back on Feb. 7th, 2018. It's sitting at rank 18 on BGG.

Nemesis Lockdown raised $6,303,539 with 41,907 backers on Jun 18th, 2020. It's sitting at rank 374 on BGG. 

About 850+ days had passed from OG Nemesis to Nemesis Lockdown, and it's been 900+ days since Nemesis Lockdown was fulfilled.

I could be wrong, but I do believe that Nemesis Lockdown is AR's best crowd funded game they've ever had. Granted, it had OG Nemesis and Nemesis Lockdown.Tainted Grail raised just over $6M, and on Gamefound the new TG raised over $4M but they also let you pick up OG TG like they did with Nemesis. ISS Vanguard made just shy of $5M on Gamefound, so if you look at those two games without the ability to purchase older content for the game. OG TG and ISS out performed Nemesis.

I don't think it's an IF, It's a matter of WHEN will AR re-visit the Nemesis IP. I'm not sure AR will be rewarded for another ""re-skinned survive here for so many rounds"" type of game. I don't think another ""base"" or ""ship"" will do it. I wouldn't be surprised if they did some form of a campaign since they really get into the untold stories ""campaigns"" but then again I can't imagine being very thrilled for a Nemesis campaign, I think Nemesis would really lose its identity if it took that root by doing a campaign so I guess they'd have to really blow me away if they went on the same path they've been on and do a new theme of the game. Maybe a Nemesis where you play as the Intruders and you have to kill the survivors would be out of the box (I'm not sure how many people would be down for that) It would allow past Nemesis Intruders to be re-used for that and the Kings would become more useful other than a cosmetic choice.

"[Wildlands](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/244654) was one of the very first board games I ever own (discovered the hobby in Jan 2020) and I have loved it to death ever since. Much to my surprise, I’ve found that many people tend to turn their nose up at it, especially wargaming types. I’ve been playing it fairly often for two years and I still love it. It’s a BLAST. Regardless of how much people seem to dislike it, I think it’s fantastic. 

The problem is, I can’t find anything else like it. At all. Any time I try using any keywords to find something similar (skirmish, arena combat, dudes on a map, etc) I get all these huge, involved war games.

2. Bang (card based role play game)
3. Risk
4. Scotland Yard

"I played this game about 5 years ago, where the main mechanic was having a deck of tiles of different path shapes that you would draw from, and place them down on a fixed board to try to get your piece to the goal on the board. There was a scoring system that was determined by order arrived at the goal and also items picked up along the way.

The theme was that you were explorers looking for lost treasure or artifacts a la Indiana Jones/Tomb Raider/Uncharted.

The person at the boardgame store was sure was I was talking about Labyrinth but while that game looks to share a lot of similarities, mechanically it was different, as in the game I played you take turns drawing and placing tiles on the board rather than placing all the tiles to start the game.",Path-finding game with explorer/treasure hunting theme,1,self.boardgames,zpfks8,BroForceOne,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/zpfks8/pathfinding_game_with_explorertreasure_hunting/,1671417325

"While playing Splendor with 2 players, we found that the games' suggested target of 15 points is way too low, so we upped it to 25. That seemed to open up gameplay, but made the nobles less powerful.

Still, obtaining nobles became a breeze, so we also added the rules that nobles cost 1 more of each card type and that the same card could not be used to obtain more than one noble.

These modifications satisfied for a while, but as our gameplay became more linear as strategy solidified, we found ourselves wanting another dimension to the game. Since Splendor is an engine-building game where your engine only gets more and more powerful, we wanted a way to make the engine stall out, or plateau.

Enter: Resource Management

When purchasing a card from tier 2, the player must discard one card to the bottom of the draw pile for the discarded card's tier. The discarded card must be from the color(s) indicated in the purchased card's cost. When purchasing a card from tier 3, it costs 2 cards. This also allowed us to raise the target score to 40. We're going to try 50 next.

This modification has really added a lot more strategy, slowed down the game, and uses more of the decks, while also keeping gems still relevant in the late game. We really like it, so I figured I'd share.

Anyone else have rule modifications that really improve their games?",Splendor modifications,1,self.boardgames,zped33,newfoundpassion,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/zped33/splendor_modifications/,1671413823

-cards were in the middle of the board 
-sometimes you would pick up cards of a country such as Nigeria and sometimes it would be something else- cannot remember what you did with those cards
-I think you would keep cards in your hand that you would do something with but again I don’t know what

"Do any of you have this archetype in your regular game group?

I have this friend who I've known for decades, who I regularly play board games with, and he's a notorious ragequitter.

Somehow, he manages to win 70% of the games we play. He's pretty good at formulating good strategies and figuring out what is good in games, but he is also blessed by the gods of luck and somehow always manages to pull insane opening hands/combinations in almost ANY game we play (to give you an idea, he's started half of the wingspans games we play with the raven in his opening hand).

When he DOESN'T win however, my god hide your kids and hide your wife. He throws tremendous temper tantrums like I've never seen a grown man do in my life. **Literally will throw cards around**, will cross his arms and frown, keep repeating that he's done and is going to quit and never playing this stupid game ever again. It's gotten to the point where I don't ever want to play games 1v1 with him again because the moment things don't go his way or I get a slightest advantage, he will start whining, claiming he's already lost and make the game MISERABLE for me. I have more fun playing close games and losing because if I start winning he will either quit the game early and sap every ounce of pleasure I could derive from winning, or make the entire rest of the game a miserable experience. 

What's more, I swear to god the rules of the game stop existing for him when he's losing. He will start skirting rules, points will start appearing where they weren't before when I don't look, and very questionable things will occur, because ""he's so behind that it doesn't matter, he already lost"". 

So yeah does anyone have someone like this in their group?

"Hello everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I am trying to figure out the name of a board game I played as a kid. The game was up to four players and was played on a gridded board, like a checkerboard. The top side of all the player pieces was the same color and looked identical, while the bottoms were marked with one of four colors, with one color representing each player. The game starts with the player's pieces face down on their side of the board. The goal is to move your pieces across the board, in turn. Once you get a piece to the other side, you flip it over to reveal the color. If it's your color, then the piece stays face-up in that spot. If it's not your color, the piece is flipped back over and remains in play. The first person to get all their pieces to the other side wins! So what is the name of this board game? Does anyone know?

"A few friends and I wanted to get into tabletop wargaming, after playing dnd for a few years, and Memoir 44 was my friends first choice after reading reviews.

I found the game to be very frustrating, I think mostly because of the randomness of the game. 

Three games in a row my team pulled awful cards, and rolled terribly, and we got wrecked. My friends wife was on my team and we both got irritated enough to quit playing. 

I've looked online to see if anyone has had a similar experience and it seems some people have, and the response they get is that, that's wargaming, it's random, war isn't balanced, supply lines, communication ect. It's part of role playing historical combat.

And I think I'm just not the type of person who enjoys the role playing as much as the gameplay. I can get into character, its fun of course, but it's secondary to me.

If I lose a game I want to be able to know why, what I did wrong, how I got outplayed, what can I do differently next time. Not, well, guess I shouldn't have rolled so badly, that's war I guess!

Have less new whiskeys to review but several new games and was excited to play and talk about them. Merv: The Heart of the Silk Road is a game by Fabio Lopiano (art done by Ian O'Toole"" that takes place in the ancient middle eastern city of Merv. This city is, as the name suggests, at a pivotal location in the silk road, the trade route that connected the western civilization to the diverse and spice laden east. In this game, players will amass power &amp; wealth through a series of action- you can collect spices (sets of each of the spices will give points), build walls to protect from mongolian invasions, donate to the grand mosque, and strategically gain the most influence. The core mechanic is really cool- there is a 4x4 grid of tiles that have different colors on them (different resources = different colors) and different actions on them. Players will go along each side and pick 1 tile to get the resource and perform that action. They can then claim the real estate of that tile if it is unclaimed. From then on, if other players want that tile, they can get the resources &amp; action on it, but the player who owns it gets the resources as well. If someone owns multiple tiles in a row, each time someone picks one of their tiles, both players get all of the resources. Its obviously better to have a lot in each row/column and get passive income. After 2 of the 3 rounds, Mongolians attack from each side- if the real estate on each tile isn't protected, it becomes an available space. Its really a well designed game. There are a lot of details that are difficult to include in a written review, and it isn't the simplest game, but its really a great game. 7.8/10

&amp;#x200B;

Now, this is a bottle I reviewed shortly after getting it, but figured it was worth visiting again. The peerless double oak is a top10 bottle on the year for me, probably a top 5 if I'm being honest- how much could 1 extra oaking do?

&amp;#x200B;

Age- NAS, presumably 4 years

ABV- 54.25%

Nose- Smells a lot like 4Roses to me, a dry spiciness. Some cinnamon, vanilla, not much depth but not bad.

Taste- More vanilla, cinnamon, no oak but a youthful wood, almost like a french oak stave. There is a touch of caramel sweetness at the end

Finish- The caramel sweetness fades into a finish that is hotter than expected. Youthfulness is apparent

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, this stuff is fine. I think I liked it way more months ago, but it is crazy that the 2 extra years in the extra barrel bring this stuff as far as it does. 

&amp;#x200B;

"I mean really.  


I liked the concept and I still do. But no matter with who I play or what group I play it is either every one playing alone thinking they are all enemies or everyone playing together and not ruining elses play because they all think they are in the same clan.  


And I think the cards are kind of boring. I am missing action cards that remove ladders, or a card that can swap the hidden ""goal"" cards so you can change location of the exit of the cave, a card that can add a ladder to your current location...  


I also think that monsters have almost no effect. Atleast for us. Who wants to use monsters on a team mate? Even if I know who my enemy is, I don't want to attack him with monsters or else he knows I am his enemy.   


I am totally missing the point in this game cause no group I played with played this correct yet. And I don't think the action cards are good enough to make it be played correct in the first place. Only 5 action cards to check for hidden goals OR for other players team. Even if I use that to check a players real team I can't really support him other than giving him boots, but then once that happens all know we are a team.

##FAQ

**I live in Barbados/Canada/Colombia/USA, why are you posting on a Saturday?!**

Because I'm writing this from Europe in the future where it's already Sunday. Timezones be crazy.

**Why are there a bunch of non-board games in the board game list?**

Because the Tabletop games category on Kickstarter includes anything remotely related to board games and sometimes things slip through my filters.

**Why is this future award winning board game and literal saviour of humanity missing from your list?**

Sometimes my filters get a bit overzealous and discard actually valid projects. If you feel something is missing for this reason, leave a comment and I'll add it (maybe).

**Can I donate all my money to you?**

No

**Can you help me promote my game?**

Please no. I make lists. Nothing more.

**Your list is full of errors and now the Internet is full of cats!**

Indeed, this fine piece of code runs purely on happy thoughts, so anything can happen. Leave a comment and I'll see what I can do.

"Ran into an interesting scenario playing LL tonight. Two players were left. Player A drew the last card and played a card. So the end of the round was triggered. Now it was time for Player A and Player B to compare cards. Player B had a Spy. The rule book states that if you played or discarded a Spy you get a token. 
Our question: If player B has a Spy in her hand to COMPARE at the very end of the round and it’s a spy does that count as playing/discarding it? Is the final comparison a play? If so, you can’t play the Princes, right?

I think the final comparison doesn’t count as playing or discarding and you wouldn’t get a token if you finish with a Spy in your hand, but wanted to see what other people think.",Love Letter Spy card at end of round comparison clarification,1,self.boardgames,zoqzc9,itsactuallyoctopuses,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/zoqzc9/love_letter_spy_card_at_end_of_round_comparison/,1671341272

"In the light of my previous post about [the most prestigious Race for the Galaxy game possible](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/y1ceg8/most_prestigious_race_for_the_galaxy_game_possible/) and after a game where I racked up quite a few VPs I thought I'd explore how a player might attain the most VPs possible. For clarity, this isn't aiming for the highest score possible (since my Prestige scenario blows it out of the water) but the most VP chips (the  hexagonal cardboard counters in the physical game).

Again assume two-player expert variant with the base game plus Gathering Storm, Rebel vs. Imperium, and Brink of War expansions.

TL;DR: I believe 86 is the maximum with this scenario. 

Our protagonist's tableau looks like this:ol

1. Start world: Earth's Lost Colony (produces 1, consumes 1 for 1 VP, 1 point)

2. New Earth (produces 1, consumes 1 for 1 VP+1 card, 3 points) 

3. Smuggling World (produces 1, reduces settlement cost for blue worlds by 1, 0 points) 

4. Retrofit &amp; Salvage, Inc. (produces 1, reduces cost of developments by 1, 1 point)

5. Galactic Studios (produces 1, consumes 1 for 1 VP+1 card, 3 points)

6. Galactic Salon (gain 1 VP for consumption, 2 points)

7. Gene Designers (produces 1, consumes 3 greens for 1 VP+1 card each, 3 points) 

8. Imperium Blaster Gem Consortium (produces 1, consumes 1 brown for 1 VP+2 cards, 4 points, 1 military) 

9. Rebel Warrior Race (windfalls 1 green, 2 points, 1 military)

10. Hidden Fortress (allows a 14-card tableau before triggering endgame, 3 points)

11. Interstellar Casus Belli (consumes 1 Prestige for 3 VPs, 0 points)

12. Tourist World (consumes 2 for 3 VPs, 2 points)

13. Alien Tourist Attraction (produces 1, consumes 1 for 1 VP+2 cards, 3 points, 1 Prestige) 

Rebel Warrior Race is conquered with New Military Tactics, and Hidden Fortress is conquered with another copy of New Military Tactics. Assume that our protagonist acquired 28 VPs by the end of the penultimate turn (Brink of War adds 5 VPs to the VP pile's normal 12×player count) and the opponent has none. The protagonist has 4 military, 2 Prestige, is the sole Prestige leader, has a hand of 10 cards, and every world has a good on it. 

At the start of the final turn the protagonist earns 1 VP for being the Prestige leader, reaching 29, and gains a card for being the sole leader and gaining a Prestige from Alien Tourist Attraction last turn. The protagonist chooses Develop and Prestige-Consume, while the opponent chooses double Settle. Protagonist develops:

14. Improved Logistics (allows two worlds to be settled in each Settle action, 2 points)

Now our protagonist has 9 cards (thank you Retrofit &amp; Salvage, Inc.). On the first Settle our protagonist settles:

15. Dying Colony (windfalls 1, consumes 1 for 1 VP, 0 points)

And then uses Improved Logistics to settle:

16. Uplift Revolt World (windfalls 1 green, 2 points) 

Now our protagonist has 7 cards. For the second Settle our protagonist settles:

17. Alien Toy Shop (windfalls 1, consumes itself for 2 VP, 1 point) 

And then uses Improved Logistics to settle:

18. Galactic Resort (windfalls 1, consumes 1 for 1 VP+1 card, 2 points)

Our protagonist has enough cards to settle this thanks to Smuggling World and ends this phase with a 0-card hand. 

Going into the Consume phase our protagonist has 29 VPs, and gains triple the following sum: 1 for Earth's Lost Colony consuming its good; 1 for New Earth consuming its good (plus a card); 3 for Tourist World consuming the goods from Smuggling World and Retrofit &amp; Salvage, Inc.; 1 from Galactic Studios consuming its good (plus a card); 1 from Galactic Salon; 3 from Gene Designers consuming its good and the goods from Rebel Warrior Race and Uplift Revolt World (plus three cards); 1 from Imperium Blaster Gem Consortium consuming its good (plus two cards); 3 from Interstellar Casus Belli consuming the last Prestige; 1 from Alien Tourist Attraction consuming its good (plus two cards); 1 from Dying Colony consuming its good; 2 from Alien Toy Shop consuming its good, and 1 from Galactic Resort consuming its good (plus a card). The total is 19×3=57 VPs plus ten cards, for a VP total of 86. Adding in 34 points for cards and 0 for Prestige (started with 2, burned 1 to triple-Consume, burned the other with Interstellar Casus Belli) gives a final point total of 120.

This isn't a unique solution—you could use Retrofit &amp; Salvage, Inc.'s ""recover opponents' discards"" power to inflate your hand size, and swap around some worlds and even developments (Mining League, Galactic Trendsetters, Universal Symbionts, Galactic Genome Project). However, the two driving forces in this scenario are tableau size and the VP:tableau spot ratio. Hidden Fortress and Improved Logistics increase the tableau size, and the top two cards for VP: tableau spot ratio are Interstellar Casus Belli at 3:1 and Alien Toy Shop at 2:1. There's nothing else that beats a 1:1 ratio (a card produces &amp; consumes its own good for 1 VP [the cards used above plus Universal Symbionts], a card produces its own good and consumes it and other cards' goods for 1 VP each [Gene Designers is the only one I've found], or a card that doesn't produce a good consumes for more than 1 VP [Tourist World,  Galactic Trendsetters, Mining League, Galactic Genome Project]). Everything else is below 1:1. So, as long as you include Hidden Fortress, Improved Logistics, Interstellar Casus Belli, and Alien Toy Shop the general strategy above can be adapted to yield many different 86-VP combinations.",Most VPs in Race for the Galaxy,1,self.boardgames,zopj6k,twilightstruggleacct,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/zopj6k/most_vps_in_race_for_the_galaxy/,1671336503

Dice as unit models, simple to track but could be easy to misunderstand in rules and feels 'tacky' or low-production value to some players

Standees with pegs, so a standee with the units health printed on the paper next to the model (3,2,1 progressing downward from the top) with a peg that fixes to the standee and could be moved down

Bases with a wheel with numbers on it that can be rotated, like Star Wars Armada

"I realized recently that most people I game with regularly do not have boardgamegeek accounts. And most that do, they're neglected or have no real data (i.e. created but no ratings).

Of course I'd expect that for my extended family members who don't buy modern games, and only play ones that I introduce. But it applies to most modern board gamers I know!

This surprised me, so some examples:

1. My wife doesn't have a BGG account, and she enjoys plenty of modern games (though usually lighter complexity like Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective and Kingdomino).
2. A couple I often play with owns 100+ games, including heavy games like Terra Mystica and Gaia Project. Husband has BGG account but very out of date (2+ years) and wife never had one.
3. Another friend who got into gaming \~5 years ago only owns \~10 games but likes and frequently plays heavy games like Mage Knight, Spirit Island, etc (lots of solo gaming) but no BGG account.
4. Another couple we recently met are also serious gamers (own 50+ games, lots of coops like Gloomhaven, Pandemic Legacy, T.I.M.E. Stories, etc) but only he has BGG account, and very out of date (neglected for &gt;5 years).
5. Lastly, another two serious gamer friends (Dominion, Battlestar Galactica / Marvel Champions, Firefly, Zombicide) only recently created BGG accounts when I pestered them to do so (for my recommender website).

&amp;#x200B;

So, I was wondering if the people I game with are outliers, or if most people who play modern board games just don't bother with BGG. So a few questions:

1. Do you personally have a BGG account with data (ratings / ownership) that's been updated in the past year? (I'm assuming so, but based on the above, I really want to check my assumptions.)
2. If you play games with your SO, do they have a BGG account? (I'm wondering if most couples would find a 2nd account redundant, since owned games are shared. Ratings can obviously differ though.)
3. Do the people you play modern board games most often with have BGG accounts?",Gamers without BGG accounts,1,self.boardgames,zom6k7,BadgeForSameUsername,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/zom6k7/gamers_without_bgg_accounts/,1671326215

"So I was looking at my board game shelves which are organised in alphabetical order and thought I had a good idea for a fun activity for this sub - what is your favourite game for each letter of the alphabet?

Here is my list for the letters I have at least played a game from (writing on mobile so hopefully the formatting won't be a mess):

A - Ark Nova - I adore the theme of this game and the action selection mechanism is my favourite part of this game, being able to manipulate the cards for long term planning is super satisfying.

B - Brass Birmingham - my all time favourite game. Flipping tiles and making money, what's not to enjoy? 

C - Carnegie - my favourite game of 2022, super solid euro with an interesting action selection mechanism.

D - Decorum - completely different to any other games that I own, a great puzzle and always a source of laughs.

E - Everdell - A cute theme, a calm experience and great replayablility 

F - Food chain magnate - so gruesomely mean. Is there a better feeling than swooping in and stealing another restaurants order?

G - Gaia project - great depth and lots of replayablility. The tech track is a particular highlight for me.

I - Inis - my favourite area control game. I love the tension in this one, especially when it's close to someone potentially winning.

J - Jaipur - the first game I ever bought and one of my most played games.

K - Kanban EV - I love Lacerda games and heavy euros and this is certainly one of the best.

L - Lisboa - amazingly simple despite its apparent complexity. Everything just fits together to form a near perfect game.

M - Maracaibo - the card play combined with the competition for spaces is really enjoyable.

On Mars - my favourite Lacerda, the actions blend with the theme perfectly to create a game with brilliant strategic depth

P - pandemic legacy season 1 - my first legacy game and it was one of the best gaming experiences I've had

S - Spirit Island - my favourite coop. Insane replayablility, deep and thematic.

T - Troyes - I really enjoy the dice manipulation in this one and it probably has my favourite art work from all of my games

W - Wingspan - lovely theme, lots of combinations and possible engines for a lot of replayablility",Favourite board game for each letter of the alphabet?,1,self.boardgames,zokaem,meastham93,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/zokaem/favourite_board_game_for_each_letter_of_the/,1671321611

"A friend was passionately telling me about a game they played last year that sounded great and I was hoping to buy it to play with my family over Christmas - as we greatly need some ""structured"" fun to keep things flowing well. 

The problem is my friend cant remember the name of the game and hasn't been able to track down any helpful information that would allow me to work out what it was - so i thought id see if the games expert of reddit knew what this was. 

My apologies for how few details I have to offer - but I believe in you guys! 

The game sounds pretty is simple; There is a pact of questions which players are ask and if you don't know the answer you have to do you best job at making an answer up and making it as convincing as possible - it is down to other players to determine if the answer is correct/incorrect or if you are making it up. My friend wasn't entirely sure if there were any consequences for being caught bullshitting, or any consequences for claiming a player was making something up when they weren't. 

I know this isn't a lot of details, unfortunately my friend wasn't super helpful, couldn't remember much and wasn't as interested as I was in actually finding it out what it is for me - so I can't really press them for more details.

I also was wondering if anyone else had any good suggestions for fun games to play with my family. I'm probably looking for something card based/or small as I have to fit the game into the very limited luggage allowance i have for my flight. Games like Cards Against Humanity don't have a lot of appeal as they're just a bit too simplistic (Not a great deal of actual game play) and isn't really suitable for a family event. 

Other games i'm looking at are: 

Codenames - which ive played and enjoyed - simple enough to teach to the family, but has some fun social engineering elements. 

Coup - also played this before, is pretty small and simple to learn but I like that a lot of the fun comes from working out if people you know well are fibbing or not. 

I was looking at ""More Or Less"" as well but think its probably a bit too simple - not sure how long we would be engaged for just stating if something is more or less.

My small group has developed an exciting game about train to train combat amidst a world in ruin and we would like to share with you. Part wargame, part boardgame, with asymmetrical factions and various paths to victory, this is an exciting and strategic adventure for 1-6 players. With rules for solo, co-op, oneshots and campaigns, there are a variety of ways to play. We've even developed a rules-lite version that takes a lot of the resource management aspects away for a simple game even kids can play (play tested with my own children to much enjoyment for all).

We've loving crafted a world rich in lore around a solid game. Lost technologies, Fae magics and a world blessed and cursed, all portrayed with stunning aesthetics and game components crafted by our dedicated and talented artists. With model trains, landscape cards, carriage cards, engine control board and more, this game is a visual feast draped over a fantastic experience with plenty of replayability.

"Played this for the first time today loved the game and I have a question about the reward cards and leader cards.

The one player had the reroll all 1s leader card and also had the reroll lowest dice card so essentially he abused this by rerolling all his 1s endlessly until it was not a one, then immediately after that he would reroll the lowest dice number once per attack as the card states in the same attack. So if he attacked with 3 dice and rolled a 6 - 2 - 1 he would re roll the 1 until it was not a 1 and lets say it ended up being a 3, he would then go and re roll the 2 and obviously it always became a high number. It was unbeatable.

I argued that it was overpowered as surely you can't  just keep rerolling all the 1s multiple times and surely you can't use multiple card abilities in one attack, surely there is a limit like you can only use the leader ability for this roll once and if you rolled a 1 again then hard luck that is your special ability used for that roll, no using the re roll lowest number card now. 

&amp;#x200B;

I need some clarification, are you able to reroll multiple times on the same attack as in the case of the reroll all 1s and are you able to use multiple card rewards in the same attack?

Is there a limit to re rolls in an attack?

"Figured I could join in the fun for a top 5 review. 

2022 was the first year I really jumped fully into board games.

I played my first game of Pandemic and it all started from there.

I grew a fairly large collection and played 30 different games out of 78 total gaming sessions

I even tracked all of my gaming sessions to see which was the favorite, most played, and other stats.

For better or for worse for I've become the ""Board Game Guy"" for friends and family and they are always disappointed when I visit and don't bring a board game. 

Throughout this year I've really learned what types of board games I enjoy. I enjoy theme, deck building, and co-op. 

5. Quacks of Quedlinburg

Fantastic game of push your luck mechanics. Easy to teach and learn. I've shown this game to friends and family who don't like board games and don't learn them easily and they all enjoyed this game. A quick and easy game to get to the table for any group. The last time I introduced this game to a friend, they bought their own copy before we finished the first game. This was easily my most played game of the year at 15 total plays. 

4. Wingspan

Excellent engine builder. Beautiful artwork on the cards. Incredibly thematic from the cards, the egg pieces, and the dice rolling bird house. The only critique I can give is that to get the most out of the game you need at least one expansion.

3. Lost Ruins of Arnak

Fantastic deck building/worker placement game. Everyone plays as their own explorer adventuring deep into unknown ruins. This game is great for theme, I love all of the different monsters you can encounter. Additionally it is great because there are so many different ways to win. Also Indiana Jones-esque meeples?! Love it. 

2. Lords of Waterdeep 

My girlfriend and I came across this game a while ago as we started getting interested in D&amp;D. Note: the only D&amp;D aspect about this game is the setting and theme. But it is incredibly addictive and is a fantastic introduction for worker placement games. Play as rival crime lords in the city of Waterdeep you don't adventure yourself but gather teams to do it yourself. Build your reputation through positive or nefarious deeds. 

1. Mansions of Madness

I only recently played this game and was blown away by it. This game oozes with theme and atmosphere.  You play as an assortment of characters from the 1920s investigating paranormal occurrences. Fantastic co-op and dungeon crawler game. The game is run by an app which only helps add to the atmosphere. Reminds me a little of a Lovecraftian D&amp;D campaign. I've already bought some expansions to continue the adventure. The only downside is replayability which is helped out a little by the app which can add some variety if you are repeating missions. 

______

Honorable mentions: games I really enjoyed but not quite enough to make it to the top 5.

1. Mysterium

Mysterium just missed out on my top 5 by a hair despite being my 3rd most played game. It is a fantastic co-op game where psychics try to find a murderer by visions sent to them by a ghost. Easy to play and teach (set up can take some time). This is a great party game. 

2. 7 Wonder Duel

Great two player game and small (it travels well!). Play as rival empires trying to become the strongest empire through a few different means. Each game is fast paced and a little frenetic as you try to outmaneuver your opponent to maximize points or beat them with military or science points. Probably the best two player game I've played. 

3. Res Arcana

Could have been higher but it is a new addition to my collection. Great card game where players assume the role of sorcerers trying to become the strongest in the land. Great strategy game that can be played in under 30 minutes. 

4. Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion

Fantastic game that really taught me about how much more board games can be. Felt like a video game that poured out onto the table. Could be higher but falls victim to recency bias because I played a lot of this at the start of the year but have since stopped.

_____

Dishonorable mention

1. Kabuto Sumo

I was really excited about this game when I first learned about it. And it took a few months to finally track down a copy. A dexterity and strategy game where you play as bugs trying to throw your rival off the board? Sounds unique and really fun. Unfortunately all of my plays were dragged down into a slog that took over an hour each time as players were pushed back and forth nearly losing then recovering. 

2. Harry Potter Hogwarts Battle. 

I have seen a number of positive reviews about this game and really tried to enjoy it. It is a easy to learn deck building game that could be great with families. But for me, it was an incredibly boring and not very challenging game. If you want to play a deck building game, look at Clank, Lost Ruins of Arnak; those are much more engaging. The only thing this game has going for me is theme.

"We’re a group of 4 friends who enjoy playing board games. We have a coupon to spend in our local store for about 60€, but we’re willing to add to it. We are considering wingspan as an option, but we would like some suggestions.
We enjoy more games that are PvE (if that’s a term  for board games), but we also play pvp games, but more “light hearted” (for example, we’re not looking at something like rising sun).
We currently have mansions of madness (which we enjoy) and tales of evils. A game like those two I mentioned would be nice I guess, but I think those lack a bit of the replayability part.

"in Kemet Blood and Sand, a 2 player game would only use 2 power tile colors with some tiles removed (26 tiles)

The devs have also said to not count the Seth player among the number of players when setting up the game (e.g. use X side of the original board based on the number of allies)

in the Seth 1.5 rule book, it says ""Place all the ruby, sapphire, and diamond Power tiles face up next to the board..."" but doesn't mention a player/ally count. It also mentions to include the Ta-Seti/Onyx tiles (which are included with B&amp;S)

So 2 allies would have access to 4 power banks? Is that correct?

"Hello All,   


I thought it would be fun to join this trend. I have only *seriously* got into boardgames this year, been around the hobby for about 2 years. Here are my top 5 games.  


**5. Aeon's End**  


The reason this is not higher is because of setup time. Aeon's End is a game rich with strategy, variety, and asymmetry. Love all those things. By far this is best at 2 players - my only regret is not getting to to the table more on account of the setup time and the intimidation factor it has for some newer players.  


**4. Feed the Kraken**  


I play a lot of deduction/hidden role games - IMO this is the best. Hidden role games in which the objective is, simply, ""don't get caught"" - I think it is a bit played out. Hidden role games where you must *do* something with your position - perhaps even expose yourself in seminal moments - it is more interesting. I've described this game as ""Werewolf, but with a board game in there"". I think it is salient - a really strong game.  


**3. Arctic Scavengers: Recon+HQ**  


A forgotten gem of a game. While it is not without flaws, and expansions are NECESSARY (hence they sold the game with both expansions in the box) - Arctic Scavengers presents a pure deckbuilder with elements of chance, push-your-luck, and - most of all - with interaction in spades.   


Every turn you use your cards in your hand to accomplish resource accrual and deckbuilding, sure - but you also keep some cards in your hand for what is called ""the skirmish phase"". Players simultaneously reveal the cards they ""held back "" - every card has a ""fight"" value. Highest fight value hand in the skirmish phase gets a special card off of a ""contested resources"" stack (which these are always amazing cards whether in VP or in function).  With this ingenious system you are faced with tough decisions every turn and there are elements of bluffing, etc. involved. When you play a 3 player game and two people hold their entire hand on their turn, do you go for broke on getting some new resources and cards, or do you also hold and join the fight (with a ""wasted turn"" if you lose)?    


Further - there are numerous disruption cards you can play in both the skirmish phase AND resource accrual phase of other player's turns. It is such a ""fighty"" deckbuilder. Never played anything like it. Asymmetrical leader cards add even more spice. It's a gem of a game IMO and, due to it's out-of-print status, a game I cherish and protect and bust out at every opportunity when I ask ""have you played Dominion"" and the crowd nods. It is not as ""tight"" a game as Dominion, and it does suffer a bit of a runaway leader problem, at times - but a deckbuilder rich with *theme* and with *interaction*? I wouldn't believe it until I played this game. The ""we are desperate af arctic scavengers"" theme permeates the game so hard.  


**2. Chinatown**  


Approachable, teachable, and exciting - Chinatown has captured what makes board games great, and in an affordable and easy-to-digest package. I'm not sure there is anything I would change about the game. Maybe a phone app to autoscore at the end-of-round LOL. Only change I'd make - otherwise it's a perfect design. There is little to say about it, IMO, other than ""buy this"".  


**1. Baseball Highlights 2045**  


3 of my top 5 are deckbuilding games. BBH2045 is the best 1v1 game I have ever played (and I have a lot - I really like 1v1) *and* it's a deckbuilder. I've always been in awe of people who hate ""take that"" in games - BBH2045 has two players with hands of 6 cards slapping down cards one at a time. Each card poses both an instant ability (oftentimes defensive, and it responds to the previous player's card) as well as an ability that poses a threat to the other player (in the form of ""hits"" - 'if you let this card resolve, this guy hits a double') .   


You slap cards down trying to stop their stuff, and get your stuff through to score runs . With Robot, Cyborg, and Human cards draftable after every game, you start to build a stronger deck and can straight up ""counterpick"" your opponent's plays. They picked up ""Barry Sosa"", who offers no defensive plays, but is a Human card who threatens two home runs? Pick up a Cyborg pitcher whose instant abilty reads ""vs. a Human: Cancel All Hits"". Your deck never goes over size 15 in this game, so you get a very very  tight deck very early. Pinch hit and on-deck rules make the game deceptively deep - the better player will win the vast majority of the time. This game is an absolute gem. The only downside is trying to get people on board to play due to baseball being pretty out-of-fashion.  


Honorable Mentions:  
**Ready, Set, Bet.** I might have put this on here IF I was not always running the game, but instead playing LOL. Running it is fun, but idk. I ordered a thing to project my phone onto so I can start using the app. Maybe next year this game will crack this list.  


**Project: ELITE.** It's such a great design. The only downside is setup time and intimidation factor for new players - the result is I have tabled it two times only - can't say I'm all the way on board yet for this being a top 5er.  


**Spartacus: A Game of Blood and Treachery.** Please please somebody play this game with me LMAO. Impossible to table game. I played it once a long time ago and it was amazing.

"I'm new to this board game group, and we play a different board game every time. Almost every game is new to me 

I know that slow players can be incredibly frustrating sometimes and there is the fear I have that eventually people will get angry at me

I really wish I was able to read up on what is being played in advance. Watch YouTube videos of it and read the written rules before playing the game irl 

The only problem is nobody is sure what they want to play until they're actually there in the moment. I never know what game to prep for

When things are being explained to me I'm really worried about being an inconvenience by *dragging* out the explanation for people who just wanna get onto the game already.  I don't want to be the ""sorry what? I still don't get it. Can you say that again?"" person. I also have social anxiety. Even saying ""actually can someone swap seats with me, because I can't see the example the person is using to teach us properly"" is really hard for me to say

I like the group and I like the games and I'm trying not to let my social anxiety make me stop going. But I wish I was way better at advocating for myself. It is just super hard to speak up when you're a stranger and everyone else are friends. Because I'm just a random I don't think I have the luxury of making a social faux pas. That is why I won't say anything that can be seen as criticism.  I learn better by reading words and seeing illustrated examples with those words. Aka I learn better using Google and YouTube. I can miss words when people explain things irl and unlike with YouTube I cant rewind or watch a different video to get more than one explanation

If I was braver I would say ""do you at least have some ideas of what you *might* be playing next week, so I can read ahead? I don't mind if there is more than one game""

I have made a lot of progress with my social anxiety but not enough to advocate for myself 

I also have a learning impairment. This means most other new players without learning impairments will learn things faster than me and that can give people the wrong impression that I'm not taking things seriously

It's really hard to tell people that I have an LD though because there is this fear that people will either, in an effort to help, go too far to be helpful that they end up talking to me like I'm an idiot or they have the wrong opinion that it means I will always be slow forever and that it's not worth bothering and I should find a new activity


I find it easiest to hang out with people over a shared activity

I do sometimes wonder if I should only join activities I'm good at but my LD affects almost every irl activity you can think of. If I allow my LD to dictate what I dont do with people, I pretty much won't be doing anything with people",I'm bad at board games and it is making me worried.

"I thought it might be fun to list my top five games from this year:

5. **Tenpenny Parks"""" This seems to have flown under the radar after some initial buzz. It has great art and components (some of the thickest cardboard tokens ever and really nice wooden tree figures, treeples?) and I also enjoy the theme. And while there are dozens of polyominoe games I think the rule where you **can't** place the pieces next to each other makes it play very differently than other games. I really enjoyed it.

4. **Massive Darkness 2** This was my first foray into dungeon craw games that are top heavy with miniatures even in the retail version (which is what I have) and I really enjoyed it. I like how it isn't a campaign and you can just set up a quest and play and that's it. Also, I really love how each character is its own mini game. You have a rondel wizard, a push your luck ranger, a bag building rogue and three others all with their own simple to learn rules. It's fun to just roll dice and thrash through the dungeon.

These next three are basically almost interchangeable in how much I like them but this is the order I would put them in today:

3. **Ark Nova** This is technically a 2021 game but most people got it this year. Yes the hype is real.  Really smooth rules once you learn the icons and lots of interesting decisions. Also I think the idea of having to pull two ends together makes the game feel more different than if the scoring were more traditional. I am sure you all already have this one so I think I have said enough :)

2. **Carnegie** This game is so strange, in a good way. It's the only game we have besides a few tile layers that uses no cards during the game. It's not quite worker placement; not quite action selection. It's really its own thing. But despite that once you play a few rounds you ""get it"" and it is really easy to play. It's also interesting how it is basically a prisoners dilemma as to how mean the game is played. It can sometimes be almost semi co-op with low interaction or you can grind out every move with the goal of screwing the other player(s). I really enjoy it and hope they eventually make the expansion stuff available for retail.

1. **Mosaic: A story of Civilization**. I have really wanted a civilization board game that wasn't super rules heavy for a long time (I got Khora Rise of an Empire last year hoping it would fill this niche and while it was good it didn't quite get there) and this was it. It's very abstract and if you are looking for clashing armies you won't find it here but I love how snappy the turns are and how huge the decision space can be. I also love the look and feel of the game. A small gripe is it is kind of petty to not include a score pad in the retail version and a few of cards felt overpowered in a two player game so we skipped those but beyond that I think this was my top 2022 game.

"“Unpopular Opinion” posts seem to show up about once a week here, but here’s one with a slight twist.

BGG has hidden columns for their grids, including the delta between your own rating and the geek rating.

Looking at these deltas, which games do you rate much higher and lower than average? (Yes, I know, it’s a Bayesian Average, so it can be weirdly skewed).

Here is the URL to see your deltas (you have to replace *YOUR-USERNAME-HERE* with your own BGG username).

https://boardgamegeek.com/collection/user/YOUR-USERNAME-HERE?rated=1&amp;ff=1&amp;columns=title%7Cbggrating%7Crating&amp;hiddencolumns=delta

I apparently like [The Expanse](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/220792/expanse-board-game) board game way more than most.
It’s a streamlined [Twilight Struggle](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/12333/twilight-struggle) that supports up to four players and no dice (which is basically what I wanted **TS** to be).
It’s still not perfect. Unlike **TS**, **Expanse** uses a [Dutch Auction / river of cards](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamemechanic/2924/auction-dutch) rather than individual player hands, and I think the events could be a little more exciting. There might be some bias because I really like the source material (-ish. The books are great. The show, which the board game pulls from, is fine).

The game I dislike way more than the geek average is [Tichu](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/215/tichu). I wanted to like it because it’s a team trick-taking game.
I discovered it belongs to a subset called “[climbing games](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamemechanic/2980/ladder-climbing)” and that I don’t care for them. Having a butt-load of cards for a really good play and not being able to do anything because you’re just locked out feels bad. At least with a standard trick-taking game you get to play a card each round. And this game is just a standard deck of cards with four additions.

Usually the unpopular opinions here are hating on mass market popular games (eg **Catan**), or hating on the BGG top 100 (**Gloomhaven**, **Scythe**). I’m going to join that by adding my second-largest delta as an honourable mention, because it’s a top 100 BGG game that I don’t see derided often:

[Star Wars: Rebellion](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/187645/star-wars-rebellion). I got to play this for the first time at a convention this year and I’m so glad I did instead of buying it to try it. It’s just not for me. In typical Fantasy Flight fashion, there are a bazillion decks of cards, dice chucking for pass/fail checks, tokens for days, and I avoided combat just so I wouldn’t have to go through that slog. The probe deck / searching for the base was great, as were the missions and fleet movement mechanisms. Everything else felt like bloat. I’d have preferred simple stacks of military units with a combined strength value (like **Hamilcar**), and maybe a simple one-pass card reveal to resolve a combat (like **Blood Rage** (see flair)). I see people saying that the expansion fixes this game’s combat, but to me it looks like it adds more ship types and more dice. **Rebellion** could have been a really fun 60-90 min experience without all the fiddly bits.

"Hello everyone my top 10 boardgames can be kind of sus since only for this past year i have started playing boardgames consistently, so please bare with me. For next year my list will probably be bigger.

OK so this is my personal top 10 as of now.

**10.** **DC Deck building game**

This is the game that brought me to the hobby of boardgaming. All i remember is the first time I played the game i was in awe, because i didnt know that boardgaming could be something like this. I knew there were boardgames but i didnt to know it could be this engaging, this amazing and i thank this game for opening me up to the hobby that i now know. Its by no means a perfect game, I no longer play the game, its been years since i last played it because i have found much better board games that have replaced it but i will never forget it for getting me into the hobby and for that im forever greatful to DC Deck buidling game. If you like deck buidling games and the theme of DC then i highly recommend you play this deck builder, specially the second heroes united.

**9. Wingspan**

I love Wingspan is such a fantastic engine buidling game and also the art of the game is amazing. Also the game app is super well done and i play it ocasionally online. The many expansions that it has and the many birds just keep bringing me back to play the game.

**8. 7 Wonders**

This has been one of my most played games ever, its a great drafting game and civ game and not overcomplicated. It can look daunting at first look but its a rather easy game to learn. I have all of the expansions of the game except babel and the best espansion which ads a diferent aproach to the game is the leaders expansion, i never play without it.

**7. Scythe**

This was my first stonemeir game and glad to say that i loved it at first. Its an efficiency puzzle solving game on how to get the most out of the faction your using. My only regret for this game is that i have never played Rise of Fenris because my gaming group doesnt want to play it and i know im missing out but have nobody to play it with. Hopefully i will get to play in the future as i love the Scythe universe.

**6. Destinies**

Destinies is a competitive, story-driven, game of adventure and exploration, mixing an app and a board game. I have only played the base game and i really enjoyed the game, i had fun and i lost every scenario like a total noob but i had fun doing so. I will try it again in the future with the other expansions and also base game as i want to see the others characters destinies fulfiled. 

**5. Blood Rage**

For me this is one of the best war games out there. Its such a simple mechanic of drafting cards upgrading your tableu to get better perks and also the combat is so simple yet so unpredictable. Its very easy to teach and it also plays fast, its not a long game by any means, even if i get destroyed i still enjoy the game. Valhalla here i come!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**4. Trekking Through History**

So this game is recently new and my god i really love this game, it is so simple and so engaging and it is also a really fast game. It also has history bits in the cards and you can learn while playing this game and it also brings some trivia questions to get your history right. everything about this game i love and is one everyone should give a try, anyone can play this game even a newborn baby.

**3. Aquatica**

This is currently my favorite engine buidling game, most game dont even go over the hour mark and is a game that you can play right after another. At first you start kind of slow but once you get your motors going the game starts moving lightning fast. I love it and i like the underwater theme and also the expansion makes the game much better. this game needs more coverage i think its a very underrated game and its so easy to learn. I feel that anyone who loves engine building games should give this one a try.

**2. Lost Ruins of Arnak**

This game!!!! oh how much i like it i think its currently my most played game on BGA. and the leaders expansion makes this game a must play. The leaders make you go a diferent approach each game depending on which one you play, I always manage to loose but i loose having fun thats what matters xD.

**1.** **Through the Ages**

This is my all time favorite game. I play this basically everyday, but i play it digitally because its the easiest way to be honest and i participate i an lot of tournaments, my favorite board game civ game that i have played.

"Not linking as not sure what the rule is to link to an Amazon page, and it would probably be considered NSFW. They've got a game of Parks set up. There's a bowl of food (looks like popcorn) in the middle of the table surrounded by the game. There's a random mug in the middle of the table as well, so someone apparently thought putting their drink right next to the main board was the best place for it, with all of their cards on the other side. And they're confined to using half their table as there's a random succulent sitting out in the middle of the table.

"Hi all.  
I know this might not be your typical board game, but it's a family game we used to play here several years ago and we lost the game, and no one remembers the name, so hopefully someone can shed some light.  


The game is playable from 2 to 4 players, each one has like 10 big A4 cards with big scenes in it. The scenes have all sort of objects in it. The cards are the same for the 4 players.  
For each card, a letter is randomly selected and then the players have a certain time to find objects that start with that letter. The time is given by a hourglass.  
I remember some scenes that are like:

* Inside of a spaceship
* The inside of a ""merchandising"" store
* Pre-historic scene, it has dinosaurs and a sort of angel-lady

The game has a yellow box, although I believe there are different versions of the game. I think it's from Hasbro, but could be wrong","Old game (late 90s- early 2000's), possibly by Hasbro, where you need to find and name objects in different scenes",1,self.boardgames,zngr0s,pepe2992,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/zngr0s/old_game_late_90s_early_2000s_possibly_by_hasbro/,1671203153

"Picked this up a few weeks ago and it has been a huge hit with the wife and I!  We’ve played it 5 nights in a row which is extremely unusual for us.

Pros:
Artwork is amazing.  Very evocative of the subject matter.

Components are extremely well done.  The player boards with cut outs for cards and indented slots for all the pieces are extremely cool!

Card upgrading and cardplay is extremely satisfying.

Area control in the composer area works really well for 2 player.  

Game runs smoothly, with low rules overhead while still being a moderately complex euro.

Gameplay is about 1.5 hrs or less.

The game is tight and yet not unforgiving.

The mechanic of the city tiles being double sided, and becoming more attractive if not chosen in a round is a cool mechanic.

Cons:
-While replayability is present with the different composers providing a different mix (you pick only 2 of five per game), the game is pretty samey from play to play.

-The theme is mostly non existent, though the artwork and components help disguise this.

-You will see the same city tiles every game, and the scoring tiles in the game can be imossible to fulfill, and will therefore sit on the board blocking spaces because no one wants to take them.

"I just finished My City with my girlfriend yesterday and we had a great time overall. The legacy aspect of the game it well done and interesting even if all envelopes are not equally as fun. The progression is nice and the rules are well balanced (they change, but not too much and never become too complicated).  


But I feel like the game was win way before the last game. I was behind in the first 8-9 game, than got ahead during the 8-9 games (there is 24 games in total). After game 18, the score difference didn't change a lot all up until the end. I felt like the last game should have had bigger scoring opportunity, but it was almost the same as the earlier games. I don't know if I'm the only one that thought that.   


And did anyone really get 50 points + in a game (that gives an extra score for the end game)? We're competitive without taking 10 minutes per turn to optimize everything, but the best games we had were around 30 points with a lot of game around 20 points.   


Despite everything, I'd recommand the game to everyone. It is fun, fast paced, cheap and a good experience. You can even play again when you are done because the boards are double-sided (the other side is a replayable version of the game).",My City (no spoiler review/thoughts),3,self.boardgames,znehgs,KnightQC,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/znehgs/my_city_no_spoiler_reviewthoughts/,1671196682

"In **Seasons**, there are 4 bonuses you can take for the cost of VP. The last one is:

&gt; By using this bonus, instead of using the ""draw a card"" action from your season die, draw two power cards. put one your hand and discard the remaining one.

This means that for the cost of 5VP, you have a 50% of gaining nothing (if you end up picking the card you would have got anyway).  

I find the bonus strange because I would have assumed during playtesting people would never pick this one.

Is there some reason you would pick this one that I'm not seeing?

"Hi 😊

I'm one of the two designers of the upcoming game, Shake That City ""the game with the magic box"" from AEG.

I wanted to ask the reddit community about how you perceive the shipping on this campaign, as the publisher, AEG, has introduced something different in this regard, that I personally haven't seen before.

Basically the model works like this: Shipping has a fixed and flat price. However, you can have up to six games shipped to you for that same price, ie. the shipping price does not go up, even if you add five additional copies to your order (for at total of six). So if it's $15 shipping on one game, that can be reduced to as little as $2.50 per game if you order the maximum of six copies.

Another thing that can make this a little more attractive, is that you can also add copies of two of their other succesful (and right now sold out) games to the order, which is Ready Set Bet and The Guild of Merchant Explorers - fresh from their second print runs - and mix and match those up to the total of the six games combined, without paying extra on shipping.

I've seen recent polls where people are 50/50 divided on whether or not they like ""actual game cost + actual shipping cost"" over ""higher game cost + reduced shipping cost"", even when the total comes to the exact same amount. it's very much about perception especially when the game is at a relatively low cost ($29) compared to shipping. It would be different if the game was as a +$100 game. 

So this is exactly where I want to hear your valuable input!

Do you find a flat shipping model like this attractive, where you can mix and match games up to a total of six copies without increased shipping? Or is it just as good/bad as other shipping models?

Thank you for pitching in! 😊 ❤️

"Hello!

I'm scheming to start playing some games with my 11 year old nephew. He lives nearby and has showed interest in various board games setup on my table when he visits. However, the majority or possibly entirety of my current collection I don't think is suitable for him. I tend to play medium/heavy games which are likely outside his level - although he is a VERY sharp kid. In a few cases, I don't think the theme/visuals are appropriate for someone his age.

A few mentions on suggestions:

* His father wants minimal screentime, so App-driven games are out
* I don't want to get into any LCG type stuff, even though something like MC could be suitable.

While he is very competitive, I think playing Coop games would be best! What do you think is good for someone around that age? Again, he is super sharp so would catch on fast.

"Hi there,

I am currently developing my first game and hopefully next week I can start with blind tests to see, If everyone understands the rules.

My plan is to do a crowdfounding at some point in the future. So currently I'm also brainstorming how I could do a campaign and I would like to know your opinions on stretchgoals.

What type of stretchgoals do you like, what do you hate? Do you like the basic concept of stretchgoals or do you dislike them?

Personally I like the idea. But some stretchgoals seems a little bit of to me.

Sometimes it looks, that a stretchgoal is a core part of the game and without it the game will be way less fun or the creator even cancels the founding, If a certain stretchgoal is not attained.

Some goals are unpolished, so it looks like the stretchgoal was just added, because stretchgoals are a part of every campaign. Often solo modes or last minute expension fell into this category.

And some stretchgoals just increase the size of the game without adding any additional content. Like more plastic miniatures. This leads to increased shipping costs. 

I don't like these types of stretchgoals.
But I like it, If the goal adds more good designed content to the game.

I'm a little bit in the edge on quality improvement stretchgoals. Usually better quality is good. But sometimes the feel of the components doesn't feel right. The coating or the paper may be more expensive but it doesn't feel good and I think I would enjoy the cheaper variant more. Or new artists are hired and each individuell picture looks better but they graphics are Not consistent anymore.

The current idea of stretchgoals for my game are:

Quality improvement, but only if I could feel and play with a prototype of each quality level.

More game content. I can easily add more event cards. Currently there are 27 event cards. You don't need them but they add a nice twist, If you played a couple of rounds. If I start the campaign with 20 event cards I would have well tested content for some stretchgoals.

I have also six cards that slightly changes the end of the game. These are also only a twist for people who had played a lot. I could add them as some mini expension.

I have also an idea for another mini expension, which would contain only a few additional game components.

A solo mode is does not really fit. Or I haven't had a good idea how to implement it yet. But I could add content for 5 or 6 players.

And last but not least I really like it, how a campaign on thegamecrafter gets a cost reduce if more people backe for a game. As far as I know this is not possible in Kickstarter or gamefound. But I could say, that I give a discount in the shipping costs. But the backers would need to trust me in this and it is hard to verify, that I give the discount. And it will also be hard to make the discount fair. Imagine one person has to pay 30$ shipping and an other has to pay 10$. Would it be fair to give each the same discount, would it be fair to give each the same percentage discount or should I give the discount only to the people who pay more shipping. Because I would be in charge to choose the distributer so I can more or less decide which country has to pay more for shipping.

I hope my thoughts are not to confusing 😄

And I really want to know your opinions about stretchgoals in generell and particular about my ideas.

"**OVERVIEW**

I'm a huge fan of social deduction games. Don Eskridge's The Resistance played a big role in giving the genre momentum in 2009, and spawned many imitations and other games of this type. I was an early adopter, and I remember the buzz and excitement that The Resistance generated, as well as its sister game Resistance Avalon, which is a improved version with an Arthurian theme that came out in 2012. 

[**Quest**](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/316287/quest) was released in 2021, and is a new stand-alone game from Don Eskridge that takes over some mechanics of Avalon, but caters for as few as four players. So it is effectively a twist on Avalon that plays quicker and adds some new twists. It was originally released with the help of Kickstarter crowdfunding in a ""Big Box"" version called Quest: Avalon Big Box Edition which also included a deluxe version of Avalon (Avalon Big Box).

The basic concept of gameplay in Quest will be familiar if you're familiar with Resistance Avalon. Players are assigned hidden roles, some as loyal servants of King Arthur on the side of Good, while others are secretly minions of Mordred on the side of Evil. A leader sends a selection of players on a Quest, which can fail by having just a single minion being part of the selected team. Much of the game is about discussion, deception, and bluffing.  If you're on the side of Good, can you uncover the forces of Evil before they sabotage your quests for Good? And if you're on the side of Evil, can you remain disguised long enough to prevent the Good guys from succeeding with their Quests?

**IMPRESSIONS**

One real advantage of Quest is that it requires less players than Avalon, because it plays well with as few as four players.  Another big change from Avalon is that Quest removes voting to determine who goes on a mission, which makes the gameplay much quicker.  

Quest also adds some new mechanics in the form of magic tokens and amulets.  There is also an important new Final Quest phase called ""Good's Last Chance"", where Good players simultaneously point at two players, and for Good to win they must only be pointing at Evil players.

Prior to this phase there's also opportunity to use the Blind Hunter, an optional character that experienced players consider to be essential. This is an Evil character who may optionally reveal himself at the end of discussion to commence a ""Hunt"". Evil wins if he identifies two Good players correctly, and Evil loses if he doesn't.

The new aspects of gameplay make Quest harder to teach, but the added complexity also results in a greater scope for deduction.  So there is some increased complexity, which does mean that Quest is slightly less accessible to non-gamers than Avalon is.  On the other hand it will especially be enjoyed by experienced players.  Many people who have played both games even prefer Quest over Avalon, but certainly it is different enough from Avalon to be a stand-alone game.

One unfortunate negative is the rulebook, which includes a separate set of Director's Cut rules from the designer together with the publisher's ruleset.  The presence of what amounts to two rulesets in the same instruction booklet has made things confusing.  It was especially frustrating to first-time players who had to wade through everything, trying to figure out the best way to play.  But experienced players almost all agree that the Director's Cut rules are the best way to play, so you'll spare yourself of most of the frustration others have experienced if you start with these rules right away.

On the positive side, the artwork - which corresponds to the new Avalon Big Box game - is magnificent.

**RECOMMENDATION**

So is Quest for you? Don Eskridge has already made a tremendous contribution to the genre of social deduction games, and Quest is another excellent title. It retains enough from Resistance Avalon to feel somewhat familiar, but changes enough to make it feel like a separate game. The biggest changes are quicker gameplay by removing voting, while the new mechanics that are brought in actually give more meat for players to chew on and to think about than in Avalon.

The real appeal of Quest lies in the fact that it plays so well at a low player count, even with as few as four players.  And while it plays more quickly than Avalon, the fact that it brings in some new mechanics produces some added aspects of complexity and deduction that experienced players will especially find rewarding. Avalon still remains the best point of departure for non-gamers and first-timers, but for those looking for something more, and which handles a lower player count, then Quest won't disappoint.",Impressions of Quest - a new and faster Resistance Avalon style social deduction game that's great with 4+ players,1,self.boardgames,zmg6xv,EndersGame_Reviewer,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/zmg6xv/impressions_of_quest_a_new_and_faster_resistance/,1671093248

"I find it strange that there's nothing in the rulebook (unless I missed it when I flipped through it 3 times) that explains the High Council action seeing that its clearly unique comparatively. Can someone help me understand what I'm looking at? The action says once per game but has 4 chairs. I'm assuming that the 4 chairs are supposed to be 1 per player so the ""once per game"" text means when I take the action, I pay the 5 coins cost and get 2 influence for the turn? Or is it 2 influence every turn for the rest of the game since I now have a councilor?

"I’ve been looking into The Initiative as a gift for my niece and nephew.  They just turned 12.  Reviews suggest that the game is quite good, but not challenging enough for adults or for experienced board gamers.  Here’s a little bit about their experience:

  - Quacks of Quedlinberg is super popular.  My niece always wins.
  - Castle Panic is also popular and has been since they were 8 or 9.  My nephew is wild about the theme.
  - We’re starting to play Pandemic and they do pretty well.  Not at an adult level but quite respectable.
  - With lighter fare like Love Letter and Six Nimmt they also do well.
  - We’ve played Saboteur a few times and they are not yet ready for the deception.
  - We’ve played Agricola once but only my niece liked it.  Everyone else (including me) found it punishing.
  - They enjoy Carcassonne: Hunters and Gatherers but are not yet ready to compete with an adult.

They live far away and there are plenty of titles we can play together when I visit.  I’m looking for something they can play primarily on their own.

"I used TheGameCrafter to make my own board game. Later, I bought my own print and play game in a second account using a coupon to see if it worked. I paid 0$ for the game thanks to the coupon but the system registered it as a sale anyway. So now I got a sale on my game at absolutely no cost. I realized that I could theoretically buy infinite copies of my own game and the system would register it as infinite sales. I was like: ""This is amazing, I can technically have the best-selling board game on the entire website at age 15 (yes, I'm 15)"". There was also a game design challenge about to start on the site so I waited until it started to use the loophole I found. I thought that would be the best time because I would get the most exposure before my little trick was inevitably undone by the owners of the site. This is where it gets bad. My game gets locked so no one can by it. ""That's fair"", I thought, ""They'll unlock it once the glitch is fixed"". Then my entire account got locked. Still fair, they obviously don't want me using the glitch on more games so they'll unlock it once the glitch is fixed, right? I e-mailed them to explain exactly what I did so they can assess the problem and solve it quick so I can get back to the game design contest. But then they told me they PERMANANTLY locked my game and this is the hard way to learn not to ""cheat"". I e-mailed them explaining why a permanent ban is too harsh and asking if I could just get my contest entry disqualified if they really think I ""cheated"". No reply. This is where you come in, reddit. I will now list all the reasons that I should get my account back and let you decide if I should, because I really want it back.

# Reasons what I did isn't that bad

1)  I gave myself 2 billion sales instead of just 10, 100 or even 1000 because I wanted to be caught. If I were to give myself 10 sales, I would have gotten the ""redstone seller medal"" which give my game undeserved credibility. 10 sales is what someone dishonest would have given themselves. That dishonest person would likely have never gotten caught because 10 sales isn't suspicious. I don't like being dishonest, it feels like cheating. I just wanted to technically be the best gamecrafter ever, for bragging rights. I knew I would get caught after a few days, because of course the creator of the gamecrafter would hear about a game getting 2 billion sales and get suspicious. I had no reason to choose getting 2 billion over 1000, because other people can't see how many sales I have, they can only see my medals and the best medal on the website is for 1000 sales. **The only reason I could have possibly chose 2 billion sales is because I wanted bragging rights and I wanted to get caught, because dishonesty is bad.**

2) **I didn't hurt anyone and had no intention of doing so**. The worst that could have possibly happened is that someone sees all my medals and decides to get my game based on false information. But they wouldn't even be losing any money because it was a print and play game with free files. He might have  decided to spend 5$ to get all the files before even trying the game, but that is highly unlikely considering how little time I had the medals for (the site removed my medals and sales the very next day, as I knew they would considering how obvious I made the fact that I used a loophole).

3) **I didn't do anything illegal, no one lost money because of me, I didn't even violate the terms of service or break any rules regarding the game design contest**. So no, I did not ""cheat"", I used a coupon. I'm allowed to use a coupon.

4) **I actually helped TheGameCrafter by exposing and explaining in high detail how the loophole I found works so that they can fix it**. Who knows how many people used this technique but only gave themselves a few sales and never got caught. Thanks to me, no one can do it anymore.

5) **I could have used the loophole on one of my games that costs 40$, but I didn't**. I would just have to do it before adding any components to it (when it's free). If I had done so without getting caught, someone might have spent 40$ on a game based on false information and possibly regretted it. But I didn't do that because it's bad, and I'm a good person.

6) **My goals were all completely innocent**:

\- Get bragging rights

\- Make some people that works at TheGameCrafter confused on how I got so many medals, show it to their friends and get me some exposure.

\-Possibly make a youtube video eventually in the style of ""The spiffing brit"" called ""the board game industry is completely balanced with no exploits"". That would be cool.

# Why I should get my account back

1) **I learned my lesson**. The e-mail I was sent said that getting my account deleted was the hard way of learning my lesson. So, I'm assuming the reason I was banned FOREVER was to learn my lesson, so that I never try using any loopholes ever again. Well, I now realize that using loopholes can get my account locked so of course I won't do it again. But that lesson could have been accomplished with a cease and desist letter, just saying.

2) **If I get my account back, I won't use any more loopholes**. I now know that I can get banned, so using another loophole would just be dumb on my part. I no longer present any danger to the site.

3) **I will pay 600$**. My school has a entrepeneuring project thing that gives kids money to start a business. I'm going to get like 600$ to buy 10 copies of my game to sell in person. So, if TheGameCrafter unbans me, they will get 600$. I'm in the middle of the process of getting the money, so if I can't have it anymore, that will have wasted a lot of time for the nice  people that wanted to give it and I really don't want to give them the bad news.

4) The library I went to all the time since I was 9 wants to bay a copy of my game. If the game no longer exists, they will be confused when searching for it.

5) I spent the last 4 months obsessively designing my game. I even spent hours researching copyright law so that I don't accidentaly break it. If I lose all that work over 1 little mistake, I'll be really sad.

6) Supa Game (my game) is literally the greatest achievement of my life. I want it back desperately.

7) If I don't get my account back, I'll probably lose my motivation to make board games and there will be 1 less game designer in this world. The entire mission of TheGameCrafter is to help people become game designers, so banning me seems counter-productive.

8) My game is simular to the video game pokémon duel and there's a whole community of people that want a replacement for it after the servers were shut down. Bring my account back for them.

There is literally no reason to not give my account back. Giving it back has 0 negative consequences and a lot of positive ones. So, GameCrafter, if you're reading this, can I just have it back please?

# Other punishments I could get

As you can see, deleting my account is quite possibly one of the cruelest things that anyone could do to me, and I believe in having punishments that match the crime. Here are some less extreme ideas that'll still teach me my lesson:

\-Disqualifying me from the game design contest. I really think I had a shot at at least getting in the finals and the challenge is great advertizing, so this punishment would be quite devastating.

\-Removing all my crafter points (TheGameCrafter currency). I have 10000, so that would be quite annoying.

\-A stern talking to?

\-(I really don't like this option so please use it as a last resort) Let me buy the 10 copies of my game (and give TheGameCrafter money) , but keep it unpublished forever.

# Conclusion

There are many reasons to give my account back, no reasons not to and the punishment must fit the crime. Internet, please upvote if you want me to get my account back and downvote if not. You can be heroes right now. Also, comment any counter-arguments you may have and which punishment you think I should get. I also think TheGameCrafter blocked my e-mail, so if you could send them this for me, it would be appreciated.

" 

**Description of Request:**

Searching for a simple quick group social game or board game that doesn't fit into the usual mold! (clearer explanations as to what I mean below).

Ideally it would not have too many pieces. If it is to be played around a table, instead of standing up / sitting in a sofa in a living room, then 6 players is ok. As long as the players don't risk getting swamped with tons of small pieces and cards!

Target audience: a group of VERY CASUAL gamers, that have all already just finished eating a HUGE meal, and also drunk several glasses of wine.

**Number of Players:**

Groups. Minimum 4, up to ""the sky's the limit"", but supporting well 6-9 players would be ideal.

If the game allows for ""extras"", additional players that are mostly spectators but that can also indirectly participate, say with a ""crowd voting step"" at end of each round, then it could be fun too. 

**Game Length:**

15-30 minutes. Setting up the game and \*also\* explaining the rules should fit in max 5 minutes.

The game shouldn't have too many ""incremental"" rules, like first you ""should"" play with only the basic ""first game"" rules, then when you play again and add such and such more advanced rules, and then finally you are"" good enough"" to use the expert rules. Assume probably only 1 game at a time will be played in any particular evening, but each time it is with a slightly different group of casual players. So, you play with all the rules right away, no ""learning curve"" needed. The shorter the rules booklet, the better. Just enough choices given to players each turn to keep things interesting, but without risking swamping them with information overload.

Also, avoiding a need for explaining or referring back again to more rules ""right in the middle of the game"". Thus games with lots of special cards that each require a different new mechanic to be explained when that card appears, are out. Games with TONS of special icons + a help sheet to understand what each of them means, are also out (like in Race for the Galaxy).

**Complexity of Game:**

Light, simple, games, let's say maximum complexity of 2.

**Genre:**

Any genre, but family friendly. Ideally, not of the ""cartooney for little kids"" style. Adults and teenagers will play, but younger kids will also be present, so no taboo or ""adult"" stuff.

Nice artwork is a definite plus, but it should be easy to see even in a dimly lit room. Absolutely no tiny text on whatever cards are in the game: players sitting 10 feet away in a living room have to be able to easily ID whatever cards another player on the other side of the room might be showing. Heck ideally no text at all on the player-seen material. If it has text on the cards or other material, then a french version is absolutely required.

If it makes people laugh often, that's a plus.

**Conflict, Competitive or Cooperative:**

Semi-cooperative. Players would be split into teams, and the teams would both cooperate for a big game goal (ideally the goal itself can vary from game to game), and the teams also compete to determine the ""best"" team, maybe with each team also having a secret ""bonus goal"" of their own.

IMPORTANT: A game without traitor(s), without bluffing, without gambling, and not requiring ""social deduction"" mechanics. Simply put: Pure fun, without complications. From ages 9 to 99!

Also, not a ""guessing"" or a ""drawing"" game (Pictionary, Scribbl).

Nor ""cultural knowledge"" games (Scrabble, Trivial Pursuit) or ""physical"" games (Twister, or dexterity/coordination games).

Some randomness ok, but not too much: Winning must mainly come from good team choices / combos. Randomness to add spice but not so much that who wins becomes basically mostly determined by complete luck. Ideally with a mechanic that prevents the classical ""one player in the team takes the lead and decides everything by himself"" syndrome, every player must have their own share of the fun.

Not too much ""strategic thoughts"" involved, and limited player choices (to avoid ""analysis paralysis"").

No hourglass or other ""timer"" mechanic. Instead, ending the turn becomes a quick vote.

Ideally no ""referee"" player that does't really ""get to play"".

Replayability is a must. If every game feels identical, then that's a waste. Maybe a random selection of one from a few ""game main goal cards"" at the start of the game.

**Games I Own and Like:**

I have lots of games, but... zero ""party"" games! I always played with close friends who like a bit more complex board games: Caylus, 7 Wonders, Small World, Le Havre, Power Grid.

The closest I have to a fun simple casual game is Qwirkle, but that's max 4 players, and it typically needs at least over an hour to play.

I have, and I like, Pandemic, but it's too long and too complicated for playing with a group of much more casual players say for playing a few games right after a big Christmas meal. Which is why I need a new game.

**Games I Dislike and Don't Play:**

I played Werewolf several times. I hated it: I prefer open games, not secret ""faction"" games. I also hate Poker. Same reasons.

Then the ""big box"" games like Rune Wars, World of Warcraft Descent, Illuminati Imperium: I had my big box games phase, but nowadays I prefer playing several smaller games from 18h00 to 22h00 PM, rather than a single game starting 16h00 and finishing way past midnight.

I hate games with lots of text or culture knowledge involved like Scrabble, Trivial Pursuit, etc.

Oldies Classics like Monopoly, PayDay, or Game of Life also avoided: Way too much randomness involved, with next to zero strategical choices to make.

"Years ago, a friend's dad introduced the neighborhood kids to an old strategy game that was a lot like risk, but stylized after the japanese samurai era. I remember vividly that you could invest in fortifying one or more of your territories by building sections of a japanese castle every time it was your turn until it was complete. 

If anyone on this subreddit is familiar with this game and what it's called, please leave a comment. I've searched for the game these last few days and have had no luck. My friend's family has long since moved away and I've lost touch with them, so I can't ask them.

I want to get my partner's sister a custom tile rack for the game Rococo for Christmas (bribing the future in-laws? Me? Never!) because she's in fashion and adores the game, the whole family are board gamers and she mentioned that the plastic racks that come with the deluxe edition were a bit disappointing...

Could any kind soul please post up the measurements of both the rack and the tile... and maybe any follow up questions... not a woodworker so I'm not really sure what's needed.

"I just bought a big bundle of Thunderstone Quest content yesterday including quests 1-9 that has been sleeved with mostly the kickstarter sleeves. From what i can tell, these appear to be the newer sleeves, not the out of print OG. Unfortunately, there are still a handful of unsleeved cards in the set. When i asked the original owner about the sleeves they mentioned a small amount were also sleeved in Paladin Percival and they couldn't tell a difference between them and the kickstarter ones. I'm not sure which have had this done, so I can't easily compare.  


Are the paladin sleeves close enough to add on without noticing?   


I also have a second set of Thunderstone quest with quests 1-6 that I was going to sell now that I have the bigger set, sleeved in Sleeve kings, so my other option is to unsleeve 7/8/9/Epic/Promos from the next set and put them in Sleeve Kings, but that seems like a really big chore.",Thunderstone Quest Sleeves Exact or Close repalcement,1,self.boardgames,zlxzsa,BullBuchanan,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/zlxzsa/thunderstone_quest_sleeves_exact_or_close/,1671041468
"Came across three 3D Printed board game shelving solutions today for Kallax shelves

The first one is setup to cut the horizontal boards in half and use them as shelving, this can be done with even basic ply wood. This one looks interesting and keeps a bigger surface area to store games, especially heavier ones, but IMO depending on the height you need the horizontal boards to keep the Kallax unit Stable, also height adjustment is pretty large which could result in wasted space. 

[https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4923102/comments](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4923102/comments)

&amp;#x200B;

There is another full shelf option but they would need to be purchased/cut separately but they are thinner which saves a bit on space. Comes in multiple sizes but are a little thick and hard to change sizes after the fact.

The other one i came is a lot simpler and uses wooden dowels to hold the games. It also has much smaller high adjustments so you can fine tune the height of the shelf.

"Hi. I'm looking for new game for me and my family (wife, and 10-years old son). We start playing boardgames 8 years ago. First, I will introduce some boardgames we play and that we like.

Wingspan - My wife love this game.We have played it many times and no one gets bored. We are all very good at it and anyone can win.

Dominion - Lots of games.  Everyone likes this game, although I like it the most.  We're getting a bit bored with it.  We bought 4 expansion packs, but we play the game a lot less these days.

Everdell - The game is annoying.  It's hard for us to create something good.  There is always a shortage of some raw materials or a worker.  We feel too limited by the game.

Ticket to Ride - Our first board game.  To this day, we come back to it sometimes and it never gets boring.  We don't play it much, but it's still fun.

7 Wonders - We love it because it's fast.  Lots of opportunities and strategies to win which we like.

Splendor - We like this and play sometimes. It's little too short.

These are the games we played the most.  Here are some games I would like to buy.  I am going to buy 2 of them. Of course, if you have any suggestions, let me know.

Azul - Nice abstract game.  However, I don't know if it won't be too abstract, too short and a bit too easy.

Clank! - Deck Building like in Dominion.  It encourages us to buy.  I just don't know if it won't get bored like Dominion.

It's Wonderful World - I think it's a combination of Splendor and 7 Wonders.  Of course, there are other mechanics, but reading about this game I have such associations.

Terraformating Mars - I want to have it.  Really wants.  My only fear is that my wife and son won't be willing to play it.  I've played Ark Nova with a friend a few times, so it's not a problem for me.  However, it may be too hard for the wife and son.

"I’m looking to get a new game, which I will play approximately 50% solo, 25% 2 player co-op, and 25% 3+ player co-op.

Games that I own and have played solo are Viticulture and Scythe. I found them ok as solo experiences but nothing mind blowing. Love both games in general multiplayer. 

I enjoy Viticulture, so on the one hand World might be a good expansion. But on the other hand, if it’s too similar I would probably prefer to get something new (and I like the themes of Spirit Island or Robinson Crusoe)

I’ve played Robinson Crusoe before, 3-player, and really enjoyed it. We came extremely close to winning. However, in general I prefer games with minimal luck (ie dice really annoy me, random card draw is not as bad)

Spirit Island seems to be the community favourite of solo board gaming, but it is £60 (World is £25 and RC is £40). Also I am new to solo gaming so it might be a little much. However, I have been board gaming for several years and do really enjoy highly tactical games with some complexity.

Anyway, I’d like to hear which of these 3 you would all recommend, and why. Thanks

After four years of collecting games, I've managed to restrict myself to a svelte 28 game collection, not counting expansions separately. I aggressively prune games that I don't see sticking around, and have sold 22 games so far. I've managed to play every single one of these games at least once, so my current Shelf of Shame count is 0. Yay!

There are another 9 games scheduled to arrive in the next couple of months, so I'm posting the COMC while my collection is still relatively in control.

Rather than ranking or rating games, I've decided to categorize them by the chances of them being sold. Separately, I'm a huge fan of inserts for games, and I've got a mix of publisher-designed, 3D printed, and custom-designed inserts for the games I feel are worth the effort.

**75% chance of selling in the next year**

* **Anachrony** \- Too heavy for my taste.
* **Kanban EV** **(KS Edition)** \- Too heavy for my group. I've got a beautiful 3-d printed insert for this game, but will likely replace it with Bot Factory.
* **Pax Pamir: 2nd Edition -** Really hard to table, requiring 3+ players to put in the effort to learn the rules, and a longer playtime. 

**50% chance of selling in the next year**

* **For Sale** \- Great with non-gamers, but I personally hate auction games. Would love to replace this with something else that fits its slot.
* **Galaxy Trucker** \- Always liked the game when playing, but haven't *loved* it. I did build a nice custom wooden insert, which should hopefully make its next owner very happy.
* **Gizmos** \- Have played this so often with newbies that I'd like to swap it out for something else that scratches a similar itch.
* **Last Will** \- The theme is so brilliant, and the complexity is perfect as a next step up from gateways. It's just that I personally find the game ok but not great. Again, would love to swap it for something that appeals to me more.
* **MicroMacro: Crime City** \- Played through it, and had a great time. I'm keeping it till I can play through the 3 successors, then will gently bid all four adieu.
* **Moon Base** \- 11/10 Aesthetics, 6/10 gameplay. I've built [a beautiful insert](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/nqkjdz/moon_base_is_a_stunning_game_so_i_made_a_worthy/) for this game, but it's not going to stick around forever.

**5% chance of selling in the next year**

* **Carnegie (KS Edition)** \- Brilliant game, have really enjoyed the 3 times I played it. Hasn't graduated to a permanent keeper, though it has a good chance to. Helps that the publisher included a fantastic GameTrayz insert in the KS copies.
* **Decrypto** **(plus Laser Drive)** \- Brilliant game, among the most played in my collection. Still I'm open to replacing it with another equivalent, particularly if it's easier to teach. Has a beautiful 3D printed insert that I purchased the plans for, holding the base game and expansion in the base game box.
* **Deep Sea Adventure** \- Unbeatable in my collection for the amount of game per box, and a fascinating exercise in punishing hubris. Has one of [my first insert designs](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/kt0pbw/i_designed_and_made_a_lasercut_insert_for_deep/), because you want a really quick setup when sitting with non-gamers.
* **Long Shot: The Dice Game** \- Not much to be said. Excellent game. Though it doesn't have space in the box to add an organizer.
* **PARKS** \- 11/10 Aesthetics, 9/10 gameplay. Still, I can see myself getting saturated with it someday.
* **Scythe** **(plus nearly all gameplay content)** \- Really fun game, particularly while exploring the strategic space. Top-notch aesthetics. Hasn't seen play since we finished the Fenris campaign, since the breadth of the gameplay expansions is quite intimidating. I'm working on an insert to hopefully change that. So far, I've only designed [a holder for the coins](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/totte7/i_built_a_lasercut_box_for_scythe_metal_coins/).
* **Wavelength** \- Excellent game, but could perhaps be knocked out by something better.

**0% chance of selling in the next year**

* **Brass: Birmingham** \- A sublime game design. I have designed a beautiful insert for my copy, which I'll likely post soon.
* **Clans of Caledonia** \- All the fun of Gaia Project in 2/3 the time and mental effort. What's not to love? I haven't made an insert for it yet, and can't decide whether to wait 2 years for the expansion.
* **Concordia Venus** **(plus Salsa)** \- The archetype of elegant board game design. The only way this game leaves my collection is if they put out a replacement with updated graphic design. I've got a very functional 3d printed insert for it.
* **The Crew: Mission Deep Sea** \- Always a hit with non-boardgamers who are familiar with trick-taking, but have never before encountered cooperative games. Does this game need an insert? Who cares? Does this game have an insert? [Of course!](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/ske2vh/organising_and_deluxifying_the_crew_mission_deep/)
* **Dogs of War** \- A.K.A. 'Fancy Hats' the board game. One of my earliest purchases off the strength of the SUSD review, and I'm so glad I got a copy before they went out of print. In some ways, the most aggressive game I own, but has never led to any bad feelings. Has always been a huge hit, no matter what kind of group I've played with. I just regret missing out on the KS factions, and have no interest in paying $40 for each single faction. Will likely make an insert for this someday.
* **Don't Get Got!: Shut Up &amp; Sit Down Special Edition** \- Absolutely brilliant on a weekend trip with friends. 
* **The Fuzzies** \- Jenga for boardgamers, and boardgames for Jenga players. Has led to so many laughs with every group I've brought it out for.
* **Glen More II: Chronicles** \- Has boatloads of variability stuffed into the game box, with a surprisingly simple ruleset. Take a tile, place a tile. Do consequent activations. Of all my inserts so far, [my insert for Glen More II](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/p8rjyz/the_worlds_best_insert_for_glen_more_2/) is my favorite.
* **KLASK** \- Of all my collection, this has the most number of games played. Could have something to do with the fact that games last 5-10 minutes, and leave player raring for a rematch. Huge hit with every person I've put it in front of.
* **Lowlands** \- The best games are about the kinds of player interaction they engender, and I've never seen anything quite like Lowlands. Do you take time away from your own farm to work on the communal dike? If the dike holds, no one will care about your efforts, but if it fails, you'll be well appreciated. Never before have I seen players at #1 and #2 having to work together, otherwise player #3 will overtake both of them. Of course, I've built [an insert for a game I love so much](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/kvqr53/an_insert_for_lowlands/).
* **Sidereal Confluence** \- Might get tabled barely once a year, but such a brilliant event when it does. To win this competitive game, you need to be the best at cooperating with other players. No full insert yet, though I did design some resource trays.

"Guys, I want to start a conversation here. I once ""bought"" my friend a gift (RPG app Dungeon Alchemist on Gamefound in the late pledge) that he had to wait 2 years for. So I felt that I never gave him a birthday gift. I knew he wanted that so badly, but right now I'm wondering if this kind of gift that I cannot put into a gift box under the Christmas tree is a good option.

What do you think? Is crowdfunding a good way of making someone's dreams come true, or maybe you have any solutions on how to put a crowdfunding pledge for someone else into the box and make it a real ""gift""? Printing confirmation email and adding confetti to the envelope maybe? :D

Let's talk about it. I need to know how you deal with ""giving"" someone crowdfunding gifts! :)

So after my impersonation of Tom Vasel, Rahdo and Watch it Played on my YouTube channel, I'm happy to present my next impersonation attempt of none other than Quinns from Shut up and sit down 🙂

I have to admit that while this was one of my more challenging videos to make, it certainly was also one of the more fun ones too.

"Hey r/boardgames,

I want to learn how I could improve my understanding of the learning process of new board games and how to communicate this process to the people I am playing with. 

Background: I often play with my significant other and there is a ratio of 60/40 (65/35-ish) of me winning games. Although my SO is per se not bad at strategy (e.g., I lost the last 3 out of 4 matches in *The Castles of Burgundy*), the frustration levels are getting higher, especially when we are playing new games. I am overall not better at strategic thinking, but I think I am good at adapting my strategy and play patterns as the game goes on and the board state changes. Since we bought *Everdell* recently, I thought it would be a good idea to learn the game together, and help each other understand the actions we make. This could be a fun exercise and also help me with people not playing complex games as often as me. 

P.S.: let me know if this is the wrong flair!","How to improve teaching, communicating, and learning board games?",1,self.boardgames,zlncx1,Fjedsen,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/zlncx1/how_to_improve_teaching_communicating_and/,1671012956

"My quick review after a complete winning game solo!

I know the game isn’t highly regarded as good game, it’s like a 6,5 on BGG I think? 

While it has its flaws (mainly rules confusion since scenarios all have their unique twist), I don’t think it’s a bad game honestly! The solo game has you being « helped » by 2 other characters with 2 power each (and those have 2 choices..) and let me tell you they’re strong! And quite easy to replenish as well. Cards are beautiful and the game flows very well once you get how everything works. The character cutouts may feel cheap but they get the job done.

Now… I am not a solo gamer at all, but I must say I think I’ll enjoy this game a bunch! To me for now it’s a 7-7,5/10.

"This might be a weird thread to make, I've always thought the idea of a ""gateway"" game to be kind of strange. I've been playing board games for 10+ years now, and I've probably tried to intro 100+ people into the hobby. And in my experience, the concept of a ""gateway"" game has never really existed. 

I love heavy Euro games, and given the choice, I'll always play them. And so I often introduce people who have never played board games before to heavy Euros. Some of the people in my group, who have never touched a board game in their adult lives, were introduced on ""heavy"" games like Terra Mystica, Brass, Through the Ages, etc. In my experience, people who like heavy games, just like them the first time. They might be a bit overwhelmed and play somewhat poorly, but the crunch is enough to keep them around. Many of my friends who play Eurogames with me have always liked them.


Other people have hated playing a game like Terra Mystica, but when I show them easier games or more thematic games, they love them. But these people never ""come around"" to liking heavy games. I've never had people ""work their way up"" to liking heavy games. In my experience, people who dislike heavy games the first time, just don't like heavy games.

Similarly I've introduced people who light games who have hated them, but have loved heavier games. I remember introducing an ex-girlfriend to games like Pandemic and Wingspan, and she hated them. She thought they were so pointless and random, but when she played Food Chain Magnate for the first time, she immediately loved it. She *loved* Agricola, she loved Puerto Rico, and she loved Through the Ages. There was no ""graduation"" required. She just... liked heavy strategy games.

The point I'm making here is that in my experience, people like the games they like, and their preferences don't *really* change over time. For me as someone who likes very heavy games, I've never had success finding people and slowly ramping them up to my preferences. Usually based on my observations, for people who like a genre, they'll just like it the first time. I've introduced people on Spirit Island, who have struggled every single step, and as soon as the game ended wanted to play it again.

So is there such thing as a gateway game? For me, a gateway game is just a game they'll enjoy. That could be anything, heavy or light.","Do people actually use ""gateway games"" to get people into the hobby?",1,self.boardgames,zlhw43,HeyItsPreston,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/zlhw43/do_people_actually_use_gateway_games_to_get/,1670993580

"This Friday I’ll be hosting 4 of my oldest friends for a 5 player board game night. I’ve managed a few 3 and 4 player nights before but this is the first time I’ve got 5 of us together. They are my school friends (we’re 40 years old now, family, kids etc) and although they’ve always been into video games they have never been table-top gamers.

It’s been a slow and sometimes frustrating process to get to this stage; having to overcome general disinterest, last minute cancellations, nights descending into drinking and watching tv… The hard work and patience has really begun to pay off over the last few months however. Once one or two of them began taking it more seriously the others soon joined. The games are now the main focal point of the night and participation is eager! No doubt helped somewhat by me being a single dad who has Friday nights free, my house has become the go-to place for a ‘boys night’ but I think the wives and girlfriends quite like that we’re doing something more wholesome than getting sloshed in the pub.

“If a player uses the same Station to help connect cities on several different Tickets, he must use the same route into the city with the Station for all of those tickets. The Train Station owner does not need to decide which route he will use until the end of the game.”

The way understand it is like this: 
• For example, another player has a route from Zurich to Munchen and from Zurich to Paris.
•I have a train station in Zurich 
•at the end of the game I can only use one of the routes (Zurich-Munchen or Zurich-Paris) but never both.

"In general, I'm a bit obsessive about keeping my game boxes and inserts intact and organized. For the most part,even if I think a box is kind of big there's a reason because the board is kind of big or something like that. 

But organizing my games over the weekend made me think that there were some things that could just be optimized a little bit better.

I also have a game called Cranium Pop 5 (it's pretty old) and it's got this big plastic spinning thing that really isn't necessary for the game play. If I got rid of that piece I could put the game in a much smaller box.

"Some strategy games have choices I can make to make the game more difficult for myself (i.e. choosing a difficult race or skills or whatnot). But other games, like Power Grid, are closer to chess. You need to play to get better, and there aren't a lot of ways to ""nerf"" myself. I suppose I could choose dumb starting cities or buy bad powerplants, but then I'm not going to be teaching the game very well, or it'll be pretty obvious that I'm intentionally playing poorly.

Power Grid obviously isn't as complex as chess, but we're also not going to play it nearly as much as someone might play chess. So how do you get the other person to enjoy playing the first one or two learning games in a way that they want to come back and play it again?","How do you guys teach games like Power Grid to new players, without trouncing them and leaving them discouraged?",1,self.boardgames,zl1t4p,wonderbreadofsin,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/zl1t4p/how_do_you_guys_teach_games_like_power_grid_to/,1670953506

"My wife and I had never played modern board games until last Christmas when I got her Ticket to Ride as a gift. I thought it could be a fun activity to play an occasional game and read online that Ticket to Ride is maybe the most common and accessible game. 

We've enjoyed playing and she was happy with the gift, so this year I'm getting her another game. We are still just casual occasional players, so we like games that can be played fairly quickly without tons of complicated rules and can be brought out on a weeknight as a way to relax. But we do enjoy the increase in strategy over the games we grew up playing like Life or Monopoly. 

I've been looking online for games that are accessible, and don't have tons of rules which take a long time to learn. I would like a slight uptick in the level of strategy from Ticket to Ride, since are ready for something just a little more challenging. 

From looking online I've narrowed it down to two options: Splendor or Azul. They both seem pretty failproof in that they seem widely loved, simple rules, can be played with just us two or more if we have friends over, and have some real strategy while still not taking a ton of effort. It seems like Azul is a little bit deeper in strategy which I like, but I'm a little nervous the abstract nature will just feel like playing solitaire or sudoku, which is not really what I'm looking for in a board game. But as I've never played either, nor most games, it's hard to tell. 

Does this seem correct? If so, which would you recommend for us? Thank you for your thoughts! 

Last note- I was considering Pandemic at one point because it's so widely loved, but it seems a little more involved. I worried it was too big of a jump from Ticket to Ride, while Aluz and Splendor seem a little more complex but still easy to play.",Splendor or Azul for Casual Board Gamers,1,self.boardgames,zkyg3c,Lumpy_Ad_6884,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/zkyg3c/splendor_or_azul_for_casual_board_gamers/,1670945347

"I have recently gotten into TTRPGs, and collected all dice I could from the house. In the midst of this, I have found a set of 5 colored wooden dice with peculiar numbers on them:

* Red die: 186 780 681 384 483 285
* Yellow die: 179 971 872 377 773 278
* Blue die: 954 459 657 855 756 558
* Black die: 147 840 741 543 642 345
* Green die: 168 960 762 564 663 366

What I have managed to gather is that the game is about rolling all 5 dice and immediately declaring the sum of the rolled numbers. There is some mathematical trick in there that makes the sum relatively easy to guess, but the name of the game, and thus the origins of these dice in my home elude me.

"**OVERVIEW**

I love social deduction games, and the genre has really flourished over the last decade or so, especially with the arrival of Don Eskridge's The Resistance in 2009.  It took aspects of Werewolf's hidden role playing, but improved on this formula in significant ways.  The Resistance took a further leap forward when a rethemed version came out in 2012, called The Resistance: Avalon. This brought the game into an Arthurian setting, and tweaked some of the rules to make the gameplay more streamlined.  Most people consider Avalon to be the definitive form of the game. Several expansions for The Resistance were subsequently released in the years that followed, some of which applied the improvements of Avalon retroactively to The Resistance, or added new elements to the game.

If you're unfamiliar with the basic concept of Avalon, here's how the back of the box summarizes the gameplay:  ""*This is a game of hidden loyalty. Players are either good, loyal servants of Arthur, or they are aligned with the evil ways of Mordred. Players vote to choose who will go on which quest, but must figure out who they can trust. If the evil players sabotage 3 quests, or assassinate Merlin at the end of the game, Arthur’s kingdom will fall*.""

Now we fast forward to 2021, when a new game appeared from Don Eskridge, entitled Quest. This was in the same Arthurian setting as Avalon, but was a simplified and independent game, with the advantage of being able to cater for as few as 4 players. It also featured gorgeous new artwork by Weberson Santiago.  Along with the release of Quest came a brand new version of Avalon, which is now available separately for the first time under the name [**Avalon: Big Box**](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/367396/avalon-big-box) (2022).

Avalon: Big Box features all-new artwork that matches the artwork used in Quest, and also includes all the expansion modules and extras ever produced for The Resistance, brought into the world of Avalon.  In other words, Avalon: Big Box is the biggest and most complete version of Avalon ever released, and can be considered the definitive and deluxe version of the game.  So let me tell you what you get with this new and expanded edition.

**BASE GAME**

The contents of the box can be divided into two main parts: contents for the base game, and optional contents (i.e. extra characters and expansions). The contents for the base game are basically the same as the original (aside from artwork). 

One thing that is new is the addition of ten double-sided reference cards, which serve as a handy guide to the abilities of all the characters in the game. These are especially useful for when you start bringing in the optional characters into the game.

The instructions consist of a 20 page rulebook, printed in colour.  It starts with a clear overview of all the components, and does a good job of distinguishing between the base game and the optional extras. Six pages cover the rules for the gameplay of the base game, and the final dozen pages cover rules and gameplay for all the optional characters, modules, and variants, including some optional rules and the plot cards.

**OPTIONAL EXTRAS**

Avalon is complete with the base game, but in the Big Box you also get a ton of extra things you can add to the game, including new characters and modules.  The original version of Avalon already included a few optional items, namely 4 extra characters, 2 loyalty cards, and a Lady of the Lake token. Those are included here too, but the vast majority of all these extras are new.

Here's an overview of the main additions and optional variations:

* **Extra characters:** 20 optional character cards introduce special powers and abilities. Also included are small round character tokens which can be used by players to remind them which characters are in the game, and used in discussions.
* **Lancelot variants**: There are two Lancelot characters, a ""Good Lancelot"" and an ""Evil Lancelot"", and when a Switch Allegiance card is drawn, the two Lancelot players secretly switch their allegiances. 
* **Trapper module:** Increases the size of teams that go on a Quest.
* **Messengers module**: Adds Messenger characters that try to collect messenger cards played in earlier Quests to get an advantage in the final Quest.
* **Rogue module:** Adds Rogue characters that have thier own win condition and Quest card.
* **Sorceror module:** Gives selected characters the ability to reverse the result of a Quest.
* **Excalibur variant:** Gives a team member the ability to change the result of a Quest by switching another player's Quest card.
* **Lady of the Lake variant:** Gives a player the ability to look at the loyalty of another player.
* **Plot cards:** Adds extra twists to the game, and are drawn and given to players by the Leader at the start of each Quest. 

**IMPRESSIONS**

**New artwork:** For me this is one of the big appeals of this new edition. Not that there was anything wrong with the artwork from the previous edition. But when I saw this new artwork by Weberson Santiago for the first time, I was instantly in love. I know that there will be people who will want to upgrade their original Avalon to this new version for the sake of the artwork alone, even though the base game is basically unchanged.

**Additional extras:** Besides the new artwork, the real appeal of this new edition is the fact that it is bundled with tons of variants and extras. I haven't been keeping up with all the additions that have been produced for The Resistance over the years, since we've mostly played the base game with Avalon rules, or have stuck to playing Avalon. I also haven't tried all the additional modules yet, but there's no doubt that this is the most complete and up-to-date form of the game, and it's all within one box. There's certainly plenty of options for customizing the game experience to your own style and preference.

**RECOMMENDATION**

The publisher has done everything right in producing Avalon: Big Box (2022). This new version can be considered the definitive version of the game, and is a deluxe edition that contains everything that has ever come out, with tons of possibilities in the box. The base game will serve the needs of most people, because it's excellent. But social deduction games can sometimes become unbalanced, depending on your play group. So having a full toolkit available to customize the experience and tinker with it is welcome. Especially for groups that like adding new twists to their game, there are plenty of options here to try.

Some people will will want this new version because of the new artwork. Others will want it because it has everything Avalon. And still others will want it because they've never played The Resistance or Avalon, and this is the perfect version to get. 

If you love social deduction games and have never played The Resistance or Avalon, then this is a must buy.  So as far as social deduction games go, it is right near the top of the pile.  Fans of games with a high degree of social interaction, discussion, and bluffing should welcome this wonderful new edition.","Impressions of Avalon Big Box - the definitive and deluxe edition of a top social deduction game, with new artwork and extras",1,self.boardgames,zklo07,EndersGame_Reviewer,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/zklo07/impressions_of_avalon_big_box_the_definitive_and/,1670904008

"The short:
Hi all, any advice on opening a small (and I mean SMALL) basically barely making even as the goal, game store out of the front of my house? Thanks! 

The long: 
I semi-own a house, but basically own it for all intents and purposes and can do literally whatever I want with it. 
I was visiting some family in a different city and came across a game store that was being run out of the front of a person's house. It was pretty rad. Granted, their house is on a commercial street, while my house is in a residentially zoned area, so I know I can't do everything they can legally, but I digress. 

I currently have roommates, but in a couple years or so I'll have the option to not. I figure an interesting plan would be to convert the entire front of the house and the two rooms at the front into a game store. The two rooms would be rentable play areas (one medieval themed, the other arcade themed) at like super cheap per hour rates, while the living room area by the front door would be the store space. 
I'd carry the basic stuff (mtg, board games, source materials, figures, etc) in pretty low quantities. 
My hours would be like 4pm to 8pm after I get off of real work and the whole thing would be a side hustle/hobby. 

I think I only need a general business license and to ensure that I'm not disrupting the normal flow of neighborhood traffic. I live very close to the local high school, so that would be my target demographic, and most of them are on foot which is perfect because then there's not potentially a bunch of cars around the neighborhood. I also don't think I would get a lot of customers, which is fine and kinda the point. 
I'd have a strict no loitering policy unless you rent a room, max like 5 people per room, and I think that would dissuade people from trying to hang around a long time. I'd also like to run a weekly D&amp;D session at pretty cheap rates too. I'd probably make it an online storefront as well. 

Has anyone done anything similar, and any thoughts or advice on my ridiculous idea?

"I really dislike co-op board games, I find they’re more toxic than competitive games. When I play co-op board games with my friend group people are extremely rude, but maybe this isn’t a universal experience.

But when I have tried letting others lead me I get told they aren’t holding my hand or what was the point in me bothering to play then. I feel like its doomed if you do, doomed if you don’t.

With competitive games no one will get upset with you because if you do make a mistake its on yourself and thats it.

"Honestly it’s embarrassing to even need to write about this, but here we are lol.

My husband literally always wins at the games we play together. We easily play at least a game a day, and I can count on one or two hands the amount of times I’ve won at any of them. Which is particularly upsetting since we’ve been doing this super consistently for about four months, and even before that we would play more sporadically. So he has won, at an absolute minimum, 100 more games than I have, and I know it’s realistically been more than that. I can’t help but go to the bathroom and cry after every game now because I just feel so, so stupid. And that makes me so sad, because I absolutely love playing board games and was thrilled that, after coming off of many years of anxiety and depression, I had finally found a hobby that actually made me happy. And I still do enjoy playing the games, but right after the game or right before I see my husband about to make a winning move, I just can’t help but be super sad. I also feel like I’m being manipulative by crying, but of the many many many times that I’ve cried, he’s only ever actually seen me cry from it twice. 

I started looking up suggestions for how to change things up so that I could possibly win. One suggestion was to make sure to play games that you enjoyed, which is certainly what I’ve been doing. The second was that some people are better at different types of games, so try out games with a lot of mechanics. My husband and I own a lot of games of a bunch of different types: strategy, action points, bidding, dice rolling, worker placement….the list goes on. So that clearly hasn’t helped me. Another major suggestion I saw was to play coop games. We own a lot of coop games as well, and I feel dumb during those too since he seemingly always knows the best approach, so I just follow along. I also communicate with him a lot about what I think the best move is for my turn in those coop games, but he doesn’t frequently consult me since, again, he always seems to know what’s best.

We even branched out to a computer game, specifically a cooperative one. That didn’t really work out since he has sooo much more experience in those than I do, so I never even feel like I’m really contributing. We tried a competitive Wii game, and that hurt and frustrated me even more since they were my games and I thought I had a really solid chance of winning at least occasionally, but I absolutely did not. We also tried a cooperative Wii game, but that was also frustrating since it seems like he always knows exactly what to do.

We both have played a lot of games growing up, although he always did more complicated ones whereas my family generally stuck to classics like sorry and trouble. 

I had hoped for a long time that buying new games and learning them together would help, but he still always creamed me.

He normally is also the one who reads the directions since he tends to have a bit more time after work, so I’ve been holding onto hope that maybe that’s why I kept losing. Today, though, I finally read the directions and taught the game to him. I still lost three times in a row.

I honestly just don’t know what to do at this point, and I really don’t want to start harboring resentment against my husband or hating board games. :/",Always Losing Board Games,1,self.boardgames,zjnq22,BaBoom6996,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/zjnq22/always_losing_board_games/,1670821080

once all of the cards in the deck are in our hands or discarded, we each get one more turn. that leaves 10 cards unplayed that we only can play two of before the game is supposed to end.

surely there are lucky hands where 8/10 remaining cards are junk, but too often we need those final cards to complete a run. any chance other hanabi players have hit this wall? any advice on achieving that perfect score or are we just going to have to be both lucky and good for the ultimate win?",hanabi two player max score,1,self.boardgames,zjlt2f,dialedin-,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/zjlt2f/hanabi_two_player_max_score/,1670816499

Soo, I'm planning on adding a Dungeon Crawler to my collection since it's severely lacking one; I've played a bunch of them recently and honestly I think the best I've played so far was Immortal Souls (on TTS) so I'll probably buy Ancient Chronicles since by all accounts it's basically an upgrade

"To preface: There are two things that I enjoy with board game nights, (1) getting together with people and (2) as a player I personally like to play non-intuitive strategies. The strategies are ones that I think might be competitive. I think my win-rate in a four-player game is less than 10% (for context), but I love playing board games creatively and it is usually not the most optimal strategy. I of course like winning, but I like having friends who enjoy playing board games more.

Recently I hosted a board game night and was so frustrated/annoyed/upset at the end. I was wondering if other people have ways to handle these situations. There is a friend of a friend who comes to a lot of board game nights with my friends who only cares about winning by any means, which is fine. In the games we play, he plays a pretty well-rounded and somewhat predictable strategy that tries to do a little bit of everything in the game. But then depending on the outcome of the game, when he wins he gloats why his strategy was superior and how everyone else should think more when playing games, and then when he loses he will talk about how everyone else is so much more experienced at the game so it was unfair.

If you happen to use a strategy that is different than his (which basically all of mine are different) he targets you specifically depending on how the game worked out. I happened to win and was harassed for almost an hour about how the only way I could have beaten him was to cheat in the game and how I should just admit to it. I did not cheat and I do not understand why people would cheat, I just committed every resource to a strategy that happened to pay off over the long-haul. I didn't want to ruin the evening for my friends so instead I just kept playing and cried for a little too long after everyone had left.

"Hello fellow Redditors. I’m looking for a card game but I don’t remember it’s name. Few years back (between 2-3,5) I was meandering through www and found a great game (at least at the time I thought it might’ve been great). I didn’t buy it, cause it was sold out (it was one of those crowdfunded projects). What I remember:

Main character was retired soldier or mercenary. It was a solo game. Definitely player could upgrade main character’s equipment.

"Starting with 7 Wonders, I played 5 games with friends last night and we concluded that the victory points gained from the technology tree were so good that no technology card should be passed.  Military cards are very underpowered in comparison, and we generally thought they could be ignored until the last picks.  Veterans of the game, does this align with your experience?

"I played a newish game last night and thought it was hilariously boring considering the time investment, and my experience compared to other BGG reviews.  Does it help the community to post a negative review of the game?  Also, it's nearly impossible to find negative reviews for any board game, but side note.

I wouldn't normally play a game like this due to the mechanics and I'm not sure if it's necessary to tell people about this experience.  The game itself was super boring for me and I kind of want to add my opinion to the BGG reviews since most are positive.

Any of you guys tried this one out? Does it deviate enough from the traditional Monopoly game style to be its own purchase? Are there enough rule changes to make it more fun compared to traditional Monopoly? Is the Mario theming substantial enough to really call it a mario celebration?

"Back in mid-November, I ordered a game from the company that publishes the game on their website.  It said the game was in stock and ready to ship.  I shelled out $200 for a game that I wanted to give my daughter for Christmas.  Normally, I order from retailers like Amazon or Miniature Market, but this was a special Collector's Edition that is only available through their site.

After ordering and seeing that my payment went through, I waited.  Two weeks later I realized that the order had not been shipped.  I immediately assumed it was because they were out of stock.  I wrote the company's support to see if they thought it would be back in stock in time to ship for Christmas.  It turns out they are not out of stock and ""have plenty of copies in the warehouse to ship out.""  They then told me that they were busy working on their next Kickstarter project and would ""get around to shipping items when we have more free time.""

I waited an additional two weeks to give them the benefit of the doubt.  Now I'm beginning to feel like I made a HUGE mistake.

"Hello

I recently got a copy of VEE. Based on the all reviews, it seems likely that the expansion is a must.

My question is do I buy the expansion introduce it in my first game itself? I know the obvious answer is to just play the base game and decide. But first game and impressions are critical, especially when playing with non core gamers.

Second question: reading mixed views on the 6 player capability. Any suggestions to make it exciting and shorter at that player count?

"Kickstarter &amp; Gamefound Campaigns Launching this Week by **ShelfClutter**!

**What is this?**

* A curated shortlist of Campaigns launching in the next 7 days.

* Missing games are normally not intentionally left off the list. It is very difficult to keep track of all upcoming games as information is scattered and release dates are often changing. Feel free to mention them in the comments 🙂
* I also provide a weekly video version of this post covering all the games in more detail + weekly pledge give-aways for viewers 💁‍♂️ Definitely check it out!

##FAQ

**I live in Belize/Canada/Venezuela/USA, why are you posting on a Saturday?!**

Because I'm writing this from Europe in the future where it's already Sunday. Timezones be crazy.

**Why are there a bunch of non-board games in the board game list?**

Because the Tabletop games category on Kickstarter includes anything remotely related to board games and sometimes things slip through my filters.

**Why is this future award winning board game and literal saviour of humanity missing from your list?**

Sometimes my filters get a bit overzealous and discard actually valid projects. If you feel something is missing for this reason, leave a comment and I'll add it (maybe).

**Can I donate all my money to you?**

No

**Can you help me promote my game?**

Please no. I make lists. Nothing more.

**Your list is full of errors and now myspacebardoesn'twork!**

Indeed, this fine piece of code runs purely on not green M&amp;M's, so anything can happen. Leave a comment and I'll see what I can do.

I read the rules multiple times before everyone showed up but when we reached the 20min mark of setup and still had a ways to go, we pulled the trigger and switched to a game half the group knew. 

There are so many “heavy” games that don’t make it to my table simple due to setup! Using Spirit Island as an example, a game I LOVE buts it takes 15+ min to setup and pick spirits even with players who know the game. Another example is Mysterium which is one of my favorite games and honestly one the the best group games IMO. But the setup is too high of a barrier of entry for the average gathering.

A game I think does it right is Parks. The game is setup in &lt;5 min due to how it’s pieces are stored. You are ready to demo mechanics with a practice round in the same amount of time it takes to refill a drink. As a result, it’s become the threshold game of our library. Anything more complex has to be agreed to and setup beforehand.

The first time we played, he remarked about how much he LOVED the game, especially for the chain bonuses and how there isn’t too much interference. He’s the one who almost always suggests we play again. 

He doesn’t like ‘take-that’ style games AT ALL, and prefers game where we both do our own thing and just compare points at the end.

I love the game too! But I’ve walloped him each time, and I’m starting to worry that he way not like/want to play the game any more because he never wins.

"Let me start by saying that I’m an average gamer. I play a board game once a month. Don’t get me wrong, I love a good game to play with semi-serious gamer friends, it’s just that life gets in the way. 

Games I love are Kemet, Container, Spartacus, Azul, Lords of Vegas,… I’m not into hardcore euro games with no real battle mechanics and I’m not a fan of most story driven coop games. Sorry. 😅

These got my attention during my Google and YouTube searches: Scythe, Brass Birmingham, Gaia Project, but I’m not sure if these are for me. I think the art and different vibe is what speaks to me when I look at the box and game (beautiful games are always a plus). Ideally my next game has balanced rules with good interaction (with no long “think pauses” between players) and doesn’t take more than two hours to play. I’m open for recommendations!

"Hello,

I decided to make a mini-version EXIT (we are big fans) for my girlfriend this Christmas. We are the protagonists of the story and it's set in Kyoto where she studies.

I have the story written but the most difficult part is coming up with challenging but fun puzzles (I guess that's why Inka and Markus Brand are geniuses).

Can you help me with your favorite EXIT puzzles or other ideas? Just like in EXIT, the goal of each puzzle is to find three numbers between 1 and 9 in order, this will allow you to check if your solution is correct (I think I'll build a small website to do this instead of the wheel)

The scenes:

1. I can't find my keys in our apartment - for this I was thinking to have a bunch of photos of us in different locations as clue. I'll organize them in a crossword to give a number. (Maybe several numbers?)
2. We are in a convenience store looking for a specific item. I ask the cashier where it is but since I don't speak Japanese well I only hear bits and pieces of what they say. That's the story, but I don't have the puzzle.
3. We are on a bus and I need to pay my fare in exact change - 230 yens. I was thinking to have a cut-out card with coins (5, 10, 50, 100 yen coins) and some sort of combination of these would give the number. Or maybe the back of each coin contains a pattern that gives the number. ANy thoughts on this?
4. I want to get a Japanese fish-shaped dessert (Taiyaki) and we need to navigate in the city to find our favorite Taiyaki stand. I start to hallucinate and see fish everywhere. I was thinking I could have a clue card organizing the fish in a particular shape that would then give the number somehow, but I'm a little clueless about how.
5. We are in a Karaoke room and she forgets the lyrics of her favorite song (?). The puzzle should somehow help her find a number and/or the lyrics. Or just find the number based on the lyrics.

Any ideas or help here would be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much!",Help me!

We have 5 kids, from a 13 year old down to a 1 year old, so we buy 3 games for Christmas. Have been doing this for a few years, it started with just 2 games but we expanded to 3 recently.  
 \- a 2-player (or ""good at 2 player"") game for my wife and I  
 \- a family game for the older kids plus us parents  
 \- a ""younger"" family game (age 5+ maybe)  


This year for example, we are getting Guild of Merchant Explorers for the 2-player game, Roll for the Galaxy for the family game and IceCool 2 For the younger kids game.   


Then we open all three games on Christmas eve, play the youngest game as a family, then send the kids to bed and my wife and I play the 2-player game before finishing any last minute prep before going to bed.

"I recently played Coup with a group of friends who don't play many tabletop games. They loved it. I didn't - because: 

(a) When, for example, someone played Assassin, the person being killed would spend 3 minutes trying to convince the player not to kill them, kill someone else instead. Etc. Each game took 45 minutes and it got tedious for me. They were having so much fun they wanted to keep playing all night. Maybe this point isn't a criticism - just a reflection that we have different preferences. 

(b) There were 5 of us. 3 of them are especially close friends and they formed a clique, ganging up on me and my partner for multiple games in a row. We'd get eliminated first but the game wouldn't end quickly because of (a). It stopped being fun for us at that point. 

I want to encourage their enthusiasm, and find games that are just as accessible and fun for them, which also work better for me and my partner. We'll probably try The Resistance. I understand the hidden roles are randomly assigned, so people will have to team up with different players each time - avoiding cliques. 

Does anyone have recommendations that are NOT social deduction games that might scratch a similar itch for this group?

It’s almost a Perfect Knowledge game. The only randomness is the most distant marbles yet to appear, but 40 marbles are visible (five columns of 8) and you can see your opponents potions, ingredients, and beakers.

Even without the tactile ability (being on BGA) the game is loads of fun and easy to learn and teach. There’s only 8 Potions to learn and only 4 colors for ingredients; red, blue, yellow, and black. It’s even colorblind friendly!

my husband and I really like playing board games when our son goes to bed and we're looking for a new one to get stuck into at Christmas. 

We particularly enjoy playing Terraforming Mars, Ark Nova, Eldorado, occasionally Clank (but not one of our favourites), Birdspan (when we don't have much time), This War of Mine (although we love and hate it at the same time since it seems impossible to win) and Fall of Rome (this gets the least play).

We've recently sold Agricola and Tapestry both for the same reason. We enjoyed them but there are so many different strategies that the amount of time you have to play dosen't allow for. Therefore, it's insanely frustrating to identify a strategy but then run completely out of time to even half see it through.

"I have a game coming up tomorrow and I am looking for clarifictaion on the rules for lone Generals. Got some help on BGG but still not clear.  

**I think I am clear about the following:** 

**LG moving into a space containing an enemy LG** 
The LG may move through a location with an enemy LG but may not end his movement there (10 G).  

**LG moving into a space containing an enemy army** 
If the target space contains an enemy army and no CUs friendly to that LG, then disperse the LG (10 I).  

* LG may Withdraw (a little unclear but 10G talks about LG withdrawal).  
* LG may Evade (10 F)  
* LG may Force March (6.2 B.1)  


**I am still unsure about the following:**

**LG may Intercept**  
(11.2) states 'For each space you want to try to Intercept from, declare which of your Generals will try to Intercept, and which Subordinate Generals, CUs, and controlled Royal Family Members the Intercepting General will bring with him if he succeeds.'
That seems to indicate that a General could choose to bring zero CUs.  
It seems odd to me that a LG can intercept but the rules seem to indicate that is the case.  

A successful interception should lead to a Land Battle BUT (14) states 'A Land Battle resolves a clash between two Factions whose CUs are in the same location, if the CUs cannot be Overrun.'
We don't have CUs in the same location: we have an LG and an enemy army (and Overruns only happen if If the moving Faction’s CUs outnumber the other Faction’s CUs in the target space by at least 5 to 1.)  

**Q:** I am not sure what happens next? (though dispersion of the LG seems logical).

**LG may be Intercepted**  
**Q:** As above, I am not sure what happens next? (though dispersion of the LG seems logical).  

**Q:** Can a LG move into a space containing only enemy CUs (no enemy Generals)?

- Optionally increase (e.g. +1) an army movement through the board when a leader is present on it.
- Introducing some light siege warfare mechanics (e.g. from Crusarder Dex)

"Played Villainous over a year ago with 2 other people, loved how I had to play my board, but hated how much downtime I had. I read that some people use the downtown to talk about non-game related stuff, shoot the shit, or just watch TV. But I bring two points A) Personally, when I'm playing games I want to talk about the game and immersed in it. And B) I don't think Villainous is like Carcassonne for example where you CAN take it easy because it's just one action. No. Here you have to really think about what you're doing and anything else will be a distraction. 

On top of that, some sadist put this game as ""Can be played with 6 people"". Has anyone EVER tried it with 6 people? This might be approaching Monopoly type of cruelty. Unless I'm missing some rule, we all do things one at a time, which means you have to wait for 5 people to finish their turn before you go again.

Yeah, I guess you can talk in those 10 minutes it'll take before it's your turn again. Multiply that by what? 40+ turns, and you got yourself a nice 7 hour game 🥲

On the other hand.. Solo is quick as hell and so much fun! I just played it and HAD to write about it!

The rules are simple. 

1. Finish the game under 20 turns (15 if you're an expert)
2. Roll a D10 at the end of your turn, 1-4 you draw a fate card. 

That's it.

You don't have to wait for anyone, you can just keep playing. Perfect rainy Sunday morning game.

"Ever since I first became familiar with this game, I loved the idea of it. Bribing the sheriff and smuggling contraband is an exciting premise for a game. As I’ve seen it played, however, there is a problem that keeps coming up….

Why is the sheriff paying other players simply because they don’t have illegal goods? Not only does this make little story-sense, but it is yet another incentive to play the game without lying or smuggling, which is kind of the whole point (you’re doing this to help Robin Hood, remember?).

Players should be incentivized to take risks and to bribe the sheriff. Instead, the favored strategy is “baiting” the sheriff into searching a legal shipment, because he pays you. It creates an incentive that warps the game heavily.

I don’t think the game should favor the lowest risk strategy like that. And so, it suddenly hit me what the solution is: Instead of the Sheriff paying the penalty to the players, it should go back to the “bank” representing their time wasted and opportunity cost for searching the wrong shipment.

"Hey everyone!  


Like many, the COVID lockdowns acted as something as a ""kick in the butt"" to finally get a creative project started. With me working from home, unable to go anywhere, and sitting around not doing much, I thought it was high time that I got started on my game design journey, something that I'd flirted with for nearly 5 years.  


Inspiration originally came from games that I loved, like **Blood Rage**, **Cthulhu Wars**, and other ""troops on a map"" games. However, it felt like I was simply riffing off of their designs and not creating anything unique or interesting on my own.  


In the end, what inspired me most was trying to design a game in a genre I had generally disliked. Whenever someone mentioned programming, I thought of **Robo Rally**, a game that was a complete miss for me (I can appreciate what it does more now, but I would still refuse to play it). I always felt that many programming games were arbitrarily punishing and random. However, I loved the idea of playing robots, and programming naturally goes hand in hand with them. With that, I set out with a goal: make a programming mechanism in a game that I actually really, really enjoyed.  


After nearly 3 years of design and development (and various evolutions of the programming mechanism, some of which fell into the same traps that I hated), I have finally reached the point of crowdfunding: **SCRAP**, an asymmetric 3X game of programming and hand-management, is on its way to being published, after hundreds of playtests and thousands upon thousands of hours of work.  I'd love for you to check it out here: [https://gamefound.com/projects/jolly-swagman-games/scrap](https://gamefound.com/projects/jolly-swagman-games/scrap)  


In addition, what's a mechanism you generally hate, and what's a game that you feel does the mechanism brilliantly? One of the next games I intend on working on is an adventure-exploration game, because I, once again, generally don't enjoy them, so I'd love to make a game that I enjoy in that genre.",I'm not a fan of programming games...so I made one that I (and hopefully many) will love!,1,self.boardgames,zgcq0o,JustAModestMan,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/zgcq0o/im_not_a_fan_of_programming_gamesso_i_made_one/,1670535871

Of course there is a threshold for a game being ‘solved’, since chess is probably solvable, but today no entity can provide a sequence of moves that always wins (as even the proof would be impossible to create).

"My partner and I have recently started playing board games and were introduced by friends.

 It’s been great, but when playing with these friends they don’t really play for fun, they play to win and if they don’t, then everyone knows about it.

If we mess up on a rule (which happens as we are new) it becomes very serious. If they have a worse position throughout the game, they get upset. If they lose, they’re visibly frustrated. They have arguments that you think are just pretend arguments but nope, they’re real and create an atmosphere which isn’t very comfortable.

It shows me that board games are amazing, but having a group that doesn’t take it so seriously that it impacts everyone else’s enjoyment is so important.","Who you play with is as important, if not more important than what you play.",1,self.boardgames,zg6gkv,TealDove1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/zg6gkv/who_you_play_with_is_as_important_if_not_more/,1670522906

Hey guys!

I just got the new shelf delivered and after arranging everything I was so ennamored with how it looks that I wanted to share in my excitement :)

* How long have you been involved in the hobby?

Well, hard question to answer. I played MTG from like my 13s to my 25s. Does that count? Probably not, as I wasn't really collecting ""boardgames"" but just one game. I've always been quite a bit into video games, but the last 5 years I go into cycles where I play video games for like 6 months and am super into boardgames for the other 6 months. That's been going on for the last 3 years or so.

* My collection from top to bottom

Title | Number of Plays | Comments
Broom Service | 4 | This Pfister game gets overlooked a lot, but beneath it's cutesy looks and deceptible simple rules, there's a cuthroat and very tactical game. Everytime we played it people get it midway though. It makes for great banter and it's legit fun to play every single time. I still have not managed to play any of the more complex variants, which I'm very much looking forward to.
Anachrony | 3 | Got this years ago, and even though it doesn't have nearly as many plays as I would like to, it's probably the favorite in my collection. It's just.. heavy. Which is not a problem for me, but my fiancè didn't quite like it, so 2 player games are off. I kinda dread the teach. It's a bit too long. Buuuut I'm playing it tonight at the weekly meetings! Super excited!
Lost ruins of Arnak | 5 | I really like this game, and I'm holding off on the expansion. I played the expansion on TTS once and even though I enjoyed the new boards and extra cards, I'm not a huge fan of the assymetric powers. I don't necessarily think the game needed it? But the game is fun, and thinky but not too thinky, so it occupies a very different spot in my collection, with a very different complexity level.
Kanban EV | 1 | The newest addition (with Terra Nova) to my collection, as I got it in a Black Friday deal. I was looking forward to get at least 1 Lacerda, and even though I would've probably gravitated more to On Mars personally, my fiancè has a weight tolerance and I feel like On Mars would've been just too much. She really enjoyed this one though, so I'm extremely pumped to play and discover this game more and more!
Guild Master | 3 | I absolutely love the theme but I understand this game might not be for everyone. I adore the production and the replayability though, and I am impressed with how balanced it is! I am still on the lookout for the right group to play this game, and if I find it, I can see this being one of our favorites!
Chess (tucked to the side) | ?? | The OG. Played this a ton as a kid and we played a fair amount with my SO the last year. It always deserves a spot on the shelf.
Great Western Trail (1st ed) | 5 | Another game that I want to play more and more. Love this game, and I'm a bit conflicted that there's a new, shinier version out there that I don't have. I'm also attracted to the Argentina version, as I was born there. Let's see if I ever get a really good deal to upgrade it, but so far my copy is totally functional (with the house rule of extra cards for players 2-3-4 and maybe the Kansas city delivering just 4).
Eldritch Horror (+Forsaken Lore, Cities in Ruin and Dreamlands) | 6 | The only game I have that I truly enjoy playing solo. Most of the games where with other people though. And it's also my only ""event game"", since it's quite long usually. I adore the stories that unfold as the play goes along. Even if we haven't won yet. Not even once.
The Crew | 6 | Everyone seems to like it more than I do. It's probably my least favorite game in my collection, but I would play it if others want to.
Res Arcana | 3 | I need to play this more to determine better whether I like it or not. It's a really pretty box though!
Terra Nova | 1 | Terra Mystica FOR BABIES. No jokes aside, this feels like Terra Mystica (which I played a couple of times) on a complexity level that my SO and eventually my kids will enjoy a lot more. The only play we had my SO went ""I really liked this!"", which feels my heart with joy, since future 1v1s seem all the more likely to happen. And it played lighting fast. First game 1v1 was over in less than an hour (1.30 with the teach). I am extremely happy with this game which I got essentially free on Black Friday.
Pandemic Legacy Season 1 | 4 | We left this one mid-way through. We need to go back to it, if anything so that I can get rid of it and put something else in its place!
Concordia Venus | 3 | One of my first Euro loves. I had played it YEARS ago before I was actually collecting and I got around to buy it just recently. It's another game that my SO really liked, although I'm not so sure about the 2p game. I am always impressed by how elegant this design it. There is no fat in this game, everything serves a purpose and it's super tight. 
Ark Nova | 3 | Fantastic 2p game. I might try it once at 3, but no more than that, as I don't feel the experience getting better... just longer. This one I bought kind of blind because of all the hype and it ended up being a big hit with my SO. I'm still not convinced I love it, but I definitely like it, and if she wants to play I'll always be down for it!
Taverns of Tiefenthal | 0 | We got this as a gift x-mas 2019 and I still haven't gotten around to learn and play it. I'm not super drawn to it but I want to try it at least once before I sell it. I already took the wrapper off, even though the cardboard is still not punched through haha...
Dixit | ?? | This was my gateway game. When I was living in Italy a friend invited me to play games. We played this and some other stuff I don't remember, but Dixit was the one that stood out. Then I told him I'd be down whenever and in other chances we played Puerto Rico. This was about 8 years ago, and was the seed that sprouted into this whole collection.
Quacks | 8 | This one is always a hit. It's just a fun game. Doesn't matter if you win or lose, it's just fun. Played this one as recently as yesterday! I'm considering getting acrylic or wooden chips though, since cardboard doesn't necessarily mix super well in the bags..
Trans-Europa/Trans-America | 4 | Ticket to Ride for Euro lovers. Took me a bit of effort to find this copy, but so far it's always been a hit, so well worth it. The only thing I don't like is that this version the components are made of plastic, versus the copy I first played had wooden bits which felt much better. This is one of the only games I played once and made me think ""I need to buy this"" almost immediately. Not so much because I loved it, but I knew my friends and family would love it (and they did!)
Cascadia | 2 | I kinda let myself fall for this game's hype. My SO really liked it but I'm a bit lukewarm to be honest. Needs more play to see if there's a place for this one in my collection (even though the box and the production are beautiful).
Splendor | 6 | Surprise! There's two more games! Splendor's yellowy box was not meshing with everything else I had so I put it in the drawer. Great gateway game, which I have brought to the table with great success, and it makes for a snappy 1v1 game. This kind of competes with Cascadia for me, even though they play quite differently they have a similar complexity and depth. I enjoy Splendor a lot more though.
Codenames | 8 | Everyone has it. I do to. My only party game so far. Nothing to say that hasn't been said

* What left/is on its way out

As I mentioned, **Res Arcana**, **Taverns** and **Cascadia** are in the chopping block, although I want to play all of those more to make up my mind.

So far the only game I ever got rid of was **Spirit Island**. I found the puzzle too samey and mechanic, without emerging storytelling and too abstract. And even though I know I could've kranked up the difficulty more, I found it too easy. At least up to difficulty 4 or 5. Never lost a game (although we realized the first 1-2 games we played a rule wrong, which got corrected in subsequent plays). Anyways, after about 6 plays I decided I liked, but not loved the game. Hence, was out. I realized that if I want to play something thinky and long, I want it to be a competitive game. Co-op I like swingy and unpredictable. I am slowing considering Atlantis Rising, but I would like to play it first. There's also a copy of *Sequence* and *Slate* that we got as gifts. I don't think I would be able to sell those so I might have to just dump them. 

* What is coming in?

And the only kickstarter I absolutely want to partake on is *Scholars of South Tigris*. I played the game on TTS twice and it's absolutely fantastic. This game actually convinced me to go for the entire trilogy and so I have ordered a copy of *Wayfarers of South Tigris*, which is the only thing currently on its way. Wayfarers I only managed to play solo once, and it felt a bit long but ok. Not sure if I'm going to love it, but Scholars is a heavy, crunchy, thinky euro that did a couple of things I haven't quite personally seen before. That's a ways off though! I have a couple of games in my radar, like *Rajas of the Ganges*, the afore mentioned *On Mars*, and the new version of *Terra Mystica age of innovation*. But first of all, it has to fit to the shelf, and I want to keep the collection more or less focused. 

I already feel like most of my games I want to play more off, so buying more games feels a bit counter-intuitive at this point. I should probably try to focus on getting a nice group going, since we just moved to a new city. All of that combined to the fact that our first daughter was just born last week, means that I really need to squeeze as much value of my games as possible. But on the bright side, on 7-9 years from now I'll ~~force~~ wish my family to play more with me.

"I'd say I have a ready good chance of having ADHD, which means simple games like these with apparently no other skill needed other than tactical intuition, should give me a good time.

Except, at least in BGA, all they gave me are bad experiences through and through!

For instance Splendor. Who knew not aiming for any noble can still make you win? How am I supposed to compete against someone who has hours of experience in this game and likely has memorized all the cards and combinations? 

I'm a simple man: 
Flashy+big value=good. 
Winning is good, losing is bad; very very bad. Winning through many tear-filled games is bad; tell me everything on how to win now and I'll be happy. What worked to that guy last game, it must work with me this game. 

And so on, and so forth. I think you can see why I'm terrible at board games in general.

Same goes to some other ones like 7 Wonders or Welcome To, even bigger stuff like, say, Wingspan, Stone Age or Tapestry.

Sure, got some lucky wins, but sometimes it's a near miss (which I can accept for someone who just played, like, less than 10 games), or a full-on stomp (as in, the next in line is 1.5 times my score).

Is there something specific I should work on if I want to get good in games like these, or it's just that games that require more startegic planning than rock-paper-scissors aren't for me?",How exactly do you win a game like Century or Splendor?,1,self.boardgames,zf44yk,rtanada,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/zf44yk/how_exactly_do_you_win_a_game_like_century_or/,1670427468

"Encouraged by the post a couple days ago about year-end lists, here are some of my favourite moments while playing games over the last year:

**10.** **Bottom of the 9th**

My friend and I played this recently. Both of us play in a softball league so it was a fun to recreate some of our summer highlights on the table. All game we were trying to psych each other out with pitching/swinging choices. After a series of hits I managed to get two outs while he had the bases juiced and was facing my relief pitcher. He hit and we immediately start rolling our dice. I get him out at first by a fraction of a second and leave the field victorious.

(technically the game goes into extra innings in the game's lore but I definitely won)

**9.  The Godfather: Corleone's Empire**

I got this game in order to play with my father but I did a test run with a couple of friends. This was my first Eric Lang title and first game that has area control as a more central focus. I put on a Sicilian soundtrack and we were off, shaking down businesses and offing each other in drive-bys. I was wary about this game feeling too mean for the people I was playing with, but having your thugs get offed in this game isn't super catastrophic and just contributed to the hilarity of the game.

**8. Happy Salmon**

Like another game on this list, Happy Salmon is a way to bring chaos into a social setting, but is concentrated in bursts of about 60 seconds. I played this one 8-player on a camping trip and then shortly after at a family gathering with a bunch of nieces and nephews. Both times it was an instant way to fill everyone with excitement, with one nephew getting bodychecked to the ground while too many people were attempting to switch places at the same time. After getting a noise complaint, we played it ""silently"", which was equally as wild and hilarious.

**7. Modern Art**

Sometimes I will bring a small selection of games to a gathering and let the group pick what we play. In this case, I felt a bit nervous that we picked the wrong game early on, as we were playing with a couple of non-gaming new parents with their infant in the room. But this ended up being a blast. Everyone took time to talk up the paintings they were auctioning and their possible interpretations/relevance to contemporary art, as well as their value. I had found some tiny easels at an art store which helped cultivate the art museum vibe. In the end I somehow eked out a victory by only $1 (thousand).

**6. Western Legends**

Somehow I managed to get a few non-gamer friends to play this with me. We played a 5 player game and everyone was navigating the sandbox a little differently. After getting arrested early in the game, I was trying to not go too hard on either the Wanted or Marshal tracks, buying myself a donkey and trying to live like a reformed honest gold miner (though I had plans to rob the bank after my final deposit). Things didn't quite work out how I'd intended but luckily they didn't for my opponents either; in a wild ending, the person who was looking like the clear winner for much of the game proceeded to lose three straight hands of poker to the dealer, despite having good cards.

**5. Resist!**

Never before has a board game brought tears to my eyes. 

I had originally been a bit skeptical of Space-Biff's review of this game, and thought that his conclusions about how this game connected the player with the protagonists were probably a bit exaggerated. But when playing my first game of Resist, it was agonizing to have to send these anti-fascist fighters, everyday people, to the uncertain fate of the ""revealed"" pile. It probably made a difference that I've been invested in anticapitalist politics for a long time and was familiar with the history of the Spanish maquis. I believe I managed the second-lowest victory level, but that's what is so moving about this game: there really isn't a victory, at least not in the way we normally conceive of it in war games. These people are fighting because they refuse to submit, knowing full well that many of their friends and family have died before them. And so it tortured me to reveal my last few cards to win one final location, but somehow I knew it's what they would have wanted. Can't wait to play it again.

Also, one of few games where deckbuilding as a mechanic makes actual thematic sense to me.  


**4. Spells**

Over the past year I designed and playtested my own game, Spells, a thematic word game that's kind of a mash up between Quest for El Dorado, Boggle, and Paperback. I had my very first playtest at the start of the year and, though the game clearly needed a lot of work at that point, it is such a magical feeling to watch people immerse themselves into a world you've created and have fun with it. The particular experience that makes this list, though, was at a playtesting event in June. I was playing the game with two strangers who had a bit of experience in the game industry (and who weren't obliged to be as polite as the family and friends I'd played with previously). 

The game tries to balance the actual spelling of words (casting Spells) with spatial movement and choices about when to upgrade one's tools, as well as when/where to cast the right spells. One of the players scored a huge amount of points with an amazing word while he was next to the Syllabic Serpent, granting him bonus points for every syllable in the word. Upon seeing this, the other player figured his only shot was to beeline for the finish and secure the first place bonus. This meant the first player wouldn't make it to the end unless he conjured a broomstick and used it's power every turn (which, in this case, meant using a word with a J). In the end, the player who finished first won a very close game, and immediately after we counted our points they told me I should start thinking about publishing. \*Such\* a good feeling.

If you want to stay in the loop about print and play files, playtesting opportunities, and generally where this game is going, you can sign up for an email list [here](https://tinyletter.com/nonnogames) and follow it on [BGG](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/362022/spells).

**3. Scopa**

There's not much that can get my Nonna excited anymore. Since her husband, my Nonno, passed away about 15 years ago she's basically been waiting to die. We celebrated her birthday recently and I brought along a deck of Italian cards a friend had given me. Her memory has been spotty lately and so I wasn't sure how well playing a card game would go, but I watched a video on how to play Scopa before dinner. After we ate she was doing her usual routine of saying she had to leave, but I said that I wanted to play a game with her. After a bit of pressure she finally agreed and she perfectly remembered how to play. The scoring was still a bit unfamiliar to me but she would quickly count up her points and immediately know how much I had. I smoked her, but she quickly reshuffled the deck and started dealing out the cards to play **Briscola**. She utilized the advanced strategy likely familiar to Nonnas all over of not explaining how the scoring worked and obliterated me.

It warmed my heart to see her excited to do something and had me reflect on the role games play in our lives. As a woman in her late 80s, she may be getting rusty at all sorts of things, but she remembered how to play games.

Also, Scopa is interesting and I can see how for a game that's over 400 years old it was way ahead of its time.

**2 . Eclipse: Second Dawn for the Galaxy**

It's round 7, the game is nearing its end. After a couple minor conflicts early in the game, the tension is ratcheting up as the two leading players hone their focus on the galactic centre and begin upgrading their immense militaries. Meanwhile, I'm just trying my darndest to avoid looking like a threat. I've got three ships on the board, and haven't shown much interest in playing offensively. I intentionally order my turns so that I remain inconspicuous, even making inefficient choices so that I can delay showing my hand. Once my opponents have rendered themselves unable to meaningfully change their plans, I build my souped-up dreadnauts and send ships into my opponent's unguarded home system. While my opponents wreck each other in the galactic centre, I take over the system and increase my economic output. Finally, in the last round I go through two fleets of my opponents' ships without taking a single casualty, claiming the galactic centre and winning the game.

This was my third time playing Eclipse and it was so much fun discovering new layers to the game. While I've yet to play TI, and I know Eclipse is effectively beige by comparison, it was so cool to notice that I needed to obfuscate my intentions from my opponents in order to succeed, making this way more than the pure economics game that some may paint it as.

**1. Don't Get Got**

Bringing out Don't Get Got transformed a holiday weekend with family into a 72 hour game. There were ten of us playing and we held onto our wallets the entire time, ""getting"" each other while having dinner, grocery shopping, out doing yard work, or playing other games. Players varied in age from 10 to 70 but everyone was equally committed to the game and it made for an incredible experience.

I won't spoil any of the secret missions by giving highlights, but let's say there were grandparents putting themselves in compromising positions, grandchildren being needy, and grown adults falling to the floor in order to complete their missions. Once we were all a bit suspicious of each other, it would mean there would have to be multi-step set-ups for to complete a mission. It was the first thing the kids were thinking about each morning as they tried to get their parents and aunts/uncles before they'd had their coffee.  I would imagine there are some groups with whom this game wouldn't quite work, but it was perfect for this extended family gathering and put everyone in a fun mood.

\---------------

*Honorable Mentions*

**No Thanks**  
Always feels good when you get an ""I like this game"" when playing with people who aren't very into games.

**Castles of Burgundy**  
Got a little stoned and competed to soup up our respective duchies. Such a fun, laid-back experience.

**Regicide**  
Introduced this game to a couple family members and we played it a handful of times over the course of a weekend, trying to make our way through all the royals.  
We didn't end up winning any of those campaigns but it was so satisfying trying to work as a team and hearing people want to play it again and again.

"It was one of those party games ""as suggested from a book of games"" (the bgg mentions this).  The game is played in a room full of x people (probably 10 to 30 or something).  At the start of the game, people receive 2 envelopes: 1 full of random tokens and 1 containing a Rule that tells you how to score.  There are about 10 to 15 rules all in all.

So the goal is to mingle and negotiate, trading rules and tokens until you have a general idea of what you need to get the highest score possible given what you have.  I think there's a variation where there's a ""cauldron"" in the middle/where the host is where you can ""cook"" tokens and they give different points depending on the state of things.

"So far I have only seen neutral to positive reviews, but the game was not as enjoyable as I expected. We played out of the box at first, and then later played a few games using the Adventuring Party decks. True to the name of catacombs, it is extremely easy to get lost and perish down under. Points do not matter if you cannot exit the depths, or run out of health. Gold barely matters in this version (everyone's main focus was on trying to survive). It is hard to accumulate gold and the market items feel uninspiring.

Returning to the Crypt is almost impossible as the routes are far and difficult, &gt;! especially when you reveal the rotating tile cards. To me, freeing the prisoners are a trap and a waste of lock picks.

"Are they same on the story just different gameplay? like is the only difference that the board game obviously have some mini figures etc and the card game focuses on cards only? 

i was informing myself and i didnt planned on buying billion expansions but i really really love the art style so what would you recommend me for a one time purchase? 

the third version of the board game where i read many comments its a good starter entry 

or the card game? or are both filled with millions of expansions? 

like i only care for 1 good core game with good value.Thanks for your help!",Arkam Horror third edition vs Card game.

"I had to get a new phone yesterday because my screen was acting up. I went from Android to Android and I had everything transferred over and it even tried to install as many apps as possible. Well, it doesn't tell you which apps it can't install just the number. I had 6 that did not install. One of them is the BGG app that I have been using for years, it was a white icon with the head of the BGG dude on it. I have been looking for hours trying to find it. It isn't available anymore and I don't even see a new one available in the App store. Does anyone know what happened to the App?

"This list is the ""Top 20"" in a couple different ways:

* The 20 games I played the most
* The 20 games that stood out to me the most this year

While half of my 20 most played games were new to me this year, and 45% of my logged plays were games that were new to me, I only played about 7 or so games that were published in 2022, so I cannot speak to the best games published this year.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's jump to a list! My play count list is naturally going to be skewed towards short repeatable games, because many of these saw multiple games per session. Some of my more memorable experiences I only played a few times.

&amp;#x200B;

|Game|Comments|
|:-|:-|
|[Star Realms](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/147020/star-realms) \- 90 Plays|An old classic for my wife and I. We are pretty well matched, and we certainly have our own meta. The phone app makes this one just so fast and easy to play. I started logging plays years after we started playing this game, so while this is my most played game for sure, I have over 1,000 rounds logged on the app, and less than 10 of those were with another opponent.|
|[Fantasy Realms](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/223040/fantasy-realms) \- 84 Plays|This game was new to us this year, and man it took us by surprise. I was interested to try it, but did not expect the 2 player variant to be so accessible, enjoyable, and fun. We got this game in June I think and usually play 2 or 3 times each time it comes out. We have the new edition as well, but because we logged so many rounds in the old version, we have some fondness for it.|
|[Similo](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/268620/similo) - 42 Plays|This was a late '21 acquisition, and it shoots so high up the list because it is so fast to play and replay. We found that playing with 2 different decks enhances the experience for us: for example I use the mythological figures deck to give clues for the wild animals deck. This obscures some of the meanings, but that guess-work is half the fun.|
|[6 nimmt!](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/432/6-nimmt) / Take 5 - 33 Plays|New to us this year, despite being a 1995 release. This game is such a banger at so many player counts. There is a remarkable amount of tension, dread, and relief to be had in this simple game. I have played from 3 players to 7 players and had fun each time. Sometimes you get bad luck, sometimes it's phenomenal, but it's always fun.|
|[No Thanks!](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/12942/no-thanks) \- 25 Plays|I find this to be similar to 6 nimmt in that it's just a few cards with numbers (and in this case some tokens too), but the game is remarkable stressful and delightful. Those moments when everyone knows that one person is going to take the card, but they keep sending it round again to milk a few more tokens from everyone else are such delightful moments for me. You know they're just squeezing you, and you're helping them, but you don't want those points. Good stuff. |
|[Kluster](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/277458/kluster) \- 23 Plays|I found this game through a No Rolls Barred recommendation video, and was surprised with how much fun this experience is, as well as how easily people get into the game. The rules are simple and easily understood, but there is so much anticipation and dread in squeezing one more magnet into the string. I recommend you give the string (at least) one twist to create more than 1 play area. This forces players pieces closer together and helps build those tense moments.|
|[SpaceShipped](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/283792/spaceshipped) - 22 Plays|I dove into solo games this year as a way to explore games without needing to wait for other people to have the time / interest / energy to play. Spaceshipped from ButtonShy was one of my favorites. There's certainly some bad luck that can sink you, but the satisfaction of building up resources, buying low and selling high is one that has kept me coming back.|
|[Crokinole](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/521/crokinole) - 18 Plays|A generous Christmas gift last year, Crokinole, like Kluster and Klask, draws people in, is (relatively) quickly understood, and very accessible to less-experienced game players. The size definitely limits how often this game gets played because it's a pain to lug around, but I don't think I've sat down for just one play yet. |
|[Wavelength](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/262543/wavelength) \- 18 Plays|The app version of this game shot this one up our list significantly. The physical version is fantastic, but the app is at least as good in my eyes. This sort of fits into a Jackbox type experience, but this usually see's multiple games played each sitting and lots of laughs as well.|
|[Star Wars: Jabba's Palace – A Love Letter Game](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/353470/star-wars-jabbas-palace-love-letter-game) \- 18 Plays|Love Letter has been a classic for me and my wife for a few years now. If I totalled my plays of all versions of Love Letter it would have been at #5. There's something lovely about the simple mixture of luck and deduction and the simple choices in theses games. For us, Jabba's Palace is a great spin on a very familiar experience. Many of the cards are changed in interesting ways. The system that changes end-game scoring is interesting when combined with card factions because it changes motivations for what to hold or play. I don't think I would recommend this as the first Love Letter game to play, but it has topped the category for us this year.|
|[Deep Space D-6](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/183571/deep-space-d-6) - 15 Plays|Another solo experience. This dice-chucking luck-mitigation game is one that was just the right mix of fast &amp; casual and thinky &amp; serious for me. Plus I'm a sucker for the sci-fi theme.|
|[Unsurmountable](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/331328/unsurmountable) - 14 Plays|This solo game I am hot and cold on. The luck of the draw can make the experience be satisfying and puzzley, and it can also feel impossible.|
|[Sprawlopolis](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/251658/sprawlopolis) - 13 Plays|This is a fun little puzzler that can be solo or multiplayer, but is probably best solo. There's some (basic) math to the scoring, but the variations in scoring conditions make this a great time. It's fun to figure out how to pack types together while not increasing the number of roads.|
|[Lux Aeterna](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/282439/lux-aeterna) \- 13 Plays|Another solo-sci-fi game about mitigating damage and fighting fires (vaguely like pandemic in spirit but not in mechanisms). I like the competing priorities of this game: ""If I fix this, that breaks, so I can keep them both afloat this turn, but I need to fix something"". You can play with a timer, but I prefer the more peaceful experience and I like the art.|
|[Strike](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/123570/strike) - 13 Plays|Very recent, but push-your-luck is a delightful mechanism that is fun regardless of your gamer-creds which means I've enjoyed this with my game group and my in-laws. This also generates multiple plays per session, I think because the slight dexterity element makes you feel like, ""I could do better if I just throw the dice right!"".|
|[Viticulture Essential Edition](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/183394/viticulture-essential-edition) \- 9 Plays (I am also lumping Viticulture World into these plays)|A worker placement classic for my wife and I. We occasionally get people together for Viticulture &amp; Vino and jump into some tense and competitive games. We also added Viticulture World this year, and dang is that difficult. We won on the promotional-tutorial (extra-easy) difficulty, but have lost 3 times on easy. The cooperative version we definitely do not have figured out yet.|
|[Furnace](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/318084/furnace) \- 8 Plays|A little resource conversion cube pusher with a unique bidding system. This game just checks a box for my brain that is so satisfying. ""I can get 4 coal from this. 2 iron from that. Oh and I need an iron and an oil for that."" The AI bot for 2 player is simple to run (it just jams up the bidding), but this game is fun at 2, 3, &amp; 4 and I expect will continue to see plays in next year.|
|[Cobra Paw](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/220700/cobra-paw) \- 8 Plays|A fast dexterity game that is well liked in our group. We have one person who is (nearly) undefeatable, but a villain to strive against can be fun sometimes.|
|[Harry Potter: Hogwarts Battle – Defence Against the Dark Arts](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/254192/harry-potter-hogwarts-battle-defence-against-dark) - 8 Plays|Quite similar to Star Realms, but with a lot of momentum, my wife and I have a few rules modifications we've made to make this suit our tastes better. We almost entirely ignore hexes because that mechanism is centered around NOT playing the game, and we've added rules to allow for paying to clear out some of the trade row as well as some rubber-banding for round losers to help balance the swinginess. The result may run a bit longer than as-designed, but we like it a lot more for it.|
|[For Sale](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/172/sale) \- 8 Plays|Not much to say except that this game is excellent. The bidding in the first half is great for trying to egg your opponents on, and the bidding in the second half is a bit lucky at times, but the experience of making the most of what you have is great.|

&amp;#x200B;

List Number 2!

The 20 games that stood out to me this past year but were not my top played:

|Game|Comments|
|:-|:-|
|[Maquis](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/148729/maquis)|WW2, Worker-Placement(ish), Solo. This has been a fun one to puzzle out. There is definitely a learning curve and some card counting strategy I need to improve at to not get my butt kicked on easy mode. The competing priorities kept this one in my mind. I failed often with a ton of time left to spare, so I think I was also rushing a bit.|
|[Paperbag Dungeon: Mind the Mushrooms](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/368740/paperbag-dungeon-mind-mushrooms)|Super simple solo game with the most basic version of the rules: just make a maze. This was a peaceful experience. For a bit more puzzle, add in a few rules about monster routing and card flipping, etc. In a way I am procedurally generating the dungeon, but it's a fun little route tracing experience.|
|[Dream Crush](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/315059/dream-crush)|Whoo boy this is fun with the right crowd. It is a hoot to reveal the (often) undesirable traits of the dates and take guesses at your friends, but (like anything I suppose) a player who is not interested in embracing the dating game-show vibe can tamp down the excitement a bit. I fully expect to run out of score-sheets next year and have to transition to 3x5 cards.|
|[Hansa Teutonica: Big Box](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/286749/hansa-teutonica-big-box)|This was one of those games that I bought because I was pretty sure I would like it, but took me a long time to get it played. The result though is a fantastic game of jamming up your friends routes and upgrading your engine. I don't have the strategy for this one nailed, but I am happy to keep trying out options. I have made assumptions about what would be a good / bad strategy, only to see other people use those strategies to success. I think this game is excellent, especially at 4 or 5.|
|[Cheating Moth](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/105593/cheating-moth)|The sales pitch that first got me to break away from Catan and buy Cosmic Encounter (my first foray into hobby board games), was The Filch: a player power that allows you to cheat by stealing cards until you get caught, and then you can keep cheating but now the cards are placed in front of you and everyone else has to keep watch while the rest of the game goes on. This was so wild an idea that I had to see what else Cosmic Encounter had in store (and I am glad that I did). To me, Cheating Moth is Uno but (nearly) everyone is The Filch. This idea tickles me deeply, but I think I haven't found the right group to play with. I am a cheating fool (when specifically allowed by the rules), but the rounds I have played people seem very hesitant to cheat, so it ends up just being like Uno lol. I understand the hesitation, while I love to see what I can get away with in those bluffing situations, it does make my heart race, and not everyone is into that. I think I need to max out my player count with people in a goofy mood to really get the most out of this experience.|
|[Chinatown](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/47/chinatown)|I do love some good wheeling and dealing. The mix of negotiation, luck, extortion, and optimization makes Chinatown a hit for me and my group. It can be weakened by a spouse always giving their partner a good deal (I guess not every couple embraces the opportunity to crush the hopes and dreams of the one they love), but I've had fun every time. I even had fun with 8 players where we teamed couples up to make decisions together.|
|[No Mercy](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/339214/no-mercy) / HIT!|Push your luck in a deck of cards. I think this one is super simple, but I like that. There's not many decisions to make, a whole lot of luck, but it's speedy and swingy and that has its place in my heart. I want to get this played a bit more to really get a feel for it, but so far I am a fan.|
|[Art Robbery](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/341935/art-robbery)|I thought this was great at 2, my wife and I played it very rapidly and a bit petty as well. We played another time with some players who took their time to debate actions and weren't as aggressive at stealing from each other, and I think the game is improved by rapid and petty play. I want to explore this one more to see how that experience works with different groups / attitudes.|
|[Beneath the Med: Regia Marina at Sea 1940-1943](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/255456/beneath-med-regia-marina-sea-1940-1943)|My more serious solo game this year. A kind of simulation-ish submarine game that I found to be a surprisingly fun dice chucker. I've been sunk every time, but it's been fun, and I'm learning some strategy along the way. It takes a hot minute to set-up and play, but I expect I'll get a few more campaigns in next year.|
|[Cosmic Frog](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/295905/cosmic-frog)|This game I bought for the looks and the theme. The psychedelic frogs were so appealing, and the Cosmic Encounter type vibes called to me as well. We got a few plays of this in this year, and I had a great time. I think the team version was even better than the free-for-all because I didn't feel like I was picking on one person quite so much when I leapt across the Aether to punch a mountain out of their gullet and into mine.|
|[The Guild of Merchant Explorers](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/350933/guild-merchant-explorers)|I have mostly played this game solo, and man it is great. I've heard it described as a roll &amp; write without any rolling or writing, which I think is accurate and amusing. The exploration, upgrades, and sort of tides of progress and regression at the end of an age are delightful. I still need to explore the other maps, but I have been enjoying the first map so much I haven't bothered to explore any deeper (yet).|
|[Stay Cool](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/267475/stay-cool)|A stress simulator. This game is definitely not for everyone, in fact maybe not even for most people, but I do quite like the absurdity of the multi-tasking and the challenge of it all. I think with the right group this is a hoot, but if players are put off by the stress, it best to just chill on this one.|
|[Blitzkrieg!: World War Two in 20 Minutes](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/258210/blitzkrieg-world-war-two-20-minutes)|Another World War 2 game that I've been playing solo (that's 3 on this list I'm not realizing). This one I've been exploring the past couple weeks and I think it's pretty good. I think the AI is a little bit annoying to work through, but not terrible. We so often play games with either 2 (where we have so many good 2 player experiences) or 4+ that this game hasn't really had much of a chance this year. It's been nice to explore the decisions a bit recently.|
|[War of the Ring: Second Edition](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/115746/war-ring-second-edition)|A massive experience game that I've only played 3 times this year, but I played it 3 times this year, that's crazy! I'm a big fan of the the fiction in its various forms, and this is a lot of fun. Having now played as both the Shadow and the Free Peoples, I enjoyed both, but man the Shadow was more relaxed of an experience. Respawnable minions really takes the pressure off. There was always a bit of rules hunting and re-learning in each of the experiences, but considering the scope and scale, it's not surprising. I had a lovely time each time, and hope to dive in again next year. (Movie soundtracks as background music are a nice addition to this experience).|
|[TOKYO TSUKIJI MARKET](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/257198/tokyo-tsukiji-market)|I can't say why this game has grabbed me so much. Maybe it's the tiny little boats and fish counters, maybe it's the variety and mechanisms of the various fish markets, I'm not sure. Whatever the cause, this game stands out in my experiences this year for being a great puzzle to poke and prod.|
|[Irish Gauge](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/161882/irish-gauge)|Similarly, Irish Gauge was an experience I really liked. I think I like player-driven economies, making deals, jamming people up, and trying to make my own little efficient engine for points. Played this and Tokyo Tsukiji Market on the same day, and that day was a gaming highlight for this year.|
|[Crash Octopus](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/319579/crash-octopus)|As may be obvious by now, I quite like a dexterity game now and then. I only played this once, but it was a fun twist on dexterity and set collection. I'm still not sure if I want my own copy, but I'd gladly play it again for the goofy look, fun theme, chaos and strategy mix.|
|[Eclipse: Second Dawn for the Galaxy](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/246900/eclipse-second-dawn-galaxy)|Only played it once, it took like 7-ish hours, I got my butt kicked, but this was one of my top experiences of 2022. I like grand scope games (occasionally), and the combination of combat, upgrading, and economy management was a hit for me. I had to do a lot of rules and turn sequence management for my group, but I didn't mind a bit. I'm really looking forward to getting this played again and exploring the unique alien powers.|
|[Foundations of Rome](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/284189/foundations-rome)|Just one play of a buddy's copy for this one, but I was surprised by the fast and light-ish experience for such an absurdly large honker of a game. I expected to have to absorb a mountain of rules and mechanisms, but this was a surprisingly fun experience, and I hope to give it another go soon.|
|[Star Wars: X-Wing (Second Edition)](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/252328/star-wars-x-wing-second-edition)|This game may be more aspirational for me. I like the idea, but it also feels like a lot to explain. We got a play in, it was not balanced (a choice I made to keep complexity down), and I think that soured it a bit for my learning partners. I would like to explore this a bit more, because I had a great time chucking dice and blasting the Star Wars soundtracks.|

Instead, use dry erase marker. It colors just as well, but if it gets onto the plastic/vinyl sticker, it can be wiped off.

Additionally, it cleans up easier off the hands and comes in packs of 8 for $1 at the Dollar Tree.

" I wanted to do a write-up of all the games I tried at PAX Unplugged. for the first time. I played 17 games over three days, around the same number I did in 2019. This is the second time I was at PAX Unplugged.

This is the first time I went with a bigger group. We did an escape room, a puzzle box, and the Kickstarter scavenger hunt. It was a lot of fun, but it won’t count for this list. I also went pin hunting. I probably would have gotten more games in but around Saturday I was pushing myself too hard. 

I also saw demos for Fit to Print, Deep Dive, Hickory Dickory, Tinderbox, Scare in a Box, Call of the Wild, Great Rat Wars, Ahoy, Bloc by Bloc, Dead Reckoning, and Capital Punished. I won’t rank these since I didn’t get a full or partial play of them.

Anyway, here’s my quick first impressions (not reviews) of everything I played (that were new to me)! I’ll arrange this worst to best.

17. Vegetable Stock- A very bland game about playing cards with veggies on them to score points. It didn’t help that the other person playing with me and the teacher seemed really uninterested, and there’s nothing here in any category that made me interested.

16. Boop- A cute game where you’re trying to stack three big cats in a row while little and big cats can shove pieces around and off the board. It’s cute…but you can literally play the same game with coins and paper. A nice production hides what I think to be a shallow game.

15. Piazza Rabazza- Please look this up. You need to deliver magnetic pizzas while a crazy chef spins around in the middle of a cardboard town. It’s funny, but the windup chef in the middle feels brittle and it’s very hard to see where everyone is in the town. Points for uniqueness but not much else.

14. Catapult Feud- Great production of flinging plastic at each other like Angry Birds, but I wish there was more going on. Great table presence and fun for kids but that’s pretty much it. Maybe I could find a use for it, but it seems like you need an expansion or two to add variety, and that’s already a big ask.

13. Retrograde- A fun roll and write about destroying aliens like in Galaga and get more powers as you go. There are tons of ways to score points and dice rolling is fun. I liked some of the ideas in this game but I felt like it didn’t do enough to make it stand out from the rest of the genre. It still seems pretty okay, don’t get me wrong.

12. Heat Pedal to the Metal- I liked the art for this drag racing game a lot. The card manipulation is very fun and easy to understand, and I think this could work for different age groups. Boosts, heat, and changing gears is a lot of fun. Two things work against this. First, I’m not a big racing fan, and second, I felt like the game only got exciting in the last third of the game. There’s a lot of modules that I would try to see if it adds more to the equation I like, so I might be sleeping on this game somewhat.

11. Dice Theme Park- This was the worst teach. Our presenter was not comfortable teaching it and his accent made certain things harder to understand. I think I liked this game a lot, but it was more of a bad experience souring something that I think was actually not bad at all. Placing dice (customers) in your park is tactical because you want to keep them in your park scoring for as long as possible. The art was nice and I could see some early strategies open up. Sorry that a bad experience makes this hard to evaluate.

10. The Captain is Dead- Only this low because I played a lot of the Pandemic games already, and while I think this game is great, I don’t think I would personally have both series in my collection. Same idea of using your multiple actions each turn to fight off aliens, deal with threats to the ship, and create repairs everywhere. I would like to play Captain and Pandemic base to see which is better, because I think Captain might have the edge only because there’s a lot more going on. I still love Pandemic more, which is the only thing gatekeeping this gem. I also love the art.

9. Arboretum- Really need to play this again to get a better idea of this game about scoring lines of trees. Our play was fun, but it’s really easy on the first playthrough to accidentally cost yourself a lot of points by playing or discarding the wrong card. I have a feeling I’m underrating this game once you get in the groove. I love the art of the trees and the game teach is pretty good.

8. Take A Seat- Met with a random group of friends who invited me into this roll and write, and I really enjoyed it. You are trying to seat as many people in your theater by somewhat working with the player to your left and right. The rulebook was a bit bad, but I can see how it comes together and makes for a fun tetris like puzzle. Tons of ways to score but it is easy to play once you get the basic idea.

7. Quarto- I had a lot of fun playing this simple game that somehow eluded me all these years. I liked how easy it was to make a mistake or how you could force your opponent to give you the game. It was a fun game to play in a bar over a beer. It takes a lot for me to like an abstract but I really liked this one.

6. Sprawlopolis- cute little pocket card game about making a city and scoring or losing points based on different scoring conditions and number of roads. A lot of fun that can fit in your pocket and come with you anywhere. I really enjoyed trying to work out the best move. Is it something you play all the time? No, but it could come in handy when you’re on line or trying to kill a few minutes. Really liked it. 

5. Deal with the Devil- A medieval game about trading goods and making buildings to score points. Two players are human, one is a cultist, and one is the devil. You can trade away your own soul for resources but the evil players really want this to score massive amounts of points. The only two issues is that this game has to be exactly four players and I find it a tiny bit clunky. I really liked this game despite the two flaws, and I like how all the mechanics come together to make a unique experience.

4. Ankh: Gods of Egypt- I need to play this again, because I might be overrating this. I really liked how the action economy worked and how disposable each army feels. Losing all of your forces doesn’t seem too bad as long as you’re scoring a lot of points along the way. There’s some clunky parts like the god merging I would have liked to try, and it seems very YMMV, but I found playing a retail CMON weirdly refreshing without tons of plastic and extras overcomplicating everything. I’d want to retry this, play Blood rage for the first time, and replay my Rising Sun and see how they compare. The board and god minis were really nice too.

3. Catch the Moon- Did this kill Tokyo Highway for me? Maybe. This is a game about stacking wooden ladders on top of a plastic cloud. I really like how mistakes are less punishable and how easy the game is to teach. The game looks cheap to me but I think that actually works to its advantage. I lost really hard, but that didn’t matter because I was having too much fun watching our creation get more insane with every dice roll.

2. Lacrimosa- Amazing game about composing musical pieces, performing for money, and developing Mozart’s final piece. I made a massive mistake with scoring which ruined my score past the point of no return, but that’s okay. The board looks crazier than it really is and makes sense once the initial board layout shellshock wears off. I had a lot of fun scoring points, managing the tight economy, and using the card playing system. Great theme, great mechanics, and tough choices make this a massive hit.

1. Dice Throne- I loved this game. I like how every dice roll feels useful. I played as the Vampire Lord against the Artificer. I like how the characters seem very different from each other with lots of variable powers, great art, and unique dice. While expensive, it feels like it handles player counts very well and could be a great two player set or a massive collection. A lot of dice chucking fun that also plays quick.

Again, these are just off the cuff impressions and not reviews. Should I give any of these more repeatedly plays? Am I overrating or underrating anything? I also don't mind talking about any of the demos I saw but I can't give a lot of detail on those.",Pax Unplugged 2022 First Impressions: 17 Games Played!,1,self.boardgames,zehgy6,SaintMichael741,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/zehgy6/pax_unplugged_2022_first_impressions_17_games/,1670359307
"(bunchs of questions alarm,thanks for helping me!)

I was seriously confused when i saw a 3rd edition.I didnt knew it had that.I read on some other reddit post that its basically the same product but the 3rd one is kinda more simple or better designed.Is it the same game just with an different style or are these completly different stories and games?

can you play this game solo? i want too buy this for a birthday present for my cousin.but maybe its better with 2 people? or more annoying because one is smarter and one is dumber :D 

Also what version would you  recommend  me when i dont plan on buying tons of expansions? like of course i can afford some fun things sometimes but paying 60-70 for the core game and another 30-70 for expansions is too pricey for me.wish there would be game of the year editions like on video games :D 

should i go straight for the third version? but i heard the second version also does things well.Now i dont know anymore so i hope a arkham horror expert  can help me",What is the best entry to the Arkham Horror card game? and also do i need to buy the expansiosn too have fun? i dont have that much money lol,1,self.boardgames,zeh9v5,RushCute9448WiiTime,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/zeh9v5/what_is_the_best_entry_to_the_arkham_horror_card/,1670358872
"I’ve been working hard to keep my collection somewhat manageable. Part of that is having limited space to store my games (so that they don’t start sprawling all over the house, part of that is aggressively culling, and part of that is tracking plays. I’ve been tracking my played games since January of this year, and last Saturday I managed to replay all the games I own (including the ones I bought this year). Seeing that I’ve placed a purchasing embargo on myself after having splurged on games at Essen Spiel this year, I feel confident that this list reflects my taste in games at this point in time. Considering that I also like reading other people’s top games lists, I’m hoping people will find some value in mine :). But first, some housekeeping. 

**Method:**  
I used the ranking engine in Pubmeeple.com, always choosing the game that I am more excited to play next. In this scenario, I would choose between the perfect setting and playgroup for each game, with the idea that a fictional clone of me would participate in the other game (otherwise there would be no way I would choose a solo game over a game with multiple people, for example, because I prefer playing games with other people over playing games solo). I also only ranked games that I physically own in the state that I own them in, meaning that games with expansions also have their expansions included in the rating if I never play without it. Limiting myself to games I actually own was also done on purpose, with the idea being that a game can hardly be my favourite if I don’t care enough to own it. Do note though that I am the guy who has all the games in my gaming groups, which is why that system works. 

**Things of note:**  
All the games beneath, like, number 20 are all a bit looser in placement because of the method I’ve used to rank them. However, the top 20 has been pretty solid in ranking since the first pubmeeple ranking I’ve done, and all games in positions 21-40 have consistently shown up somewhere in that range. I’ve also played all the games here multiple times, making sure that I’ve got a proper feel for how they play – no games on here that I’ve only played once. The biggest omission from this list is Blood on the Clocktower, both because I don’t own it (my friend has the print and play copy we made) and because I’ve only played it once. I also realize that there’s a number of games on here that were released this year, and I wouldn’t be surprised if those games find themselves lower on the list in the future once the shine has worn off. Also, I do realize that there’s a lot of games from one particular designer in the top spots, but I do stand by those rankings. They’re absolutely some of the most exciting games I’ve played this year, and I’m chomping at the bit to break them out again. 

Lastly, and maybe most importantly, feel free to recommend games based on this list :). I’m always excited to broaden the horizon!

**Games that I'm surprised did not land in the top 40:**  
SHOBU, because I thought it would be my two-player abstract of choice; Fort, because it’s the game I would say is my favourite deck builderl; and Sea Salt &amp; Paper, because that tiny box has impressed the heck out of me since I bought it at Essen. 

Let’s get to it!  

-----

40: **Eldritch Horror (with all small box expansions)**  
Favourite player count: 4+  

Eldritch horror is an event game for my friends and I. Every year around december, I get a message from one or more of my friends asking me if we’re going to play Eldritch Horror again this year. It has been that way since I started college, and Eldritch Horror was actually the first hobby boardgame that I bought. We sit around the table, and we turn it into a whole-day affair. The last game we played lasted six hours when we won by the absolute skin of our teeth; we still sometimes talk about it. I own many games, and I’ve played many games, and I’ve even shared many games with my friends. And even then, only Eldritch Horror does this for my friends and I. It’s very special in that way, even if the corners start to fray and the bottom has started buckling due to the sheer amount of content I’ve insisted on stuffing in it. 

The other paragraphs will actually be about the game, I promise. 

39: **The Quest for El Dorado (with Dangers and Muisca expansion)**  
Favourite player count: 4  

The Quest for El Dorado feels great. The market feels good and fair, the race feels tense, but there’s still plenty of stuff that gets your butt out of your seat. The one rule that really makes this game to me is the fact that you can’t pass other players; it’s what turns this game from an interesting race to something that has people yelling and shouting and cheering out of their seats. It’s fast, it’s accessible and it gets the people going. Very much recommended, especially considering the large scope of playgroups that you can play this game with. 

38: **Scape Goat**  
Favourite player count: 4  

I’m not going to lie, this game is actually pretty divisive in my playgroups. There’s about a 75% chance that you will love this paranoia engine, and a 25% chance that you look at the cardplay and look at people moving tokens and you totally miss the shifty eyes and the point of the cards being played or being picked up or why someone looked in your hand or why Steve keeps naming a colour in passing and then suddenly it’s over and you should have gone to the police. It’s sad, but it keeps happening to some players. *But those other players though*. Scape Goat is unlike any other social deduction game because I feel so incredibly paranoid. I feel like I’m working together with people who keep having their guns trailed at me; I’m needing to plot with players in between breaths and winks and the snap of a card that does or doesn’t tell everything at once. You form play patterns in your head that you’re choosing to break but then don’t because *Brenda totally expects you to break from the patterns*. It is SO. GOOD. And I just wished that it was that good 100% of the time, because the one player that doesn’t get it, will never really get into it like people will during other games. If only they managed to see what I see.  

37: **Skull King**  
Favourite player count: 4  

I love Skull King just for how dumb it is. Skull King is a trick-taking hubris engine that can’t help but make me laugh. I’m terrible at it, too, having never ended with a score in the triple digits. But there’s just something really funny about winning a trick with the mermaid card right when the other person was trying to win with the Skull King. There’s something really funny about just tanking someone else’s bet when you’ve noticed that you can’t win yours, and I love the fact that this trick-taking game really is more than just “Wizard with some extra cards”. 

36: **Space Hulk (fourth edition)**  
Favourite player count: 2  

Space Hulk is not fair. Luckily for the players, the game never pretends to be fair. It is a game about survival against incredible odds with a group of woefully underequipped cannon fodder. It’s a game about knowing you will probably fail the task and doing it anyway because miracles exist. I personally love playing as the Genestealers, the relentless tide against the Space Marine’s noble hopes, as it feels great to create these tense puzzles for the other player to solve. And when you do survive as the Space Marines, you really do feel like you’ve accomplished something; you really do feel like you’ve done something momentous. 

35: **Architects of the Western Kingdom (with both expansions)**  
Favourite player count: any  

I don’t own many recipe fulfillment Euros, mostly because I like the way Architects does it best. Giving you a lot of workers instead of only a few feels fun, and I like the escalating resource acquisition and the game of chicken that you play with your opponent of when they will quote-unquote waste a turn capturing your men instead of working further towards their own goals. The player controlled game length also really helps to pressure those players who would rather sit and spin their little wheels to kingdom come (pardon the pun) instead of actually winning. It’s great, and has just enough interaction and milkshake drinking for little old me who loves kicking over other people’s sandcastles when he sees that he can’t win. The two expansions (Artisans and Works of Wonder) also add a lot to the game, and they’re great additions. Artisans adds another means of scoring points for those players who have bad luck getting their tempo going, and Works of Wonder has this great secondary game of chicken between getting benefits from contributing to a wonder and actually getting to build that wonder. It’s great. Great great great. 

34: **Cat in the Box**  
Favourite player count: 4  

I’ve had lots of fun playing Cat in the Box, although I do sometimes feel that Cat in the Box is more concerned with being clever than it is with being good. However, I then hear the vivid discussions between the other players about how they approached a hand and I look down at the score sheet and see how they have very similar scores, and it starts to dawn on me that Cat in the Box probably really is that good. It’s a trick-taking game where you get to choose the colour of your card as you play it, playing into a little area control game that’s happening as well. I’ve been having trouble actually winning this game, but the amount of conversation this little box has started really has me impressed. Plus, the new production by Bezier games is stellar. 

33: **Maskmen**  
Favourite player count: 3 or 4  

Another trick-taking game, and another game where the vague shadowy blobs that are the cards only get defined through play. Maskmen is a trick-taking game where none of the cards have numbers on them, instead allowing you to play out tricks and define the strength of the cards that way. I love Maskmen, mostly because it’s such a joy to make a small branching totem pole of luchador masks and because players have so much agency in shaping how the game progresses. Your hand is basically worthless when you get dealt it, and only becomes valuable through clever play. I love this game, even though it’s another one of these trick-taking games that I rarely win. It just feels great to see the game state blossom in your hand as you try and cleverly play your cards. 

32: **Whitehall Mystery**  
Favourite player count: 3  

This is currently my favourite hidden movement game. It’s the smaller, quicker sibling to Letters From Whitechapel, another game about murders committed by an unidentified serial killer in Victorian London that is inexplicably sold at literally every toy store here in the Netherlands. Whitehall Mystery is great, because both sides of the puzzle feel tense. Really tense. Chasing the killer is frustrating right until you find that lead and it turns out that they really did double back earlier even though you thought they wouldn’t be clever enough to do that. Being chased as the killer is a breeze right until you remember that the cops are rarely ever more than two steps away from you and they know exactly where you are at three distinct points in the game and they are *right behind you* for the rest of it. All that, in a game that lasts around 45 minutes. If you asked me, this should be the game that should be in toy stores. 

31: **Crash Octopus**  
Favourite player count: 4  

My love for this game is built out of two discreet parts. One: the components are beautiful and goofy. Two: flicking things at your boat in order to salvage them is difficult and stupid and I love it. And there really isn’t much more to it than that. Each turn is a 50/50 coin flip between doing something really cool, or hilariously failing. A key step of setup is dropping 90% of the components in the game onto an octopus’s head. Roughly every few turns, you’ll pause the game to watch people try and be good at bouncing a D6 off of an octopus’s head in order to ruin someone else’s day. It rarely works; it’s always funny. Crash Octopus is a work of mad genius and I will take no further questions about it. 

30: **Tribes of the Wind**  
Favourite player count: 3 or 4

I’m actually genuinely surprised that this game landed so high on this list, but Tribes of the Wind really does feel good to play. There is something very satisfying about building your little tile rows with little wooden kite men or tree houses or temples on them, and I like that a good part of the game is spent looking at what other people have. It’s a lovely game, lovingly produced and it has a good feel to it. That said, I’m unsure if this game will make it to next year’s list. We’ll see. 

29: **Tournament at Avalon (combined with Tournament at Camelot)**  
Favourite player count: 4  

I had this game pitched to me as “what if Cosmic Encounter is a trick-taking game?” and that description is just absolutely bang on. This game is dumb as hell, and I love it for it. The trick-taking process is not particularly exceptional, but the addition of asymmetric player powers and additional powers that players who are behind in points receive really makes this feel much more like “Mario Kart but it’s a dumb card game” rather than something that would take place at a smoky card table. Highly recommended if you want to have a good but dumb ol’ time. 

28: **Isle of Skye (with all bonus tiles)**  
Favourite player count: any  

I’ve pitched this game as “what if Carcassonne was fun?” to many people (and I stand by that decision), although I do feel that says much more about me than it does about Carcassonne. Isle of Skye is a lovely auction/tile laying game that, to my surprise, allows you to really crunch as deeply as you want to. To me, this game is a breezy and quick light little auctiony type deal, while some of my friends have nearly thought themselves into an aneurysm trying to get optimal tile placements and auction prices. I’ve loved how versatily the game really is. I’ve also got the Journeyman expansion, although I wouldn’t recommend playing with that as a default. Great game though, can’t wait to get it to the table again. 

27: **The King is Dead (second edition)**  
Favourite player count: 1-3

My absolute favourite part of this game is starting the rules explanation with “I have good news, the king is dead” before everyone else at the table responds with “HOORAY!”, mostly because it allows us a moment of togetherness before this game kills that feeling forever. The King is Dead is superb. It’s a game in which you only get to do eight things, but where doing nothing is about half the game and is *nerve wracking*. The shifting allegiances are almost something akin to what you would find in something like Pax Pamir, if you were to be reductive about that sort of thing. The symmetrical hand of action cards is also tremendous, mostly because it removes any shield for players to feel like they were being ambushed – you knew they might play a reorganization card because it has been staring you in the face for the entirety of the game. 

My only real complaint is that I’ve now played this game so often (and with so many different groups) that it’s starting to develop a kind of Smash Brothers problem; I’ve grown to be really very good at this game, and playing it with new players starts to feel more and more like I’m smurfing them. Hopefully I’ll find a group of people who are willing to play this game over and over and over again. 

26: **Flamme Rouge (with Peleton and Meteo expansion)**  
Favourite player count: 3 or 4

Of the two racing games on my list, this is by far my favourite. Flamme Rouge is filled with so many chances for players to be clever, to be bold, and to be absolutely hosed by their own hubris. I’ve now played this game so many times and I still see players do things I’ve not really seen before. And man, do I get reminded every game that this is a game of *inches*. I’ve lost multiple games by one or two spaces – spaces I had lost earlier in the game because I bumped into people and lost some amount of distance. Flamme Rouge is really, really good. And, fortunately, it is only made better by it’s two expansions! Love this game – actually played it last weekend. 

25: **Bear Raid**  
Favourite player count: 4

I’ve thought so much about this game since the last time I played it. A lot of it comes down to hubris – you may see a pattern in the games I like. I love the fact that this is a stock market game where there’s a lot of fuzz and where things are hidden, meaning that you just get to make bold plays and don’t really find out if they’re successful until you lift the screens and find out that the player who you thought was ahead 15 stocks was actually absolutely blown out by a stock split earlier in the game and is now 20 stocks in debt. Bear Raid is funny, whimsical and only a little bit tedious. I’ve been meaning to get this game to the table again – if only the theme was, like, 20% more accessible. 

24: **Camel Up (second edition)**  
Favourite player count: 4+

We’ve developed a few traditions when we play Camel Up. First, we play the Mario Kart 8 desert theme on loop. Second, I get all participants who would like to partake in an alcoholic beverage one of their choosing (and those who abstain whichever drink they do prefer). Third, I open the game by blindly bidding on the winner of the whole race based on basically nothing – I get rewarded for it more often than not. It’s that kind of game – it’s a game that could almost be played without hands. 

Camel Up is a lovely, rauckus game. It’s just rolling dice and watching little bakelite camels run around a track, but man do people get out of their seats for the dumb things. They stand up, they scream, money gets thrown on the table, long shots are taken (and mostly missed), and we end up with a game that almost always feels too short – the good kind of too short. The game welcomes people into its day-at-the-races mirage, where you push imaginary pounds towards a personified stack of technicolour bakelite camels. I can’t believe I almost sold this game last year. 

23: **Pagan: Fate of Roanoke (with all expansions)**  
Favourite player count: 2

Pagan pulls off a trick that I’ve seen very few games pull off well – it is a game that a) does asymmetric deck building compellingly enough that I would say it rivals Netrunner and b) manages to make a two-player social deduction game be breathtaking and *tense*. I’ve kind of fallen in love with this game, and I’ve barely even touched the deck building. It really does do a kind of bizarre magic trick where you really do feel like you’re playing some grand social deduction game while also playing “ice” and doing “runs” like you would in Netrunner. If only this game played more than two people, then I could actually get it to the table. 

22: **Quacks of Quedlingburg (with The Herb Witches expansion)**  
Favourite player count: any

I don’t feel like I have a lot to say about Quacks that hasn’t been said more eloquently by other people, so all I will say is that it’s the rare game that my SO keeps asking to play again and again, while also being something that I also want to play again and again. That, by itself, is a feat worth cherishing. 

21: **Long Shot: The Dice Game (with Kickstarter promos)**  
Favourite player count: any

This is the other betting game on my list. Although many people (fairly, I might add) compared this game to Camel Up when it came out, there really is a world of difference between them. Long Shot is much more cerebral and gives the players much more agency, while also creating many more opportunities for you to just absolutely goozle yourself. I’ve seldom had games of Camel Up where people straight up have no money left, while in Long Shot that mostly happens on turn two. I love the fact that players get into a kind of group think about which horse should win the race after first spending half the game ousting it because player 3 bought it on their turn and now it sucks because they own it and you don’t. There’s a degree of pettiness and match fixing and collusion that I think most betting games miss, mostly because it’s hilarious. Plus, watching those big chunky horse boys go round the track is immensely satisfying. 

And don’t even get me started on how buying hot dogs lets you alter time and space. It’s the only way that going to a consession stand somehow manages to shunt horses backwards. It’s dumb and it’s great and I love it. 

20: **Golem**  
Favourite player count: 2 or 3

Golem would be much, much higher on my list if only it was easier to parse (and therefor easier to teach). The core conceit of building up these spaces on your board so that your actions kind of snowball the more you’ve progressed in the game is great, and the four round game mercifully keeps it from just going on forever. Plus, despite having a board that is kind of bland-looking, I can’t help but love the way those chunky golem boys run across the board in search for jobs to do. Great fun that has iconized itself into a place where it is too unwieldy to share. 

19: **Decrypto**  
Favourite player count: 4+, in even numbered groups
I’m going to take the uncontroversial position that Decrypto is great. One position that IS controversial though, is that I like it much more than most other word games. I like it more than Codenames, Just One, So Clover, pretty much anything, and that is because you actually get to do something while the other team is playing. You get to be clever while the other people are being clever, and when they try to be cleverer you get to be even more clevererer. The problematic teach (which basically amounts to “we’ll just play round one and I’ll walk you through it”) really is exaggerated, but the problem does exist. However, that has not stopped me from playing this with as many different groups as possible. And let me tell you – it has always been a hit. 

18: **Joraku**  
Favourite player count: 3

This was a surprising success to me. I bought Joraku at the last Essen Spiel from a very kind gentleman who was very patient in explaining to me how the game worked. When we got back to our AirBnB that night, it was the first of my games that we played together and I had such a fantastic time. Joraku combines a lot of stuff I like (tight trick taking, shifting values, area control, direct interaction) in a beautiful package that is no larger than it really needs to be. I’m hoping other people start picking this game up as well, because I really do think that there’s something special here. 

17 **Agricola**  
Favourite player count: 2

I’m going to be straight-up with you kind people – I don’t understand why people say that four players is the best player count for Agricola. I played it at four players once and I absolutely hated it. At two though, Agricola is much more my speed. I get to have more of the bucholic farm experience that I want while still occasionally driving a dumptruck straight through all of my opponent’s best-laid plans. It’s flexible like that, Agricola; one half farmland fantasy, one half dream wrecker. 

16: **Ra**  
Favourite player count: 4

I’ve mostly played Ra together with a specific subsect of my friend group, and Ra has started to kind of take on a life of its own with these people. And I get why, because Ra is fantastic. Beneath its aggressively beige exterior lies so many *moments*. Grabbing a tile out the bag is exciting, calling “RA!” while grabbing a chunky wooden totem is exciting, discussing the merits of bidding 5 rather than 6 is hilarious, and I do feel that Ra (even though there’s a good smattering of luck) really does reward good play. There’s a necessity for players to be bold while they try to feel out its strange rhythm, and there’s most definitely a specific flow to the game. I’m eagerly awaiting the new version by 25th Century Games so that I can start playing it with people without first having to write a letter of apology to their entire family for having the audacity to bring out a game that looks about as appealing as a clump of dirt. Ra is fantastic; it’s worth looking deeper than its crusty exterior. 

15: **Tichu**  
Favourite player count: 4

We’ve reached the highest placed trick-taking game on my list, and its one where semantic pedants could have a real case saying that it’s not a proper trick-taking game. Can’t wait to get smacked down with that. 

Playing Tichu is electric though – it really is something else. There’s a lot happening in a game of Tichu, and much like games like Klaverjassen, the fact it’s played in teams entirely changes the dynamic compared to other games on this list. I’ve had so many plays of this game where I played a card and immediately regretted it, only to be saved by my partner. I’ve had players be incredibly clever by doing plays I had not even thought possible. And then there’s calling Tichu; the to be or not to be. Whether ‘tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, or, to rise up against a sea of haters and, by declaring Grand Tichu even though you’re not 100% sure, end them. I’ve only played one game of Tichu this year and I’ve spend months thinking about this game ever since. It really is electric. 

14: **Spirit Island (with everything that's currently out)**  
Favourite player count: solo

I’ve taken up solo gaming mostly as a kind of mindful activity away from my computer screen and smart phone, and Spirit Island has been really good for that. Taking on this persona of the air that rushes between the leaves in the trees or the collected hive mind that inexplicably exists between birds has been a breath of fresh air. Spirit Island is an exercise is simply being really really good. The production is spot on, the gameplay feels refreshing and varied and novel every time I play, and it is one of the few games that manages to get me to sit and ponder moves for a few minutes. I sit, and I plod, and I shift tokens around until I’m sure. And then I resolve, the Rube Goldberg machine unfolds, and I move on to the next turn where I will shift like the currents underneath a ship, and I will drag your loved ones and their offspring straight to Hades. It really is something special. 

13: **Sodalis**  
Favourite player count: 4 or 6

I’m sad to keep bringing up this game because it is hard for other people to get a hold of this, but Sodalis really is fantastic. I’m not that much of a team player (even though this game, Tichu and Decrypto are this high up in my rankings), but I love working together in Sodalis. Part of that is the fact that all information is open, meaning you don’t have to dance around hidden information that isn’t public but needs to be to actually plan and strategize, and part of that is the fact that you get to pull together cool combos together with your team mate. I think this has been the most disappointing game I’ve introduced to people, stemming exclusively from the fact that I can’t point my friends to a website where they can easily get it. If I could, I bet this game would be literally everywhere. It really is that good. 

12: **Troyes (with Ladies of Troyes expansion)**  
Favourite player count: 4

I have to thank Kellen of Board Game Barrage for intriducing this game to be, because it is fantastic. Although I tend to like Eurogames well enough, one of my main peeves is that most modern Euros tend to have people barely interacting until one of the players ran their engine the bestest and we all get to go home. Not so in Troyes, where having a good engine means you’re going to get interacted with the most. It brings an almost wargame-like sensibility to a genre normally filled with siloed playspaces and a Rube Goldbergian design ethos. It feels refreshing to look other players in the eye and say that yes, you are playing this game with them, and, yes, you will pay them some deniers to take their best die out of their hands because you have an archer to put to work. It’s hilarious, and it’s great. Plus, you get to quote the flavour text for the Magic the Gathering card Reparations about fifty times per game, which is like 90% of a good reason to play this game if you ask me. 

11: **Wonderland's War**  
Favourite player count: 3 or 4

I wish this game was easier to teach, set up and was quicker to play, as that would probably catapult this game even higher on my list. And despite that, despite all that, I still found myself selling Blood Rage because I just wanted to play this game instead each and every time. It’s rare to find a game that’s both overtly maximalist while having no real fat to trim. It feels like there’s one or two mechanics too many while simultaneously feeling like there’s nothing you can get rid of. And, truth be told, the bag building feels kind of silly. But then you start actually pulling chits from the bag and blasting your opponents in the face with seven flamingoes and all that goes out the window. It’s a maximalist riot, and I’m glad to have it. 

10: **Shadows Over Camelot**  
Favourite player count: 4+

I had first played Shadows Over Camelot about ten years ago, back when I wasn’t really that much into board games. I had played Werewolf before, so I had some understanding of what a social deduction game was, but I didn’t fully know what I was getting into. At the end of that, I had to seriously question how good one of my friends was at just straight up lying to me for an entire game, before revealing themselves and turning our narrow win into a crushing defeat. I’ve since sought out this game and have played it a bunch of times. There’s nothing else really on the market like Shadows Over Camelot. I’ve not since seen a mix of cooperative play together with a hidden traitor mechanic, especially because Shadows Over Camelot spices it up by *not always having a traitor in there*. Games where there isn’t a traitor are especially good as you suddenly turn into Shadows Over Salem with all players accusing the others of being traitors while only ever stabbing at illusory motives. I love this game to pieces, and I’m hoping it’ll get reprinted sooner than later. It has really aged like a fine wine. 

9: **Pax Pamir (second edition)**  
Favourite player count: any  

Pax Pamir does something remarkable, and I’m having a hard time really putting my finger on what it is. It LOOKS good, that’s a good place to start, but I’ve gotten rid of tons of games that only ever look good. It’s also really difficult to play well, even after you’ve managed to feel confident enough in the rules to start playing. And then you get to playing, and you feel kind of lost, so then you turn to the cards and suddenly three hours have passed and you’re disassembling this beautiful landscape that you have built along with these cards that bleed history whenever you flip a new one. Pax Pamir , then, must get its remarkability from the alchemy that happens somewhere between the players when they start playing cards and moving discs and playing tribes and moving spies before you pay Mohammad Shah to assassinate a group of Barakzai traders which shifts your loyalty and unlocks Kandahar for conquest and then suddenly three hours have passed and its time to go back to reality. It really, well and truly is something remarkable. 

8: **Tigris and Euphrates**  
Favourite player count: 4

The game lovingly described as “Tigers and Pots” by the kind crew over at Shut Up and Sit Down was one of those games that allowed me to level up. Not necessarily as a player, although I do occcasionally manage to win games of Tigers and Pots if the holy spirit really catches me, but much more so as a person who teacher other people how to play his games. When I bought it online, I first spent two weeks thinking about how I would begin teaching the game. I lost sleep over thinking of how I would approach internal and external conflicts, of how I would be talking about shared infrastructure, of how I would take people along on this ride of differing player symbols but not colours, and it helped me develop a mindset where I could start breaking games down in my head and then explain them to others in a way that makes it sound easy, manageable; doable even. Occasionally, on a good day, I would even make it sound easy. And then we get to sit down and play one of the most unconventional games in the hobby, and each and every time I get reminded just how bloody smart some other people are for managing to come up with stuff like this. 

7: **Hansa Teutonica: Big Box**  
Favourite player count: 4

I occasionally organize game days together with friends, and these days have lovingly been dubbed Beigefests because I tend to break out the beigest, Euroiest, dryest games that I want to inflict onto others. Hansa Teutonica was one of the four founding fathers, and has remained to be a perennial classic at my kitchen table. It sits on my shelf, knowing that every time I do manage to convince a group of people to play its game of cube placing and route building with me, that those people will leave the table saying “dang that’s a good game”. Because that is what has happened every time I’ve played it. The Big Box is an absolute blessing by the way; not because I’m afraid that I will ever truly tire of the regular board or will feel that I need any of its expansion material, but it feels good knowing that it is there nonetheless. 

6: **Root (with all expansions)**  
Favourite player count: 4

I’ve taught Root to about eight or nine different groups of people now, and I’ve gotten so good at it that I’ve been losing every time I play a new group. I adore Root for the fact that the game has now gotten so large, specialized and so comfortable with being exactly what it is, that I can now tailor a game exactly to the kind of group I have sitting around my table. It’s flexible and beautiful and much like water in that it can now fit in pretty much any vessel that I pour it into. Does it take some shepparding? It does, especially at the start. But then you get to release the hounds fully and bask in the glory of them while being torn to shreds. And next time, I’ll bring it over to a completely different group and pour this game into an entirely different vessel and watch it comfortably sit and fill whatever nooks need filling. Love this game – it’s probably the game I’ve played the most since I got it for my birthday two years ago. 

5: **Pax Renaissance (second edition)**  
Favourite player count: 2  

If there is ever a time where I would have to choose between this game and Pax Pamir, I would choose Pax Renaissance. Pax Renaissance is sufficiently different from – and even more esotheric than – Pamir, but I love how the game feels kinder in a strange way. Here you also collaboratively build up these empires on the board in front of you, or have agents stalk the cards that live in other player’s tableaus, but there’s also a much more dynamic end game condition and a tableau of cards that lets you do more of the cool thing that you want to do, which is activating your cards. Now, I will say that this game is even more of a bear to teach than Pamir due to the fact that it is filled to the brim with unnecessary jargon, but once you bite down into the meat of the game you’ll find that it really is electric.  

4: **John Company (second edition)**  
Favourite player count: 4

What can I say, really. There’s nothing in my collection that comes close to doing anything that John Company does, and apparently it really does feel good to be evil. 

John Company, for being a game about controlling one of the most unequivocal forces of evil in human history, understands that there’s import to making you relish in being that evil. There’s something unmistakeably pithy about haggling for single pounds before sending all your military might to Hydrabad and crushing it beneath your jackbooted heel. You get sucked into its illusion before being violently ejected outwards at the end, being forced to reckon with what that tiny metal flag represented. Like I said above – there’s really nothing like it. 

3: **The Estates**  
Favourite player count: 4  

On the topic of being an absolute bastard. 

The Estates is, simply put, one of the meanest games I own and I relish every play I’ve had of this game. I don’t get to play it often, usually only once or twice a year, but every time I play The Estates I spend a significant amount of time absolutely laughing myself in twain. There’s just something unreasonably funny about seeing someone place a small wooden block on top of another player’s wooden block and then turning to that player when they swear that they will end you. There’s just nothing better than that. Plus, let’s face it – it really does feel good to be bad sometimes. 

2: **Oath: Chronicles of Empire and Exile**  
Favourite player count: 4

I was given Oath as a birthday present by a group of close friends last year. After having opened it and having set up the game again and again (before putting it away again), I told three of these friends (who had expressed wanting to play it with me) that in a perfect world, we would play this game five times this calender year. In two weeks, on my birthday, these friends are coming over to play our fifth game of Oath. We’ve now internalized the rules to such a degree that I don’t need to go over them again when we play a new game. We’ve all been Chancellor, citizens and exiles, and we’ve seen all the ways a game can end. We’ve each grown fond of specific cards that have started gaining reputations of their own (in our game that’s the Alchemist card) and all live in fear of what the conspiracy vision might wreak on all of us. Each game has felt different and live, but most of all dynamic; I’ve found our fingerprints on different corners of the game. The slow-changing legacesque mechanics in this game help you to slowly but surely shape the world into something that resembles your group, while never obligating you to destroy what came before. I look forward to playing that fifth game and seeing what that next chapter of the story of this world is going to be. 

1: **Mage Knight: Ultimate Edition**  
Favourite player count: solo

There was never really a question of this being number one for me. Mage Knight has been my favourite game for a number of years now, even though it’s so big and cumbersome that I don’t really get it to the table that often. The reason it’s my favourite after having played it 15 times and having only won once, is because everything I do in this game feels rewarding, intriguing and *hard*. I’ve had multiple plays of this game where I will just set it up, draw my cards and then just stare at the board for fifteen minutes trying to figure out what the hell I should do next. And there’s SO MUCH that I still haven’t seen or touched left in the box, even after all those plays. And, this part is key, I’ve also consistently felt like I’ve been actually getting better. This game really is about failing upwards.

"Hello boardgamers!

I have decided to start a yearly thing (hopefully) of me growing my collection and finding myself having played more and more games each year. I really began to dig deep into boardgaming in late 2018, early 2019 and I've come to play a lot of recent games. I had some amount of experience with older games, but for the longest time I was more into MTG and video games than boardgames.

**Method**

I used PubMeeple to import my BGG collection. I use the BG Stats app to track all my plays so it was easy enough for me to make sure my collection was up to date for this exercise. I ranked the 77 base games I own and a dozen more games I do not on, but played many times over the years.

I took out games where I had a played only a single time because I didn't it was fair to those game to be compared with games I played 20+ times. I also took out expansions and rated the games solely based on the core game, without any expansions. That definitely changed some ratings that I will explain later.

**Runner ups**

26 - **7 Wonders Duel**

This is one of the games that expansions would change the ranking for this game. I rate the Pantheon expansion higher than the base game, but rate Agora an abysmal 4.0/10. This game is THE game that hooked me up to modern boardgaming. So many fun memories learning it with my partner and having her learn the boardgaming world I was missing. It's a fun game overall, but I agree that it should not be in my top 25. 

27 - **Piraten kapern**

This is the ultimate filler game. I shouldn't like this one so much, but it's so fast, can explained to literally anybody and is one of the only ""push your luck"" game that I truly enjoy.

28 - **Raiders of Scythia**

My least favorite Garphill Games that I played and it is still ranking 28th in my all time games. That just shows you how much I enjoy their games.

29 - **Machi Koro 2*

Fun quirky games where you turn your brain off and try to roll better than your opponents. 29th is probably too high for me, but I'll follow what my heart told me.

30 - **Cartographers w/Heroes (counted as a single game)**

One of the few that I actually play and own both, but put into the same game since they are basically the same game. 30th is perfect.

**25-11**

Now for the reason you all have clicked (or maybe not) on this thread. My top 25 games of all time.

25 - **Cryptid**

This game is the only deduction game I actually enjoyed. I usually am not a fan of this type of genre because it puts either team vs team or 1 vs all, but this one is purely your own deduction style, with a fun enough puzzle that doesn't take too long to figure out. While yes it can suffer from user errors, I still haven't had anybody misinterpret a clue, so maybe my rating would change according to that?

24 - **Mechs vs. Minions**

I fully suspect this will fall off the top 25 next year simply due to the fact that I will probably never play it again and that I will buy more and more games. For now, it still has its place here, being my favorite Legacy game of all time. The production is also absolutely incredible!

23 - **That's Pretty Clever!**

My favorite of the three ""Clever"" games I own (soon the 4th is probably coming in the Americas). It's fast, it's simple and the replayability is almost endless. A perfect game for the often short amount of time we can find to play.

22 - **The Quacks of Quedlinburg**

This is another game where expansions would wildly affect the rating. I do not believe the base game will hold in the top 25 for long, but if paired with both expansions, it probably would. I enjoy Quacks, but often find myself wanting to play it once or twice in a short period and never even think about it for months on end. hen it gets to the table, it's always a good time and I almost always win due to my incredible luck.

21 - **Wingspan**

Base Wingspan is this low, First expansion would put it in my top 15, second expansion would drop it below top 30 probably. I rated it solely on base game without any house rules (we do play with multiple house rules). It's a fun game but it's not deserving of a higher rating than this with the base game only.

20 - **Paladins of the West Kingdom**

I suspect this is only 20th because it had to compare to other amazing games I own and play more often. This game is by far my favorite of the West Kingdom series. The only problem is that I find the replayability kind of lacking. There are not that many efficent paths to victory sadly. I still very much enjoy it and will never turn it down, but I don't see it getting higher than this in the future.

19 - **Caper: Europe**

I am very surprised this made the top 25 honestly. I do not enjoy it that much. It's a fun enough game, but I just don't itch to play it. I suspect that it will not stay in the top 25 next year.

18 - **Hadrian's Wall**

Heavy flip-n-write game is not something I thought I would enjoy but this game is only 18th because of how long it is. There is only a very very minimal amount of interaction between players and sadly you can't just play complete solitaire even at 2 players because if a player decides to give your a ressource on their 17th turn of the round, it might change your path. I truly enjoy it and will continue to explore the multitude of avenues you can take to reach the endgoal.

17 - **Terraforming Mars: Ares Expedition**

Oh how the mighty have fallen. This used to be in my top 5 games. We played it maybe too much, but it is dropping at every subsequent play for the both of us. I suspect that without the upcoming expansions this will fall below 25 next year.

16 - **Clank!: A Deck-Building Adventure**

I was happily surprised at how well this game is holding up with the years. This one was the first game that made me realise boardgames and TCGs could be played alongside. I was able to use all my experience from MTG to try and build the most efficient engine I could. It still holds up to this day and we dust off this bad boy from time to time when we want to walk along memory lane.

15 - **Resurgence**

A new entry in my collection and a very well appreciated one. I suspect this might suffer from a recency bias, but for what the game has to offer, I think 15th is currently just right for it. It really deliver it's promise of being an entry-to-medium eight woker placement game that plays in an hour flat. Only time will tell where this will end up, but I suspect it will hold it's top 25 for at least 1 or 2 years.

14 - **Verdant**

Another very recent addition to our collection. I thinkthe decision tree gets too narrow the more the game goes on, but I think the opening 10 moves you make are the most enjoyable out of the 3 games in the ""series"" (Calico, Cascadia, Verdant). We seem to enjoy more and more those type of games and this one will hold it's place for a very long time I think.

13 - **The Isle of Cats**

With the expansions, this would definitely be in my top 10, but it just missed the mark without. I do not always like ""pure"" polyomino"" games, but this one I do. 

12 - **Lost Ruins of Arnak**

I think this one definitely should be lower without the expansions. Without Leaders, I think this would not make the top 25 at all. I decided that this would be the only game that would be bundled with the expansion because I simply think it was a big mistake to sell the base game without asymetry. Don't @ me for this choice, I do what I want!

11 - **Everdell**

This one is hard to rate without any expansion, but I think 11th is where I would put it if I made the list myself. We prefer playing it with either the 2-deck variant or with an expansion, but Base game is very well enjoyable anyway. 


**Top 10**

Now we get to the best of the best. Those are all games I would rate 9.0/10 and higher. 

10 - **Circadians: First Light**

This is by far the best example of how you do luck mitigation in a dice placement game. The game itself doesn't reward you for rolling all 6s but instead forces you to adapt to what you roll and which dice you want to have control over. This is my favorite Garphill Games and I do not see it change anytime soon.

9 - **Kanban EV**

My first Lacerda game! This is one of the game I was never letting myself buy because of how scary it looked. To my incredible surprise, it is not that complex gameplay wise, but the decision tree it offers is gigantic. I can only see this one rise up in the ranks or at the very least hold it's 9th place.

8 - **Cascadia**

I'm surprised this made the top 10, but it's my favorite of those 3 games I talked earlier. I think the overall game play is less interesting than the opening moves in Verdant, but the arc is way better and the game plays smoother. I do believe this might still be in the top 10 next year, but it willdpends if it becomes stale after our 50th play.

7 - **PARKS**

This was my number 3 last year. I think this game suffers from being kind of too long compared to other lighter games. Expansions helped a bit in the replayability and overall decision tree, but added another layer of complexity to an alreadyquite long game. I don't see it fall off the top 10 next year, but honestly, I wouldn,t be surprised to see it 11th.

6 - **The Crew: Mission Deep Sea**

My favorite trick taking game and the one I know a lot of people also hold in high esteem. This has been my go-to game with 4 players and the gmae I always bring to family gatherings. It's a game where we say ""just a couple rounds"" and we'll end up playing until midnight. I do not see this one fall off at all. It's just that good.

5 - **Sleeping Gods**

Ranked 2nd overall last year, I do believe this will creep back up by default when the second one gets to my doorstep, but for now, it still has its place in my top 5. Everything from the storytelling, the gameplay and the art is wonderful and it made me discover one hell of a prolific duo in the Laukat family. 

4 - **Carnegie**

This one crept from nowhere into my top 5. I bought it based on some vague recommendation and promises that it would be the best kept secret of 2022. Oh how good is this game! I think it has slight balancing issues, but the way the action seletion works and how important it is to keep track of other players options just make me want to play more every time we get it to the table. I suspect this will be in my top 5 for years to come.

3 - **Ark Nova**

This is tough. It was my number 1 last year but playafter play, I become less interested in it. I tried almost every possible obvious pathways and tried so many different strategies on almost every map and I might have exhausted my enjoyment of it. It might be different when the expansion coms around, but it won't change how I feel about the base game, since expansions do not count.

2 - **Dune: Imperium**

This is a game I can see being 2nd and 5th at the same time. As much as I enjoy it, I always kind of doubt myself wanting to play it because of how long a game can be. Nevertheless, it is a masterpiece in simplicity, but the decisions you have to make all throughout the game just me happy. Base game can't be 1st, but I think with all 3 expansions, I would put it above my next and final entry.

1 - **Bitoku**

This game made the biggest splash this year. It began as a ""wow, this game is good, but I don't think 2 players is the correct player count"" to a ""wow, this game is my favorite game of all time when played at 3 players"". I cannot recommend this one enough. It has insane replayability, requires you to always prepare for the next season before playing your first die in the current season and the aths to victory are endless. Every time we play this, I discover a new fun way to go about the game. You have variable player interaction in that you cna try and outwit your opponent in making a seemingly good move for them only for them to realise you didn't care about crossing the river and you prefered keeping your 6 for the next round.

Overall this is not a game I ever see dropping from the top 3, at least not in the near future. It has everything I enjoy in games.


**Notable absents**

**Twice as Clever and Clever Cubed** : respectively 31st and 36th, those games just don,t hold as well as the original one.

**Robinson Crusoe** : It's a game that I would put into the top 25 solely based on gameplay, but the game has way too many corner cases and wierd interactions. It also takes way too long. This year, it got to 32nd

**Gloomhaven : Jaws of the Lion** : I blieve this game was in my top 10 last year, but we simply do not enjoy it anymore. It is repetitive, repetitive and repeats itself over and over and over again, scenario after scenario. First 10 were fine, but after a while, it just becomes a mash-em-up kinda game without real meat behind. Fell down all the wa to 34th and will probably keep going down

**Popular games I own that I do not enjoy**

**Marvel Dice Throne** : I simply do not enjoy the entire Dice Throne stuff. I fnd it extremely luck-based and there's almost zero meaningful interaction. ""Do you have it?"" ""Yes!"" ""Ok I lost"". That's not fun gameplay to me. down in the 50th place, right next to Dice Throne Season 1.

**Meadow** This game went all the way to 47th. I just do not fell like there's much game behind the wonderful art. I feel like it,s a watered down version of many other games I own and enjoy and I don't ever ask my partner to play it. 

**Lords of Waterdeep** : Not that I dislike it, but it just became too ""simple"" for me if that's the correct phrasing. I enjoy it, but I never seek it out anymore. Down to 53rd. It should probably be higher, but I do not particularily care about it either.

**Pandemic** I do not enjoy coop games for the most part and Pandemic never bring me joy. 55th.

**Radlands** I hate that stupid game. Period. 58th

**Century : Spice Road**, **Splendor**  : Respectively 63rd and 70th. Even as a beginner, I never enjoyed those games. In fact, those games are what made me hesitant to play boardgames because I thought if all the boardgames people will make me play are as bad as those 2, I will never like it.

**Ticket to Ride : Europe (or any other TTR game)** : It's not for me. 69th.

**The bottom of the bottom**

You might be wandering my bottom 5? Maybe not, but I'll give it to you anyway.

73 - **Control** : What an absurdly broken card game. It is a good loking one but the designer forgot to balance it completely. The entire game will revolve around who draws more of the counter spell cards. How stupid is that.

74 - **Istanbul** : What a terrible game. I have hated every single play of it. Never again.

75 - **Escape from the aliens in Outer Space : the single worst hidden movement game I have ever played. It's almost impossible for the aliens to do anything. The more people at the table, the more impossible it is to do anything. Best way to win is to rush an exit and camp around it until someone comes for it and gets caught. What a stupid game.

76 - **Ghooost!** : My vote for the worst Richard Garfield game of all time. There's nothing interesting in it.

77 - **Blokus** : I sincerely do not understand how this is dead last. I enjoy it more than those 4 previous games. It's still not a very fun game, but it's not 77th worth. 

**Upcoming entries**

Next year, I suspect those games will put up a good fight to get into my top 25 :

- **Wayfarers of South Tigris**
- **Earth**
- **Unconscious Mind**
- **Pampero**
- **Weather Machine**
- **Revive**
- **Sabika**
- **Clever 4 Ever**
- **Leaf**

"So I'm starting to build my own collection of board games. I have fairly decent experience with some more challenging titles, however, my target group is more on the light side when it comes to games. So far, I have successfully hosted a few 7 Wonders and Catan games and I intend to gradually take it higher in terms of complexity. Mind you, these are still very much the ""I play board games, I like Monopoly"" types of players.

So far, my collection consists of:
Terraforming Mars (tried already with some and really liked it)
Dune: Imperium (next in line to try, will be challenging)
Detective (falls out mi-playthrough)
Catan (not really done it for us)
7 Wonders (started with it and it instantly clicked)
Dead of Winter (they didn't like it)

I'd like to keep the play options diverse, so I want my future games to be each about something else. The problem is, I am not based in US and have limited options when it comes to less popular titles. Looking at my games and what was liked so far I was looking forward to buying:
- another light game (cannot decide between one of the Azuls, Cascadia or Calico);
- a more strategic approach to building/collecting (maybe Everdell, Arnak or Viticulture);
- a typical party game for more people (here it's pretty broad, but we also like a little bit of mean fun so anything with asshole moves and elimination is welcome)
- an introduction to area control (Scythe will be too heavy, but maybe Blood Rage or Pax Pamir?)

"Still building my board game collection sometimes while not yet having a solid gaming group in my location. Thus it can be hard to justify splurging on big games that I don't really get to play. That said, I backed both Cerebria and Trickerion from Mindclash through Kickstarter and really like both of them, hope to at least play solo more often sometimes. 

So now I was looking at Astra (inexpensive, readily available) but just noticed Septima (too late for the KS, of course).

A little background: I started with dominion as my first physical deckbuilding game, (Slay the Spire being my first ever deckbuilder). I've played others like: The Black Book, Inscryption, and Clank! However, I want to upgrade to a meatier 1 vs 1 experience. 

I've been doing a lot of deep dives into combat deckbuilding games. After a few weeks of research I've become torn between a few options that not just look good, but also fit my budget.

First is [Shards of Infinity]
This game seems to play fast and have tons of strategy. I love the card art. Science and magic is such a cool mixture to me.

Second is [Hero Realms]
This honestly looks really similar to Shards of infinity, only it has a mideval fantasy design. I could be wrong though.

Third is [KeyForge]
Looks more complicated than the others, but that isn't a deterrent. I love the world-building the card art manages to achieve, and the rules seem to be interesting, albeit–as I said–complicated. It is a little out of my budget range, but looks like something I wouldn't regret sinking a little extra money into.

Fourth is [Star Realms]
To me, it looks to play similarly to Shards of Infinity and Hero Realms, but the low price tag makes me wary of it. I feel like ""Hm... what's going on here?"" Still looks good though. Although, I'm not a fan of the card art. 

Lastly is [Ascension]
Even more out of my budget, but this one looks REALLY interesting to me.

"I've recently been getting into TCGs with some friends, and I'd love to be able to make my own custom backs for my cards, as opposed to just using matte colored sleeves or something like that. But I haven't figured out a great way to do it yet. The obvious option is ordering custom printed sleeves from a company like Dragon Shield, and that currently seems like the best way, but at $25 it's not super cheap--especially if I want to be able to switch out the designs.

I can pretty easily get 100 2.5x3.5' light cardstock prints for under $5, and I initially thought I could just put a card and a printed custom back together in a clear sleeve, but it sounds like that's potentially damaging to the card.

-one of the rules of the game was that, during a certain action, one had to ring a little bell...the learner tried pointing out that it was useless, but the teacher was insistent on it

"As the title states, I've read about many of your board game vacations with friends and I set up one of my own. Myself and 4 college buddies are renting a cabin in the Finger Lakes region of NYS in january for some board gaming. It's been made clear this is a board game weekend with the expectations that we will play games most of the time. 

I am hoping to source some tips in terms of game order and speaking to my audience. I assure you I have searched the sub for ""how to teach Game X"" or games in general, so this isn't that general. 

**Context/Audience**

Everyone coming has played Catan or D&amp;D. None of them have played more modern board games such as Terraforming mars, etc. They are all avid video gamers though.

We'll arrive friday afternoon so we have friday afternoon/night, all saturday  and then sunday morning we leave. So not a ton of time. We're trying this for the first time.

I figure we could try all games once, and then see which one clicks and play that gain. As we know the first time you play isn't always the best experience. 

**Games**

I am bringing: 

\- Terraforming Mars

\- Agricola

\- Lords of the Waterdeep

\- Obscurio (need one fun ""party"" game for lack of a better term)

Maybe list: Carcassone, Burgle Brothers  


**Questions**

\- What can be carried over from video games/Catan to teach these games to people who have never played?

\- Are those good games for beginners? I know Agricola and Lords are a little close in terms of worker placement. 

\- What might be a good starter? I was thinking Agricola or Lords the first night, then try Mars the next day. 

\- Contradicting my intro slightly, any way to sum up the core of worker placement games for noobs? I saw a tip about summarizing it in terms of goals. I like that. 

\- Is there a good order you see there? Would one game maybe inform another/all? 

\-Is that too many games? Not enough? Sweet spot. 

\- Other tips in terms of expectation management? Should I try to keep people on task or let it flow organically and see which games hit?

"The monthly meetup met again, in a almost monthly fashion, hooray for holidays and in-laws staying over so I can escape for the weekend. Without further ado, the games:

Long Shot the Dice Game - This continues to be a favorite, played at 2 and 3. The 2 player came down to the last horse yet again, which made me worry that every game comes down to the last horse, but then in the 3 player game I managed to own all 3 horses that crossed the finish line and had some good bets too for a dominate win (and my first win ever). Absolutely great warm-up or drinking game. 

Street Masters - Another game I'm really digging, since its basically sentinels tactics, as in a tactics version of sentinels, not a reskin of sentinels tactics, which is more tactics then sentinels...oh dear I've gone cross-eyed. Anyway, we had Brandon and Natalia vs. the Marionette boss on Right to Remain Silent. Things were looking bleak in the first half until we managed to swap our positions on the board, giving up some tempo but it ended up with us better matched up with Natalia switching to the boss and Brandon on crowd control. Ended up getting the win.

Townsfolk Tussle - My second play of Townsfolk Tussle and I can probably stop lugging KD:M around since this gives me my fix. We thought we had the win as the Blacksmith and Candy Kid, then remembered that I was sheriff and died. Ah well, we'll try again next time.

Blood Bowl: Team Manager - One of two out of the dusts this weekend, we were a) drunk for this play and b) were reminded how fantastic a game it is. Of course, the combination of those two points led to us spending way too much money on the Foul Play expansion which has eluded us up to this point. At least I get to look forward to finally playing it next time we meet up.

Tiny Turbo Cars - One of two new games, this weekend, Tiny Turbo Cards takes those sliding tile puzzles you had in birthday party goody bags as a kid and turns it into a racing games. Overall I liked it, but there were some issues. First, we played at 2 so there wasn't much player interaction making the missile action pointless. Second, and much larger of a problem, is one of the tile puzzles wasn't sliding correctly on the bottom row. When a timer is moving and your device is stuck, it makes for a bad time. I'd try again but you can't have component issues in dex games. 

Civ: New Dawn - The second new to us game was Civ: New Dawn. I love Civ games, so I'm glad I got this to the table, and it did not disappoint. The way influence spread was cool, I really enjoyed the action selection system, and the playtime felt brisk for a genre known for overly long games. I hear the expansion makes it even better so I'll consider buying it (probably when drunk). 

Lords of Vegas - The other out of the dust game, and the only other game played at 3 instead of 2. We actually got in 2\* games, and I use the asterisk because we stopped the first game midway through when it came to light that someone forgot to shuffle the deck and it was in color order (its me, hi, I'm the problem its me). The second game with a shuffled deck was a ton of fun, and then I saw that there was a KS for new maps and...I don't know if that's necessary. But still, always glad to break this one out.

Outside of the meetup, I showed my in-laws So Clover which was a big hit with everyone, and we pushed farther into Gloomhaven jaws of the lion digital. I really prefer Gloomhaven as a digital entity so I'm curious how transitioning back to a table for Frosthaven will go now that we have it in hand. I'm not looking forward to the setup times.

"Only a small % of people who this is intended for will see it, but I wanted to say on behalf of myself, and I am sure all the other small indie developers, thank you for taking some of your convention time to visit us small indie developers and play our unheard of creations.

With all the good publisher games and the bells &amp; whistles of conventions, it is very kind that many of you spend hours playing at small indie booths.  Your interest, critiques &amp; suggestions go a long way to making our games better.  

For example, after a color blind man showed me what he sees when he looks at the game board, we had a discussion and I can make an easy adaption to my board and dice to make them accessible to most of the people who are color blind.  In addition, I added a new rule that works as a perfect catch up mechanic that was suggested by another Paxxer.  Finally repeated questions about a particular rule forced me to modify it to make it clearer and easier, and the changed actually improved the flow of the game.

I am not sure what an ARG or Ravensburger pays for playtesting, quality assurance, or 100's of co-designer minions with good ideas, but you guys give us indies all that for free when you visit our booths.  

But beyond your time &amp; your suggestions, the biggest thing you probably give the indie developers when you visit their booths is hope.  And for that I just want to say thank you, and I hope to see many of you, if not all of you, again next year.

"I had following idea for a board game and I am here to discuss it. So far the idea is just very broad concept, it is in no sense detailed, finished or perhaps even coherent so far.  


General aim:   


I want to combine game features and mechanics of games like chess with card games like poker to form something that could be also described as way more intricate and complex variant of stratego. From chess I want to borrow the idea of game pieces (cards or flat tokens in this case) being placed and moved across some type of chessboard with every type of piece having assigned set of allowed moves.  I also want to borrow the ability to attack and capture opponents game pieces and perhaps the general goal of capturing some specific oponent pieces to win the game. From card games I want to borrow feature of playing with chance and incomplete or disclosed information as well as ability to combine cards into combination of specific values. From stratego I want to borrow the possibility to hide the rank of your game piece from opponent as well as ability of the lowest value beating the highest value. But unlike in Stratego where the attack and capture is manner of 1 piece attacking 1 opponents piece, I want players to be able to coordinate attacks and defenses using multiple pieces in one turn in some way so it is not only individual pieces ranks that is relevant for counting who beats whom but the value of the whole combination of ranks. I would also want the game to be playable by more then just two players, perhaps 2-6 players would be very nice.   


More specific ideas:  


Playing cards or tokens: The card or token deck could be derived from french cards, but the deck could be altered adding new ranks or changing some to come closer to set of chess pieces even chaning amount of some rank in the deck. I would definitely want to include joker and ace which could be perhaps equivalent of spy. Colors could be tricky here. I would want all players to be able to use all colors in creation of their attacking or defense combinations. It seems to me that without it the possible combinations would become very narrow. On the other hand it would make some sense to ascribe every player specific color and make him able to manipulate only the tokens of his color, like it goes in chess. Three possible solutions come to my mind. Every card could be ascribed primary and seccondary color or shading. The primary color would be the color you take into acount in making combinations and could corespond to clasical card colors. Seccondary color or shading would mark what player the card belongs to. For example both players could have their own card deck with four primary colors but one player could have deck of dark version of cards while the opponent would have deck of light version of cards. In such a case the rear side of card would display only the seccondary color or shading of the card but not its primary color and rank. The seccond solution would be to give some rank (perhaps Joker) ability to grant the player possibility to charm and temporarily use oponents tokens in Jokers range as his own, move them or use them in their own attacks and defenses. But the problem here is that Jokers of clasical cards are themselves usually independent of colors and therefore there would have to be aditional rule defining who can use the Joker. Perhaps players could be required to make some form of sacrifice to be able to use Joker or the Joker leaning could change every round or depending on the color of the cell the Joker is standing on. There is also simple possibility of assigning each Joker some color so every player would have their own joker. The first solution could also be combined with seccond solution so every card has both primary and seccondary color (shading) but Jokers could still grant players ability to use oponents tokens. The third solution would be to make the cards or tokens primary color dependant on the color of the cell the token is curently placed on and this solution could also be combined with the previous two, if we make this chracteristic of only some specific ranks.  


Chessboard: Chessboard could be somewhat changed from clasical chessboard. It would be great to change the chessboard in such a way to allow for games from 2-4 or 2-6 players. Perhaps it could be changed from square cells to hexagonal cells. The colors of cells on chessboard could also change. Perhaps there could be as many colors of cells as the number of primary colors or the number of seccondary colors (shadings) or the cells could be differentiated by combination of both the primary and the seccondary colors (shading). Possibility to arange the colors into regular paterns poses some limitations here. The most important question here is what kind of function could colors on chessboard have. We already mentioned two possibilities. It could determine the player-leaning of Joker standing on the cell. It could also determine primary color of token standing on it if the primary color if that token is not set. As a third possibility, the color of the cells could play some role in determing the value or strenght of the combination of tokens  standing on those cells so certain group of tokens could beat some other group of tokens if standing on certain cells, but lose if standing on some other cells.  


Hiding and revealing of ranks and colors: I think of those cards or tokens as small flat pieces with one side displaying information about ranks and both primary and seccondary color, while the rear side displaying only the seccondary color. The player could place his tokens on board upside down to hide information about rank and primary color and carefully look anytime on the bottom if he forgets the information tho perhaps there could be limit of pieces player can check in one turn. Player can reveal the information anytime. Player must reveal the information if the token is participating in attack or defense.  


Placing of the pieces on board: At first i had idea for player to first get few random cards or tokens from his deck to his hand and be able to place one token every turn an get new one from the deck to the hand. But perhaps letting player arrange all of his tokens on the board at the beginíng as is done in stratego would be better.  


Movements, attack and defense: As I said, various ranks should have various movements possibilities like in chess. But for the player to be able to utilize the possibility to hide the rank it would be useful for all ranks to be able to make some basic moves that are not specific for that rank only so the opponent does not recongise the rank from movemet itself. Attack and defense could perhaps be devided into direct attack and defense and supportive attack and supportive defense. The token that moves to the position of the attacked token is considered direct attacker. All other players tokkens that coud have move there as well would be considered support. The attacked token is considered direct defender. The defending players tokens that could move to the position of the attacked token are considered support defender. Direct attacker together with support attackers constitue attacking combination while direct defender with supportive defenders constitue defending combination. The wining combination captures the oponent piece that directly participated in the combat. I was also thinking about making difference between melee atacks and range atacks, instead of direct and supportive and to give player possibility to place multiple of his own tokens on one cell, but perhaps this would complicate things too much.  


Theme and graphic design: I would like this game to use more symbolic and abstract design and take inspiration mostly from both, the chess and french cards but I could also see more thematic fantasy versions etc.","Idea for chess, stratego, poker hybrid.

"[https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/250412/mottainai-solo-variant-jiro](https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/250412/mottainai-solo-variant-jiro)

From the start this game seemed eminently solo-able. However, I have a pretty structured set of criteria for judging/designing a solo mode:

1) The variant must capture the spirit of the standard game  
2) The variant must minimize decision making on the part of the human player  
3) The variant must minimize bookkeeping and upkeep on the bot turn.

I  will always sacrifice an element lower down in service of a priority  above it.

There are already a handful of solo modes available on BGG, some reasonably good, but none really nailed the rubric. Many had complex hand-management rules for the bots or complex decision trees regarding wings and smith/craft actions. One introduced asymmetry on tasks, which streamlined things but also diluted the lead/follow tension in the game, where you have to judge if you can help yourself more than you help your opponent.

I'm confident that this version hits all three priorities. The Smith action draws heavily on Lehmann's Race for the Galaxy solo mechanic. It may take a run or two to really click but in the end it's simple to execute, if wordy to explain.

I consider  myself a medium level player and I am able to edge out Jiro most plays.

My little one is fairly into games - some of her favorites are Quest Kids, Guess Who, Dragon's Breath, and Magic Mountain. 

For Christmas we got her Quacks &amp; Co and My Little Stone Age.

"I am the primary teacher in multiple game groups. I frequently pitch new-to-us games to my people and because of that, I feel that it is my responsibility to learn those games beforehand. And frankly, I'm just better at teaching than a lot of the people in my group: my brain is good at learning complex games and then breaking them down into digestable parts. I also put in the work beforehand by reading the rulebook, setting up the game and playing through a few turns, and checking BGG's ""Rules"" forums to see if there are any frequently asked questions, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes I will teach a game to a table where one other person happens to have played the game before. It is EXTREMELY annoying when that other person interrupts my teach to elaborate on something that I myself am going to elaborate on later. When you interrupt me to add information, you prompt the newbies to deluge me with questions that I'm going to answer in just a few minutes. It derails us and makes the process take longer than necessary.

I was probably even guilty of this earlier in my gaming ""career"", so I make a special effort not to do this when others are teaching.

"I’m always on the hunt for games that are equally fun for kids and adults. Here are five games worth considering for stockings this holiday season:

**Windmill: Cute Secrets**

One of the most straightforward storytelling games around. There’s a grid of 25 large cards with stunning artwork, and a smaller deck of cards featuring the same art. Each turn one player is the storyteller, drawing a card and sharing a brief story. The other players try to guess which card the story was about, and if a player guesses correctly, both the storyteller and guesser receive points. The number of points goes up by one for each incorrect guess, so there’s a benefit to telling ever-so-slightly vague stories … but if a story is TOO vague and no one guesses, the storyteller loses a point! Once each player has had two turns to tell a story, the game is over. Great creative fun for young and old!

**Ouch!**

This is a quick push-your-luck card game about trying not to get pricked by a cactus. Six cards are face-down on the table, and players take turns picking one side of one card, and flipping it over. If their fingers are pinching flowers or sand, keep the card. If they’re pinching a cactus, though, shout “OUCH!” and discard that card instead. The number of flowers on the backs of the cards indicate how many sides of the card may be covered in cacti, so you can go for the easy gets, or push it to get the bigger payday. Each flower collected is worth 1 point, each full set of flowers is worth a bonus of 5, and whoever has the most red flowers gets another bonus 5 points. Easy peasy!

**Mountain Goats**

In the vein of Can’t Stop, players are rolling four dice, pairing them up, and using those values to move their goats up a mountain. Reach the top of a column to win a point chip, and if you can stay at the top, you’ll receive another chip every time you roll that value! But if another player reaches the top, they kick the other goat all the way down to the bottom. Get to the top of each peak to win a bonus chip, and the game ends when either three stacks of regular chips are exhausted, or all the bonus chips are gone. This is one is quick and addictive, with a low barrier to entry allowing kids to get in on the fun!

**Loose Caboose!**

There’s a runaway train caboose on the loose, and we’ve got to quickly build tracks to keep it from going off the rails! After each turn, players will be rolling dice to see how far the train moves, and if it goes off the rail on your turn, penalty cards are collected for each move the train couldn’t make. It’s tempting to try and set the next player up for a disastrous turn, but there’s always a risk when not playing it safe! This one is from Gamewright, who are well-known for their family friendly games - but this one also offers a fun ride for adults too!

**Downtown Farmers Market**

Build a grid of groceries, and try to fulfill the goal tiles along the top and side of your grid. Players draw from a face-up row of tiles to fill their grid, and while the turns are simple, the decisions can get crunchy! For younger players, there’s a set of “young farmer” rules, making the game more accessible and less brain-burn-inducing. Great thinky fun for both little players and big ones!

"I just had idea for interesting kind of game play and I am curious if there are some games like this. The idea is the combination of abstract combinatorial strategic games and social deduction games. I would be also interested in certain similar games even if they include elements of logical deduction games or some bluffing deduction and betting games.

By abstract combinatorial games I mean something like chess, checkers, go, backgammon, tic tac toe etc

Example of social deduction game with secret roles or team membership could be mafia, among us, secret hitler, bang etc. Most typically there is one player who is secretly playing against others and have opposite winning conditions, but players could also be arranged into teams without knowing who plays with whom or there could be various roles all with its own unique winning conditions

By deduction games I mean games like black box and mastermind.

By bluffing deduction game I mean games like poker. Also this kind of mechanics could be used instead of social deduction and secret roles especially if the game allows players to form something like temporary alliances etc.

Combining those elements could result in very interesting strategic game with great dynamics.

So I am curious if you know of any such games. Also I am curious about your ideas regarding it. Do you find it interesting? How would you design such a game? What features would you use?",Do you know of any abstract combinatorial game with secret assignment of roles or teams?,1,self.boardgames,zcmpmx,Mapafius,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/zcmpmx/do_you_know_of_any_abstract_combinatorial_game/,1670190204

"Hi everyone, 

I just opened a copy of Clash of Cultures that I had in shrink for a few months, only to find that it must have gotten a rather serious hit at some point. Effectively, the lid is in good shape (which is why I didn't notice prior to removing the shrink), but two of the corners on the bottom box (which holds the components) are fully split. Its a peculiar form of damage and I know its likely impossible for me to get a replacement. Given the heftiness of the game's components, however, I would like to reinforce the box. 

I'm not *so* concerned about aesthetics in this case, because these corners will bit hidden most of the time by the lid. **I'm curious if anyone knows of any easy, cheap ways of reinforcing such broken box corners.** In particular, I feel like there has to be a thin but strong form of tape that would help? Perhaps something black, given that the bottom box is almost entirely black itself. 

Thank you in advance!

"My group was super into gaming but fell off of it in covid era. We've got back into it mildly in past months, and I'm looking to pickup some must-plays that I don't have.  Here's a list of our favorites:

Scythe - I have Invaders from Afar but we normally just play 3-4p.  Love that this game feels deep but plays faster and lighter than others.  Love that there's combat but not the main purpose.

Eclipse - this is the most random we'd like to go but it does end up being a crowd favorite.

Caverna - absolutely love it but it can become too formulaic and it also takes a really long time. Certain rooms are too powerful and can make or break your game.

Terra Mystica - great game, I've heard Gaia Project is better but it seems too similar to warrant a pickup.

Trajan - crunchier than the others on this list. Other Felds we play are Amerigo (lighter and faster) and BoraBora (not as strategically diverse as Trajan, not as favorite)

Some of us are RPGers too, so I don't mind games that go that direction as well...

Cthulhu: Death May Die - hard to have a consistent group week by week but we like the collab combat and strategy.

Also honorable mention to:

Viticulture EE - great that it's faster playing than most others. A bit random but still a crowd favorite.

Istanbul - only played it a few times but really liked it.  Don't own it though. This also fits this lighter / faster playing category... Games that are shorter tend to hit the table more often.

Race for the Galaxy - played the crap out of it when we first got it and kinda over did it.

Any recommendations?  Really looking for something similar to Scythe, Eclipse, Caverna, but perks if it's quicker playing ( not a necessity, but a perk)

"Hello everyone. 

Premise: I’m on full pirate fixation and I was looking for a pirate board game. As expected, there’s a bunch of them around. Generally I’m more on the heavier/thematic side so two of them which are often recommended caught my eye, Merchants and Marauders and Dead Reckoning. DR is the shiny new thing with very good artwork and some interesting mechanics so I was considering joining the new KS campaign but I’m concerned over how thematic it really is, which for me is number one priority. It seems to me there are some inconsistencies and incongruous aspects in the game and I wonder if the expansions fix them.

I’ve seen a few reviews but I didn’t read the rule book so I hope you would forgive me if I miss rules and other stuff.

1. Battles. I don’t mind luck (love Star Wars Rebellion and battles there don’t bother me much, plus I like cinematic tactic cards) but in DR they feel uninspiring. You throw dice, maybe you sink the opponent’s boat but in the end everybody gets boon. Now, I expected pirates boarding ships to be a bloody affair, with the chance of losing crew members in the fight (maybe with mechanics to grant more experience to the survivors or more easily recruit new and better sailors). There’s no dread in a fight.
Another thing: I wish two player could momentarily team up against a third player, for example to raid and plunder his fort.

2. Buildings. Protecting a valuable island is fine but I don’t want a game where you have to build infrastructures all over to win. I’d imagine islands to be wild and uncharted, with the occasional pirate cove, not an thick net of organized trade hubs.

3. Exploration. In the newest expansion I see there’s prime cargo. But it doesn’t feel like finding a treasure. I’m not expecting to solve puzzles but at least some mechanic do that you have a chance to obtain riches the longer your explorer/ship stays on an island.

4. Narrative/Supernatural. Maybe cliché but I’d love some sea story fantasy in it. Sea monsters that eat (“kidnaps” for a few turn) some of your sailors, mermaids that distract your crew from combat, native tribes that steal your cargo, maelstroms that force your ship to deviate from rout, ghost ships that raid your islands, voodoo artifacts… Stuff like that.

Is it really nothing like that? Do the expansion fix/add the things I mention?

I would like to hear your opinion before pulling the trigger on such an expensive game.

My Questions are:

First: regarding ""Bonuses on stats"", if I have ""Sword of Saint Jerome"" artifact and a ""Scales of Thoth"" artifact... Is it right to assume the highest ""skill bonus"" is the only one to be used as a ""modifier"" and that is ""Sword of Jerome's"" Bonuses being ""higher"" than ""Scales of Thoth"", despite ""Scales of Thoth's passive ability"" of having the ""Investigator's Life and Sanity being equal giving them a ""passive +2 Bonus on all their skills""""?

Second: ""Do you only use ""one"" Item and their bonuses, when dealing encounters and combat encounters?""

Third: ""Can you use other Assets Abilities like Trinkets, ""Luck Rabbit's Foot"" or an Ally Asset"" to ""Reroll Dices"" freely?""

Fourth: When ""using spells"" and ""gain bonuses to your skills"" like ""Wither"", ""Can the spells bonuses stack with your other ""Highest Bonus Asset or the same rule of ""you can only use the asset/spell that has a highest bonus number and the only modifier to your skills rule""?

Fifth: If a Investigator dies during a ""Encounter Card specifying ""death"" as a failure"", are they ""devoured"" or ""are they put in a Life Token Defeated state""? Or does the ""Encounter Card get a ""specific aftermath rule of their defeat"". Does a ""Encounter Card"" or a ""Mythos Card"" with that ""kind of Fail Effect"" exist too?

##FAQ

**I live in Ecuador/Canada/Jamaica/USA, why are you posting on a Saturday?!**

Because I'm writing this from Europe in the future where it's already Sunday. Timezones be crazy.

**Why are there a bunch of non-board games in the board game list?**

Because the Tabletop games category on Kickstarter includes anything remotely related to board games and sometimes things slip through my filters.

**Why is this future award winning board game and literal saviour of humanity missing from your list?**

Sometimes my filters get a bit overzealous and discard actually valid projects. If you feel something is missing for this reason, leave a comment and I'll add it (maybe).

**Can I donate all my money to you?**

No

**Can you help me promote my game?**

Please no. I make lists. Nothing more.

**Your list is full of errors and now the Nigerian prince won't answer my emails anymore!**

Indeed, this fine piece of code runs purely on hope and dreams, so anything can happen. Leave a comment and I'll see what I can do.

*(BGG geeklist is* [*here*](https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/306064/woodfordays-top-50-games-2022)*)*

**50 - Cascadia**

This is the perfect ""coffee table"" game for me and my wife. We'll often have a game of it going on the side while we blob out and watch a show or a movie in the evening. It's a delightful little game with interesting decisions delivered in bite-sized pieces, and the scoring cards give it a decent amount of replayability and variety. And Beth Sobel's art is, of course, an absolute joy.

**49 - Cosmic Encounter**

There was a time where I had this as my #1 game, and I was sure that would never change. It still holds a special place in my heart, and it still comes out now and then when we're in the mood for a pure fun, chaotic experience. Interestingly, I never bothered with the expansions; perhaps I should give them a try.

**48 - Viticulture**

Viticulture as a theme doesn't interest me at all, but I really do love this game. It pushes all the right buttons for me in terms of action efficiency, and the way it marries up order fulfilment with the aging of grapes/wine is brilliant. I consider the Tuscany expansion essential.

**47 - Dice Throne**

Pure asymmetrical battling fun in a box. Well, several large boxes; we have everything for this excluding Adventures (so Season 1 Rerolled, Season 2, and Marvel) and it's all fantastic. The heroes feel very different, the dice-chucking is satisfying, and the card-play is impactful. Not bad at all for what is essentially an evolution of Yahtzee!

**46 - Sleeping Gods**

This game really is all about the stories contained within it, and thankfully they're fantastic. That said, I also enjoy the maintenance and combat, and find the whole experience very compelling. Fun (or not-so-fun) bit of trivia: This game got me through a particularly nasty bout of COVID - good times! Very much looking forward to the next chapter in this adventure.

**45 - Android Netrunner**

I got into this in a big way many years ago, when it was still in print. I've been meaning to try out the new fan-made versions. There's really nothing quite like this in existence, it's a true masterpiece of two-player asymmetric game design. So many wonderful memories of making white-knuckled sweaty runs, praying that my opponent didn't have a trap waiting for me (even though they inevitably always did). If this was still in print and easily accessible, it would probably be higher on my list.

**44 - Blood Rage**

My favourite Eric Lang game, and one of the best drafting games ever made (not to mention minis-on-a-map and area control). The fact that it can be just as beneficial to win combat as it can be to lose is genius and adds a lot of intriguing tension. Such a fun experience every time. ABHDL (Always Be Hate-Drafting Loki).

**43 - The Age of Atlantis**

A surprising newcomer to the list! I really wasn't expecting to enjoy this as much as I have, but it's an excellent game. The rulebook is a hot mess and desperately needs a re-write, but once you get past that there's a lot of good stuff going on here. Much like Scythe, mixing up the different player boards adds a lot of variety and dramatically changes the feel of the game. The morale mechanism alongside upgrading workers to Atlanteans forms an especially clever almost push-your-luck approach to worker placement. Plus the whole thing looks fantastic on the table. A few people have complained about the quality of the cards and the resource trackers but honestly I haven't found either of those things to be issues at all.

**42 - Clans of Caledonia**

Another one that used to be much higher on my list. Very similar to Terra Mystica and Gaia Project in a lot of ways, but ultimately feels different enough to be it's own thing. The market system is very clever and adds a good amount of additional interactivity, and the central point-scoring mechanism of order fulfilment works very well with the theme of the game. Always happy to play this one.

**41 - Argent: The Consortium**

Possibly the meanest worker placement game in existence. Different types of workers behaving differently is clever and interesting, and the end-game scoring being effectively a hidden goals system is extremely unique. Plus, there's an absolutely ridiculous amount of variability with all the different locations and cards. I adore this game and wish I had more people to play it with.

**40 - Mechs vs. Minions**

This was the first truly big-box, deluxe board game I ever owned, and it holds up to this day. Putting the gorgeous production aside, the gameplay is pure action programming fun. There's something so satisfying about trying to control the chaos of your mechs in the early game, and eventually becoming devastating minion stomping machines by the end - hopefully in time to complete the objective! The variety in missions is excellent, and it's bursting with great ideas executed well. Also, the secret box doesn't disappoint.

**39 - Dwellings of Eldervale**

My initial impressions were that this would be a ""candy game""; there's a lot of stuff going on that initially seems loosely connected at best, and it's all very vibrantly colourful and overproduced. However, it is a very solid game underneath all the bling, and I've had a ton of fun with it every time. The tempo of the game (placing workers out to do stuff, then eventually taking them back to do different stuff, rinse and repeat) is very satisfying and feels unique, and there's a lot of very strong player interaction for what is ultimately a rather thinky euro.

**38 - The Search for Planet X**

I've always enjoyed Cryptid, and consider it a genius work of design in how it uses only physical components to create a variable setup pure deduction game. The Search for Planet X is also a pure deduction game, but it requires an app, and despite my initial reservations because of that, it is the better game for it. My favourite pure deduction game by far, and one I'm always willing to play. The fact that it uses a rondel to simulate opportunity cost is just icing on the cake.

**37 - New Frontiers**

Puerto Rico was one of my favourite games for a long time, but it has a bunch of problems, such as its representation of ""colonists"" and the way seating order can significantly impact the outcome of a game. New Frontiers entirely replaces Puerto Rico for me, and it does so with a more interesting theme (for me) and more rigorous mechanisms. Yes, the resource cubes are way too big for what they are, and the box takes up way too much space, but it's such a good game that I can't hold either of those issues against it.

**36 - Crokinole**

By far my favourite dexterity game, and one of the best ""we don't know what else to play"" games out there. Incredibly easy to teach and play, but with a surprising amount of depth for what it is. We love crokinole so much that we actually have two boards for it (pro tip: if you need extra justification for buying a crokinole board, they make striking wall art). Some day we'll finally get around to hosting a tournament...

**35 - Scythe**

I remember desperately trying to source a copy of this back when it was hard to find in little ol' NZ, but nowadays it's everywhere! One of the two games I've bought a big-box wooden insert for (the other being Firefly; spoilers for later). Scythe is always a hit with every group I play it with, and is suitable for gamers of any experience level. There are always interesting decisions to make, but due to the simple action selection mechanism it never feels paralyzing. Doesn't hurt that it looks amazing on the table. Also, the Fenris expansion takes it to the next level in terms of the variety it adds.

**34 - 18Chesapeake**

In my opinion, this is the best entry-point to one of my favourite board game sub-genres, 18xx. I've taught it to multiple groups with great success, and virtually everyone has wanted more afterwards. The export system is a simple, clever way to keep the game moving in games where people aren't buying many trains, and the map is interesting and covers a wide variety of classic 18xx situations. Sure, it isn't as cutthroat or tightly balanced as some other titles, but it is perfect for what it is. The 3-hour playtime alone makes it worthwhile (there's no better way to turn people off a genre than mentioning that most of the options take 6-12 hours).

**33 - Gùgōng**

Something about the way this game combines hand management with worker placement really gets my gears turning. It's an immensely clever system. Then you add the various locations on the board that effectively work like minigames, while still feeling cohesive and interrelated, and it all comes together in a very satisfying package. It's so much fun to play, with a healthy mix of tactics and strategy to keep the brain burning. I haven't yet tried the expansion but it looks like it adds even more interesting and impactful options, so very much looking forward to it.

**32 - Reef Encounter**

The theme is very unusual and at times downright silly. The mechanisms are essentially a bizarre mixture of tile placement and stock-market manipulation. There's an element of hidden-but-trackable information which one could argue is poor design. On paper, I should hate this game, but it's incredible. Richard Breese is some kind of mad genius.

**31 - Race for the Galaxy**

Safe to say this is my favourite pure card game (if you ignore the point chits). There aren't many games that are more satisfying once you get going with that perfect point-scoring engine, only to realise at the end that you underestimated your opponent's military juggernaut and they've blown you out of the water by 20 points (ahem, that definitely doesn't happen to me anymore). Sure, the iconography isn't exactly pretty, but it is extremely functional and essentially disappears with enough plays. It's a rare thing when a game can take 20 minutes and yet feel like a completely satisfying experience. The only thing keeping me from playing it more often is a lack of opponents; perhaps I should try an online implementation.

**30 - Earth Reborn**

I got this in a math trade a number of years ago, and was blown away by how good this tactical skirmish game with a B-movie aesthetic really is. The barrier to entry is quite large, as it effectively requires you to play through numerous scenarios of escalating complexity to fully learn the game, but it is well worth it. There is so much depth here that it's almost absurd (seriously, check out [this rulebook **summary**](https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/64227/summarises-all-rules-pdf) \- sheesh), but it all comes together incredibly well and the theme shines through wonderfully. This is the game I most want to see remastered.

**29 - Firefly: The Game**

We own everything ever made (barring some rare promos and the big money), including a massive wooden crate to store it all in, and despite the nearly overwhelming amount of... stuff, it is an absolute treat every time we play. One of the best examples of thematic integration and fun-first gameplay out there. There's nothing quite like exploring the 'verse with a bunch of friends (and maybe stabbing them in the back while you're at it).

**28 - The Quacks of Quedlinburg**

This game, with all the expansions and the deluxified chips, is almost always the game of choice when we're trying to bring newbies into the hobby. It is immediately satisfying to pull those chips out of the bag, and the temptation to pull just. one. more. chip is delicious. Even better when you're watching someone else think about it, think some more, slowly reach into the bag... only to pull out the 3 Cherry Bomb and bust. It's always a raucous experience, even if the luck heavily outweighs the strategy. If you hate Quacks, you might hate fun... and that's okay! But I love it.

**27 - Great Western Trail**

On it's own, Great Western Trail is an excellent euro. With the Rails to the North expansion, it is a masterpiece. So many interlocking mechanisms and interesting decisions to make, in which buildings you place and where, to how far along the rondel you move at once, to how you construct your deck. Rails especially fixes some slight balance issues (e.g., it's almost always best to deliver to Kansas ASAP) and makes many different strategies much more viable. It's astonishing that a game primarily built around building a deck of cows is so much fun, but it really is.

**26 - Crisis**

This is a real underrated gem of a worker placement game that more people need to know about. It is a semi-cooperative game where you play as business leaders trying to make bank in a time of economic uncertainty. The fact that everyone is responsible for keeping the economy afloat works brilliantly to keep a sense of tension while not being overbearing. You really don't want to be left holding the bag when Axia collapses into turmoil. The way it simulates an economy with internal production vs importing is also excellent, and really drives the theme of the game home. Plus it's just good fun to build your engine of companies into a well-oiled resource-producing machine.

**25 - Trick Shot**

As a Canadian, I am legally obligated to enjoy anything and everything related to hockey. Despite all that, the reason I love this game so much is in fact because it is fantastic. By far my favourite sports board game implementation, the turn-to-turn luck pushing via the dice combined with the almost chess-like positional play, all masterfully woven into the theme, makes for a great experience every time. Artyom Nichipurov is quickly becoming one of my favourite designers, and I'm very much looking forward to the second edition.

**24 - Troyes**

It's pronounced ""twah"". Right, now that that's out of the way, I'm a big fan of Troyes. It's one of the meaner euro games out there, in that you can snatch dice away from other players that they were hoping to use. However, when you do this, they get money that they can then use to do the same in turn, so it never feels so mean as to be brutal, and it is more of an opportunistic mechanism than a back-stabby one. The semi-cooperative aspect of trying to defend the city from bad stuff is also done quite well. There's so much variety here and every game feels fresh and different with the wide variety of cards that completely change the game. My favourite euro involving dice as a central mechanism.

**23 - Townsfolk Tussle**

This was quite a big surprise for me. I was expecting an experience with wonderful art and a fun theme, but not much substance. The truth is that Townsfolk Tussle is a boss battler that, while relatively light, punches well above its weight. You'll fight through four random bosses through escalating levels of difficulty, with the first being relatively easy and the last being a real challenge. Between the battles, you'll experience random events and buy equipment. The bosses all feel very different, the items change the game up a lot, and all combined results in a different-feeling game filled with interesting decisions every time. Despite the long playtime, I'm always up to play through this one.

**22 - Everdell**

Everdell is my go-to game for introducing folks new to the board gaming hobby to slightly heavier fare, and it always works. The base game is a lot of fun and quite easy to teach, while encompassing a fairly wide range of common mechanisms. Working out and executing the optimal engine is very satisfying. Not to mention the wonderful table presence. However, it really comes to life when you add the expansions. Spirecrest in particular is fantastic, adding different incentives (and disincentives) to moving through the seasons, and more interesting scoring options. We have the (ridiculously huge) Complete Collection and haven't yet managed to play the two new expansions, but they look great as well.

**21 - Mage Knight**

This is a massive, intimidating puzzle in a box. It's a tough one to get to the table, even solo, because of how long it takes to setup, play, and teardown, but it is remarkable and a true masterpiece of adventure game design. It has one of the best implementations of multi-use cards, which is one of my favourite mechanisms (potential spoilers for the rest of my list), combined with a host of other brilliant aspects that all work together to become a gripping, fun experience every time. It does hurt my brain, though, and I can't help but feel like it might be even higher in my list I didn't feel like I need to relearn it every time I play.

**20 - Keyflower**

I love Keyflower, it does so many things so well and is always fun every time I play, and I often find myself daydreaming about it while playing other euros. There's also a bit of a nostalgic factor, as it's one of the earlier games in my collection that really stuck with me. One of my formative gaming memories was playing Keyflower 1v1 with my wife on the floor of our old apartment on a stormy winter day. Also, to this day I am convinced that bidding with workers is one of the cleverest combinations of mechanisms in games.

**19 - Tzolk'in: The Mayan Calendar**

The way Tzolk'in represents the passage of time by using massive gears that slowly turn is sublime. It is so much more than a physical gimmick. In my view, it is one of the finest examples of a game that, on paper, seems like it should be overly convoluted and contrived, yet feeling perfectly elegant and natural whenever it is played. The base game is excellent, but the Tribes &amp; Prophecies expansion cranks it up yet another notch and makes it one of my favourite games.

**18 - Age of Steam**

This is not a game I would play with just anyone, it requires a certain mindset to properly enjoy. It is incredibly mean, cutthroat, and an early misplay can destroy your whole game. It almost feels like a push-your-luck game, in that in order to beat tough competition, you often need to over-leverage yourself and dance on the edge of a knife. Quite possibly the tightest game I've ever played, with the highest highs in gaming coming from a strategy planned and executed successfully. It is phenomenal.

**17 - 1822: The Railways of Great Britain**

This glorious monstrosity of a euro cleverly disguised as an 18xx is my favourite ""event game"" (i.e., take the whole day off and order pizza). There's a ton going on, and if you play with people new to 18xx, they'll probably have a bad time, but once everyone knows what they're doing and the turns go by quickly, there aren't many experiences like it. I especially love the absolutely bonkers amount of bidding that takes place, leading to lots of interesting decisions and game states. And there are quite a few variants out there to give it legs if the base game ever wears out (hah, as if).

**16 - Le Havre**

A good storage/setup solution is essential for this one, but once that's sorted, it's one of the best tableau builders out there, with an incredible amount of variety in the cards and the order they come out in. Even the different order of the ship track can change the game feeling significantly. Not my favourite Uwe game (spoilers), but it is a delight nonetheless.

**15 - 1830: Railways &amp; Robber Barons**

My first, and favourite, 18xx. I adore everything about this game. From the opening auction of private companies, to the map layout and position of public companies, to the stock market, to the train count and pacing. The only reason I don't play it more in person is the long playtime, but I almost always have a game going online.

**14 - Gloomhaven**

The best dungeon-crawler ever, bar none. I've played this dozens of times and almost every game has been down to the wire, filled with some of my most memorable board gaming moments. The card play is pure genius. The sheer amount of content, all of it interesting and unique, is breath-taking. The only downside is the extensive setup/teardown time (even with the app) and the sometimes-unintuitive AI (although this quickly becomes a non-issue with enough plays). I'm very much looking forward to trying Jaws of the Lion some day, as it seems like it solves a lot of those issues.

**13 - Barrage**

A relative newcomer to the list. The idea of a game based around building dams and ""catching"" water to generate power didn't appeal to me at all, but I was hooked from the first time I tried it. The theme seems like it should be dry (something something water pun) but it flows (oops, there I go again) so well. I absolutely love the feeling when someone thinks they've thwarted my plans by grabbing a particular droplet, only to realise that they've opened up the floodgates (please stop) for a whole new, better option for me. Even the worker placement and the simple rondel for building feel so satisfying.

**12 - Agricola**

The first ""heavier"" game I ever played (compared to games like Catan and Dominion), and it has withstood the test of time. Despite the fact that my wife virtually always beats me, I still love this game and will play it with her any time. The potential for runaway combos of cards means that playing with a draft is really essential for people who know what they're doing, but it is one of those games where a draft adds more fun, rather than just friction, as it gives you more of an opportunity to deliberately try out different strategies. Also, we see Farmers of the Moore as mandatory (and amazing), but that may be just us.

**11 - Oath: Chronicles of Empire and Exile**

The first Cole Wehrle game on my list, but certainly not the last (spoilers), this is a glorious experience that is more about the memories you make than the moment-to-moment gameplay (although it is certainly no slouch in that area either). The fact that each game impacts the next is, quite simply, brilliant, and leads to some truly fantastic meta-gaming. King-making becomes a legitimate strategy, because if you know you're down-and-out in this particular outing, you can at least put yourself in the future Chancellor's good books and win some favour for the next one. If that sounds awful to you, I can't in good conscience recommend Oath to you, but if it sounds even remotely intriguing, I promise you: It's wonderful. An incredible achievement that accomplishes exactly what it sets out to, creating an overarching narrative that outlasts the time at the table.

**10 - A Feast for Odin**

My love for the worker placement genre goes back many years, starting with Uwe's classic Agricola, but none come close to matching this in my mind. Yes, it has a ludicrous amount of bits, but they all have their place. Yes, it has more placement locations than ten other games of the genre combined, but they are so brilliantly designed that it's never overwhelming. Yes, the geospatial puzzle only works with the Viking theme if you put on dark glasses and squint heavily, but any game that makes me say ""Oooooooh, beans!"" delightedly multiple times is clearly nailing it in the theme department. Add in the Norwegians expansion to trim the loose ends and you have a bona fide masterpiece.

**9 - Root**

Another Cole Wehrle title! Root was one of my earliest introductions to heavy asymmetry, which is an aspect of games that fascinates me to this day. The idea that everyone at the table could be playing what is effectively a completely different game, with strong interaction between factions, and every permutation thereof resulting in a unique experience? Mind-blowing. And the art really takes it to the next level. Root is a remarkable feat of game design while somehow being enormously fun to play, and it isn't even Cole's masterpiece (again, spoilers).

**8 - Ark Nova**

The rise of Ark Nova to the top of the board gaming charts has been meteoric, to say the least, but deservedly so. It doesn't do much that is truly unique or innovative, but rather blends existing mechanisms in such a perfect way that it feels like an entirely new thing. I am especially enamoured with just how lovingly the theme is captured; it really feels like you're grappling with running a zoo, trying to balance the need for ticket sales with the greater good of conservation. The use of the escalating action selection mechanism (borrowed from Through the Ages) is especially inspired, and ties the whole thing together into an incredibly satisfying experience.

**7 - Brass: Birmingham**

My favourite economic game, there is something so delightfully crunchy about Brass: Birmingham. The interaction is so exquisite and every decision so impactful. I especially love the fact that in the canal era, you're effectively vying for positioning in the rail era where the REAL points are scored, but how you want that positioning to shake out entirely depends on the market locations which differ from game-to-game, meaning that no two eras, let alone games, ever feel the same. The card play is also absolutely brilliant, and despite the dark aesthetic, it is gorgeous on the table. I still need to get my hands on some iron clays to really pull it all together.

**6 - High Frontier 4 All**

This is, by far, the most intimidating game I've ever played. It's jaw-dropping how accurately it simulates space exploration, and yet once learned it's pretty easy to remember how everything works. My preferred way to play, at least so far, is a friendly goal-based approach. Everyone picks goals that seem fun to accomplish (e.g., landing on Mars) and goes for them, not worrying about scoring. Perhaps after a couple dozen games, I'll want to get more competitive with it, but as it is it's such an entertaining and engrossing puzzle that I haven't felt the need. I'll never forget the first time I successfully landed on Mars.

**5 - Spirit Island**

By far my favourite one-and-done cooperative game, there is so much to love about Spirit Island (aka ""reverse Catan""). The spirits all feel wildly different to play as, the scenarios are rich and impactful, and even the power cards that come into play can change the game significantly. Especially when the numerous expansions are added in, there aren't many games that come close in terms of sheer replayability. Figuring out the puzzle is always a pleasant headscratcher, and if it ever isn't, just increase the difficulty! Finally, I love how it solves the alpha gamer issue by quite simply being too difficult to quarterback (or alternatively, by being excellent solo). If you're trying to manage what everyone else at the table is doing, you're probably failing miserably yourself.

**4 - The 7th Continent**

I am convinced that no other game pulls you into its world quite like 7th Continent. It is effectively an optimisation puzzle disguised as a choose-your-own-adventure novel in board (well, card) game form, and it is a masterstroke of genius in how well it pulls it off. My wife and I spent more than 20 hours solving the first curse (effectively a complete campaign) together, then at least another 50 hours across some of the other curses, and we loved every second of it. It can be punishing, so you need to know that going in, but with a few basic survival tips in mind (e.g., hunt often), it is just the right amount of difficult to make the experience that much more rewarding when you figure it out. There is a truly absurd amount of game even in the core box alone, and it gets ludicrous when you add in all the expansions on top. I'm not sure I'll ever see it all, but I'm sure going to try.

**3 - Pax Pamir: Second Edition**

Can you guess who my favourite designer is? Yup, it's Cole Wehrle by a mile. Pax Pamir 2e is an absolutely essential masterpiece that creates experiences at the table like no other. Despite its undeniable weight, everything makes intuitive sense, and the complexity leads to amazing, unforeseen plays. It's one of the games that I most often hear the words ""Oh, WELL done!"" said by someone at the table in response to a move (often a last-minute change of allegiances). It is also one of the most beautiful games ever made, with its unconventional components and strikingly thematic artwork, right down to the pattern on the inside of the box.

**2 - Gaia Project**

I have played Gaia Project dozens of times and every single time I love it more. There are so many things to think about before even picking (or bidding on, if everyone is experienced enough) a faction. The end-game scoring, the round scoring, the position of basic and advanced tech tiles, the position of planets on the board... It's an incredible puzzle every time, and the process of trying to solve it while jostling for position with the other players is one of the best experiences in board games. This game pushes all the right buttons for me and I am literally always willing to play it.

**1 - Guards of Atlantis II**

It's entirely possible you've never even heard of it, but Guards of Atlantis II is a masterpiece of game design. Anyone who knows me won't be surprised that it is, by far, my favourite game of all time. But don't take my word for it; I've played it now more than 20 times with more than 20 different people, and have never had it fall flat, and have had many others proclaim it their favourite as well. It is constantly requested, and we've even had multiple public holidays dedicated to playing it. The best way to describe it is a team game that plays from 2p to 10p (with a variant to support odd numbers), based on the MOBA video game genre where every player controls a different hero with completely unique abilities, and the goal is to either kill off the opposing heroes enough times, or help your team's NPC minions push forward into the opposing team's home base by killing the opposing team's minions. The gameplay is deceptively simple, with the decision space being mind-bogglingly deep. It's also exceptionally well-balanced despite having 22 VERY different heroes. The team aspect really makes it shine, resulting in some of the highest highs (and lowest lows) to be found in gaming. Nothing even comes close to touching this as my favourite game, and I suspect it will stay that way for a very, very long time.

**Honourable mentions**   
*(Games that technically made the list when I ranked but I haven't played them enough to be sure)*

**Would've been 60:  Yellow &amp; Yangtze**

I enjoyed the predecessor, Tigris &amp; Euphrates, but never really fell in love with it like so many people do (that said, I still play the mobile implementation now and then). My single play of Yellow &amp; Yangtze was fantastic. It didn't have as many of the big game-shattering moments of T&amp;E, but seemed much... friendlier, somehow. And the progression/escalation throughout the game was very satisfying. Looking forward to playing it more.

**Would've been 52: Viscounts of the West Kingdom**

This is one of the most Vital Lacerda games I've played made by someone not named Vital Lacerda. I was very impressed, and thoroughly enjoyed it. All the mechanisms seem somewhat disparate at first, until you start to see how they all come together, and the card-play is extremely unique and satisfying. Strong potential to become my favourite Shem Phillips game.

**Would've been 47: Rising Sun**

I'm still not completely sure how I feel about this one, although truth be told it hasn't fully left my head since I played it. I'm convinced that it can't be well-balanced (even basic things like not everyone getting the same number of turns in a relatively turn-poor game), but the decision-space is extremely interesting and the politicking seems like it has a lot of potential for high-level play. Definitely keen to play it more, but not sure how well it'll hold up over time.

**Would've been 42: Glen More II: Chronicles**

This was immediately one of my favourite tile placement games, really blew me away. There are a lot of just plain fun things about this, from the rondel mechanism for determining the current player (think Patchwork), to the spatial puzzle when placing tiles and the way it massively escalates as you build up your little clan, to the sideboard and the little treats it provides throughout the game. The lavish production doesn't hurt either.

**Would've been 37: Heroscape**

I have played WITH Heroscape for many, many hours. The toy factor verges on ridiculous and building maps with the terrain in particular is perfect for kids (as long as you don't let them apply too much pressure to the water and swamp tiles - whoops). Plus, the pre-painted minis are great fun, and I have multiple duplicated sets (for terrain) so I'm not too worried about the extras getting chewed on. However, I have only properly played the actual game once. I'm hoping to correct this as my kids get older, and I'm sure they'll be happy to help me do so.

**Would've been 33: Cosmic Frog**

One of the wildest (and prettiest) looking games I've ever played, but don't let looks deceive. This is a relatively simple game, and perhaps the closest thing to Smash Bros that exists in board game form. The idea of combining a brawler with a geospatial puzzle is incredibly unique and feels great, just like the aesthetic. I really want to play this one more.

**Would've been 30: Pax Renaissance: 2nd Edition**

I've enjoyed every Pax game I've played so far, and this was no exception. Massively brain-burning, with many decisions that cascade dramatically, and interesting end-game conditions, I see this becoming my second-favourite Pax with ease (I doubt anything will ever top Pamir 2e though).

**Would've been 25: Twilight Imperium: Fourth Edition**

To be fair, a single game of TI4 takes longer than numerous plays of most other games, but once is still only once, and I don't feel comfortable having it on the main list until I've experienced it as least one more time. However, that one play was an incredible experience from start to (9 hours later) finish. This is the definition of an ""event game"", and it knows it. Truly brilliant.

**Would've been 23: The Great Zimbabwe**

This has been consistently at the top of my ""want to play"" list since first trying it several months ago. A fascinating spatial puzzle unlike anything else I've played, it seems to be the type of game that takes literal years to master (if that is even possible). The way you effectively set your own victory threshold (low threshold if you pick weaker options, high threshold if you pick stronger ones) is absolutely genius and means that many different strategies are viable. Such a cool system that I wish more games would use.

**Would've been 21: War of the Ring: Second Edition**

I adore the Lord of the Rings, so no surprise that I massively enjoyed my play of this, and in fact immediately sought out all the expansions I could find afterwards. The theme shines through remarkably well, and it is filled with those ""eyes light up"" moments of recognition; however, it never relies on nostalgia and the game itself is fantastic. I could easily see this making my top 10, given enough plays.",My top 50 games as of 2022 (plus 10 honourable mentions),1,self.boardgames,zc406s,WoodForDays,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/zc406s/my_top_50_games_as_of_2022_plus_10_honourable/,1670140871

*(BGG geeklist is* [*here*](https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/306064/woodfordays-top-50-games-2022)*)*

**50 - Cascadia**

This is the perfect ""coffee table"" game for me and my wife. We'll often have a game of it going on the side while we blob out and watch a show or a movie in the evening. It's a delightful little game with interesting decisions delivered in bite-sized pieces, and the scoring cards give it a decent amount of replayability and variety. And Beth Sobel's art is, of course, an absolute joy.

**49 - Cosmic Encounter**

There was a time where I had this as my #1 game, and I was sure that would never change. It still holds a special place in my heart, and it still comes out now and then when we're in the mood for a pure fun, chaotic experience. Interestingly, I never bothered with the expansions; perhaps I should give them a try.

**48 - Viticulture**

Viticulture as a theme doesn't interest me at all, but I really do love this game. It pushes all the right buttons for me in terms of action efficiency, and the way it marries up order fulfilment with the aging of grapes/wine is brilliant. I consider the Tuscany expansion essential.

**47 - Dice Throne**

Pure asymmetrical battling fun in a box. Well, several large boxes; we have everything for this excluding Adventures (so Season 1 Rerolled, Season 2, and Marvel) and it's all fantastic. The heroes feel very different, the dice-chucking is satisfying, and the card-play is impactful. Not bad at all for what is essentially an evolution of Yahtzee!

**46 - Sleeping Gods**

This game really is all about the stories contained within it, and thankfully they're fantastic. That said, I also enjoy the maintenance and combat, and find the whole experience very compelling. Fun (or not-so-fun) bit of trivia: This game got me through a particularly nasty bout of COVID - good times! Very much looking forward to the next chapter in this adventure.

**45 - Android Netrunner**

I got into this in a big way many years ago, when it was still in print. I've been meaning to try out the new fan-made versions. There's really nothing quite like this in existence, it's a true masterpiece of two-player asymmetric game design. So many wonderful memories of making white-knuckled sweaty runs, praying that my opponent didn't have a trap waiting for me (even though they inevitably always did). If this was still in print and easily accessible, it would probably be higher on my list.

**44 - Blood Rage**

My favourite Eric Lang game, and one of the best drafting games ever made (not to mention minis-on-a-map and area control). The fact that it can be just as beneficial to win combat as it can be to lose is genius and adds a lot of intriguing tension. Such a fun experience every time. ABHDL (Always Be Hate-Drafting Loki).

**43 - The Age of Atlantis** 

A surprising newcomer to the list! I really wasn't expecting to enjoy this as much as I have, but it's an excellent game. The rulebook is a hot mess and desperately needs a re-write, but once you get past that there's a lot of good stuff going on here. Much like Scythe, mixing up the different player boards adds a lot of variety and dramatically changes the feel of the game. The morale mechanism alongside upgrading workers to Atlanteans forms an especially clever almost push-your-luck approach to worker placement. Plus the whole thing looks fantastic on the table. A few people have complained about the quality of the cards and the resource trackers but honestly I haven't found either of those things to be issues at all. 

**42 - Clans of Caledonia** 

Another one that used to be much higher on my list. Very similar to Terra Mystica and Gaia Project in a lot of ways, but ultimately feels different enough to be it's own thing. The market system is very clever and adds a good amount of additional interactivity, and the central point-scoring mechanism of order fulfilment works very well with the theme of the game. Always happy to play this one.

**41 - Argent: The Consortium**

Possibly the meanest worker placement game in existence. Different types of workers behaving differently is clever and interesting, and the end-game scoring being effectively a hidden goals system is extremely unique. Plus, there's an absolutely ridiculous amount of variability with all the different locations and cards. I adore this game and wish I had more people to play it with.

**40 - Mechs vs. Minions**

This was the first truly big-box, deluxe board game I ever owned, and it holds up to this day. Putting the gorgeous production aside, the gameplay is pure action programming fun. There's something so satisfying about trying to control the chaos of your mechs in the early game, and eventually becoming devastating minion stomping machines by the end - hopefully in time to complete the objective! The variety in missions is excellent, and it's bursting with great ideas executed well. Also, the secret box doesn't disappoint.

**39 - Dwellings of Eldervale**

My initial impressions were that this would be a ""candy game""; there's a lot of stuff going on that initially seems loosely connected at best, and it's all very vibrantly colourful and overproduced. However, it is a very solid game underneath all the bling, and I've had a ton of fun with it every time. The tempo of the game (placing workers out to do stuff, then eventually taking them back to do different stuff, rinse and repeat) is very satisfying and feels unique, and there's a lot of very strong player interaction for what is ultimately a rather thinky euro.

**38 - The Search for Planet X**

I've always enjoyed Cryptid, and consider it a genius work of design in how it uses only physical components to create a variable setup pure deduction game. The Search for Planet X is also a pure deduction game, but it requires an app, and despite my initial reservations because of that, it is the better game for it. My favourite pure deduction game by far, and one I'm always willing to play. The fact that it uses a rondel to simulate opportunity cost is just icing on the cake.

**37 - New Frontiers**

Puerto Rico was one of my favourite games for a long time, but it has a bunch of problems, such as its representation of ""colonists"" and the way seating order can significantly impact the outcome of a game. New Frontiers entirely replaces Puerto Rico for me, and it does so with a more interesting theme (for me) and more rigorous mechanisms. Yes, the resource cubes are way too big for what they are, and the box takes up way too much space, but it's such a good game that I can't hold either of those issues against it.

**36 - Crokinole**

By far my favourite dexterity game, and one of the best ""we don't know what else to play"" games out there. Incredibly easy to teach and play, but with a surprising amount of depth for what it is. We love crokinole so much that we actually have two boards for it (pro tip: if you need extra justification for buying a crokinole board, they make striking wall art). Some day we'll finally get around to hosting a tournament...

**35 - Scythe**

I remember desperately trying to source a copy of this back when it was hard to find in little ol' NZ, but nowadays it's everywhere! One of the two games I've bought a big-box wooden insert for (the other being Firefly; spoilers for later). Scythe is always a hit with every group I play it with, and is suitable for gamers of any experience level. There are always interesting decisions to make, but due to the simple action selection mechanism it never feels paralyzing. Doesn't hurt that it looks amazing on the table. Also, the Fenris expansion takes it to the next level in terms of the variety it adds.

**34 - 18Chesapeake**

In my opinion, this is the best entry-point to one of my favourite board game sub-genres, 18xx. I've taught it to multiple groups with great success, and virtually everyone has wanted more afterwards. The export system is a simple, clever way to keep the game moving in games where people aren't buying many trains, and the map is interesting and covers a wide variety of classic 18xx situations. Sure, it isn't as cutthroat or tightly balanced as some other titles, but it is perfect for what it is. The 3-hour playtime alone makes it worthwhile (there's no better way to turn people off a genre than mentioning that most of the options take 6-12 hours).

**33 - Gùgōng**

Something about the way this game combines hand management with worker placement really gets my gears turning. It's an immensely clever system. Then you add the various locations on the board that effectively work like minigames, while still feeling cohesive and interrelated, and it all comes together in a very satisfying package. It's so much fun to play, with a healthy mix of tactics and strategy to keep the brain burning. I haven't yet tried the expansion but it looks like it adds even more interesting and impactful options, so very much looking forward to it.

**32 - Reef Encounter**

The theme is very unusual and at times downright silly. The mechanisms are essentially a bizarre mixture of tile placement and stock-market manipulation. There's an element of hidden-but-trackable information which one could argue is poor design. On paper, I should hate this game, but it's incredible. Richard Breese is some kind of mad genius.

**31 - Race for the Galaxy**

Safe to say this is my favourite pure card game (if you ignore the point chits). There aren't many games that are more satisfying once you get going with that perfect point-scoring engine, only to realise at the end that you underestimated your opponent's military juggernaut and they've blown you out of the water by 20 points (ahem, that definitely doesn't happen to me anymore). Sure, the iconography isn't exactly pretty, but it is extremely functional and essentially disappears with enough plays. It's a rare thing when a game can take 20 minutes and yet feel like a completely satisfying experience. The only thing keeping me from playing it more often is a lack of opponents; perhaps I should try an online implementation.

**30 - Earth Reborn**

I got this in a math trade a number of years ago, and was blown away by how good this tactical skirmish game with a B-movie aesthetic really is. The barrier to entry is quite large, as it effectively requires you to play through numerous scenarios of escalating complexity to fully learn the game, but it is well worth it. There is so much depth here that it's almost absurd (seriously, check out [this rulebook **summary**](https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/64227/summarises-all-rules-pdf) \- sheesh), but it all comes together incredibly well and the theme shines through wonderfully. This is the game I most want to see remastered.

**29 - Firefly: The Game**

We own everything ever made (barring some rare promos and the big money), including a massive wooden crate to store it all in, and despite the nearly overwhelming amount of... stuff, it is an absolute treat every time we play. One of the best examples of thematic integration and fun-first gameplay out there. There's nothing quite like exploring the 'verse with a bunch of friends (and maybe stabbing them in the back while you're at it).

**28 - The Quacks of Quedlinburg**

This game, with all the expansions and the deluxified chips, is almost always the game of choice when we're trying to bring newbies into the hobby. It is immediately satisfying to pull those chips out of the bag, and the temptation to pull just. one. more. chip is delicious. Even better when you're watching someone else think about it, think some more, slowly reach into the bag... only to pull out the 3 Cherry Bomb and bust. It's always a raucous experience, even if the luck heavily outweighs the strategy. If you hate Quacks, you might hate fun... and that's okay! But I love it.

**27 - Great Western Trail**

On it's own, Great Western Trail is an excellent euro. With the Rails to the North expansion, it is a masterpiece. So many interlocking mechanisms and interesting decisions to make, in which buildings you place and where, to how far along the rondel you move at once, to how you construct your deck. Rails especially fixes some slight balance issues (e.g., it's almost always best to deliver to Kansas ASAP) and makes many different strategies much more viable. It's astonishing that a game primarily built around building a deck of cows is so much fun, but it really is.

**26 - Crisis**

This is a real underrated gem of a worker placement game that more people need to know about. It is a semi-cooperative game where you play as business leaders trying to make bank in a time of economic uncertainty. The fact that everyone is responsible for keeping the economy afloat works brilliantly to keep a sense of tension while not being overbearing. You really don't want to be left holding the bag when Axia collapses into turmoil. The way it simulates an economy with internal production vs importing is also excellent, and really drives the theme of the game home. Plus it's just good fun to build your engine of companies into a well-oiled resource-producing machine.

**25 - Trick Shot**

As a Canadian, I am legally obligated to enjoy anything and everything related to hockey. Despite all that, the reason I love this game so much is in fact because it is fantastic. By far my favourite sports board game implementation, the turn-to-turn luck pushing via the dice combined with the almost chess-like positional play, all masterfully woven into the theme, makes for a great experience every time. Artyom Nichipurov is quickly becoming one of my favourite designers, and I'm very much looking forward to the second edition.

**24 - Troyes**

It's pronounced ""twah"". Right, now that that's out of the way, I'm a big fan of Troyes. It's one of the meaner euro games out there, in that you can snatch dice away from other players that they were hoping to use. However, when you do this, they get money that they can then use to do the same in turn, so it never feels so mean as to be brutal, and it is more of an opportunistic mechanism than a back-stabby one. The semi-cooperative aspect of trying to defend the city from bad stuff is also done quite well. There's so much variety here and every game feels fresh and different with the wide variety of cards that completely change the game. My favourite euro involving dice as a central mechanism.

**23 - Townsfolk Tussle**

This was quite a big surprise for me. I was expecting an experience with wonderful art and a fun theme, but not much substance. The truth is that Townsfolk Tussle is a boss battler that, while relatively light, punches well above its weight. You'll fight through four random bosses through escalating levels of difficulty, with the first being relatively easy and the last being a real challenge. Between the battles, you'll experience random events and buy equipment. The bosses all feel very different, the items change the game up a lot, and all combined results in a different-feeling game filled with interesting decisions every time. Despite the long playtime, I'm always up to play through this one.

**22 - Everdell**

Everdell is my go-to game for introducing folks new to the board gaming hobby to slightly heavier fare, and it always works. The base game is a lot of fun and quite easy to teach, while encompassing a fairly wide range of common mechanisms. Working out and executing the optimal engine is very satisfying. Not to mention the wonderful table presence. However, it really comes to life when you add the expansions. Spirecrest in particular is fantastic, adding different incentives (and disincentives) to moving through the seasons, and more interesting scoring options. We have the (ridiculously huge) Complete Collection and haven't yet managed to play the two new expansions, but they look great as well.

**21 - Mage Knight**

This is a massive, intimidating puzzle in a box. It's a tough one to get to the table, even solo, because of how long it takes to setup, play, and teardown, but it is remarkable and a true masterpiece of adventure game design. It has one of the best implementations of multi-use cards, which is one of my favourite mechanisms (potential spoilers for the rest of my list), combined with a host of other brilliant aspects that all work together to become a gripping, fun experience every time. It does hurt my brain, though, and I can't help but feel like it might be even higher in my list I didn't feel like I need to relearn it every time I play.

**20 - Keyflower**

I love Keyflower, it does so many things so well and is always fun every time I play, and I often find myself daydreaming about it while playing other euros. There's also a bit of a nostalgic factor, as it's one of the earlier games in my collection that really stuck with me. One of my formative gaming memories was playing Keyflower 1v1 with my wife on the floor of our old apartment on a stormy winter day. Also, to this day I am convinced that bidding with workers is one of the cleverest combinations of mechanisms in games.

**19 - Tzolk'in: The Mayan Calendar**

The way Tzolk'in represents the passage of time by using massive gears that slowly turn is sublime. It is so much more than a physical gimmick. In my view, it is one of the finest examples of a game that, on paper, seems like it should be overly convoluted and contrived, yet feeling perfectly elegant and natural whenever it is played. The base game is excellent, but the Tribes &amp; Prophecies expansion cranks it up yet another notch and makes it one of my favourite games.

**18 - Age of Steam**

This is not a game I would play with just anyone, it requires a certain mindset to properly enjoy. It is incredibly mean, cutthroat, and an early misplay can destroy your whole game. It almost feels like a push-your-luck game, in that in order to beat tough competition, you often need to over-leverage yourself and dance on the edge of a knife. Quite possibly the tightest game I've ever played, with the highest highs in gaming coming from a strategy planned and executed successfully. It is phenomenal.

**17 - 1822: The Railways of Great Britain**

This glorious monstrosity of a euro cleverly disguised as an 18xx is my favourite ""event game"" (i.e., take the whole day off and order pizza). There's a ton going on, and if you play with people new to 18xx, they'll probably have a bad time, but once everyone knows what they're doing and the turns go by quickly, there aren't many experiences like it. I especially love the absolutely bonkers amount of bidding that takes place, leading to lots of interesting decisions and game states. And there are quite a few variants out there to give it legs if the base game ever wears out (hah, as if).

**16 - Le Havre**

A good storage/setup solution is essential for this one, but once that's sorted, it's one of the best tableau builders out there, with an incredible amount of variety in the cards and the order they come out in. Even the different order of the ship track can change the game feeling significantly. Not my favourite Uwe game (spoilers), but it is a delight nonetheless.

**15 - 1830: Railways &amp; Robber Barons**

My first, and favourite, 18xx. I adore everything about this game. From the opening auction of private companies, to the map layout and position of public companies, to the stock market, to the train count and pacing. The only reason I don't play it more in person is the long playtime, but I almost always have a game going online.

**14 - Gloomhaven**

The best dungeon-crawler ever, bar none. I've played this dozens of times and almost every game has been down to the wire, filled with some of my most memorable board gaming moments. The card play is pure genius. The sheer amount of content, all of it interesting and unique, is breath-taking. The only downside is the extensive setup/teardown time (even with the app) and the sometimes-unintuitive AI (although this quickly becomes a non-issue with enough plays). I'm very much looking forward to trying Jaws of the Lion some day, as it seems like it solves a lot of those issues.

**13 - Barrage**

A relative newcomer to the list. The idea of a game based around building dams and ""catching"" water to generate power didn't appeal to me at all, but I was hooked from the first time I tried it. The theme seems like it should be dry (something something water pun) but it flows (oops, there I go again) so well. I absolutely love the feeling when someone thinks they've thwarted my plans by grabbing a particular droplet, only to realise that they've opened up the floodgates (please stop) for a whole new, better option for me. Even the worker placement and the simple rondel for building feel so satisfying.

**12 - Agricola**

The first ""heavier"" game I ever played (compared to games like Catan and Dominion), and it has withstood the test of time. Despite the fact that my wife virtually always beats me, I still love this game and will play it with her any time. The potential for runaway combos of cards means that playing with a draft is really essential for people who know what they're doing, but it is one of those games where a draft adds more fun, rather than just friction, as it gives you more of an opportunity to deliberately try out different strategies. Also, we see Farmers of the Moore as mandatory (and amazing), but that may be just us.

**11 - Oath: Chronicles of Empire and Exile**

The first Cole Wehrle game on my list, but certainly not the last (spoilers), this is a glorious experience that is more about the memories you make than the moment-to-moment gameplay (although it is certainly no slouch in that area either). The fact that each game impacts the next is, quite simply, brilliant, and leads to some truly fantastic meta-gaming. King-making becomes a legitimate strategy, because if you know you're down-and-out in this particular outing, you can at least put yourself in the future Chancellor's good books and win some favour for the next one. If that sounds awful to you, I can't in good conscience recommend Oath to you, but if it sounds even remotely intriguing, I promise you: It's wonderful. An incredible achievement that accomplishes exactly what it sets out to, creating an overarching narrative that outlasts the time at the table.

**10 - A Feast for Odin**

My love for the worker placement genre goes back many years, starting with Uwe's classic Agricola, but none come close to matching this in my mind. Yes, it has a ludicrous amount of bits, but they all have their place. Yes, it has more placement locations than ten other games of the genre combined, but they are so brilliantly designed that it's never overwhelming. Yes, the geospatial puzzle only works with the Viking theme if you put on dark glasses and squint heavily, but any game that makes me say ""Oooooooh, beans!"" delightedly multiple times is clearly nailing it in the theme department. Add in the Norwegians expansion to trim the loose ends and you have a bona fide masterpiece.

**9 - Root**

Another Cole Wehrle title! Root was one of my earliest introductions to heavy asymmetry, which is an aspect of games that fascinates me to this day. The idea that everyone at the table could be playing what is effectively a completely different game, with strong interaction between factions, and every permutation thereof resulting in a unique experience? Mind-blowing. And the art really takes it to the next level. Root is a remarkable feat of game design while somehow being enormously fun to play, and it isn't even Cole's masterpiece (again, spoilers).

**8 - Ark Nova**

The rise of Ark Nova to the top of the board gaming charts has been meteoric, to say the least, but deservedly so. It doesn't do much that is truly unique or innovative, but rather blends existing mechanisms in such a perfect way that it feels like an entirely new thing. I am especially enamoured with just how lovingly the theme is captured; it really feels like you're grappling with running a zoo, trying to balance the need for ticket sales with the greater good of conservation. The use of the escalating action selection mechanism (borrowed from Through the Ages) is especially inspired, and ties the whole thing together into an incredibly satisfying experience.

**7 - Brass: Birmingham**

My favourite economic game, there is something so delightfully crunchy about Brass: Birmingham. The interaction is so exquisite and every decision so impactful. I especially love the fact that in the canal era, you're effectively vying for positioning in the rail era where the REAL points are scored, but how you want that positioning to shake out entirely depends on the market locations which differ from game-to-game, meaning that no two eras, let alone games, ever feel the same. The card play is also absolutely brilliant, and despite the dark aesthetic, it is gorgeous on the table. I still need to get my hands on some iron clays to really pull it all together.

**6 - High Frontier 4 All**

This is, by far, the most intimidating game I've ever played. It's jaw-dropping how accurately it simulates space exploration, and yet once learned it's pretty easy to remember how everything works. My preferred way to play, at least so far, is a friendly goal-based approach. Everyone picks goals that seem fun to accomplish (e.g., landing on Mars) and goes for them, not worrying about scoring. Perhaps after a couple dozen games, I'll want to get more competitive with it, but as it is it's such an entertaining and engrossing puzzle that I haven't felt the need. I'll never forget the first time I successfully landed on Mars.

**5 - Spirit Island**

By far my favourite one-and-done cooperative game, there is so much to love about Spirit Island (aka ""reverse Catan""). The spirits all feel wildly different to play as, the scenarios are rich and impactful, and even the power cards that come into play can change the game significantly. Especially when the numerous expansions are added in, there aren't many games that come close in terms of sheer replayability. Figuring out the puzzle is always a pleasant headscratcher, and if it ever isn't, just increase the difficulty! Finally, I love how it solves the alpha gamer issue by quite simply being too difficult to quarterback (or alternatively, by being excellent solo). If you're trying to manage what everyone else at the table is doing, you're probably failing miserably yourself.

**4 - The 7th Continent**

I am convinced that no other game pulls you into its world quite like 7th Continent. It is effectively an optimisation puzzle disguised as a choose-your-own-adventure novel in board (well, card) game form, and it is a masterstroke of genius in how well it pulls it off. My wife and I spent more than 20 hours solving the first curse (effectively a complete campaign) together, then at least another 50 hours across some of the other curses, and we loved every second of it. It can be punishing, so you need to know that going in, but with a few basic survival tips in mind (e.g., hunt often), it is just the right amount of difficult to make the experience that much more rewarding when you figure it out. There is a truly absurd amount of game even in the core box alone, and it gets ludicrous when you add in all the expansions on top. I'm not sure I'll ever see it all, but I'm sure going to try.

**3 - Pax Pamir: Second Edition**

Can you guess who my favourite designer is? Yup, it's Cole Wehrle by a mile. Pax Pamir 2e is an absolutely essential masterpiece that creates experiences at the table like no other. Despite its undeniable weight, everything makes intuitive sense, and the complexity leads to amazing, unforeseen plays. It's one of the games that I most often hear the words ""Oh, WELL done!"" said by someone at the table in response to a move (often a last-minute change of allegiances). It is also one of the most beautiful games ever made, with its unconventional components and strikingly thematic artwork, right down to the pattern on the inside of the box.

**2 - Gaia Project**

I have played Gaia Project dozens of times and every single time I love it more. There are so many things to think about before even picking (or bidding on, if everyone is experienced enough) a faction. The end-game scoring, the round scoring, the position of basic and advanced tech tiles, the position of planets on the board... It's an incredible puzzle every time, and the process of trying to solve it while jostling for position with the other players is one of the best experiences in board games. This game pushes all the right buttons for me and I am literally always willing to play it.

**1 - Guards of Atlantis II**

It's entirely possible you've never even heard of it, but Guards of Atlantis II is a masterpiece of game design. Anyone who knows me won't be surprised that it is, by far, my favourite game of all time. But don't take my word for it; I've played it now more than 20 times with more than 20 different people, and have never had it fall flat, and have had many others proclaim it their favourite as well. It is constantly requested, and we've even had multiple public holidays dedicated to playing it. The best way to describe it is a team game that plays from 2p to 10p (with a variant to support odd numbers), based on the MOBA video game genre where every player controls a different hero with completely unique abilities, and the goal is to either kill off the opposing heroes enough times, or help your team's NPC minions push forward into the opposing team's home base by killing the opposing team's minions. The gameplay is deceptively simple, with the decision space being mind-bogglingly deep. It's also exceptionally well-balanced despite having 22 VERY different heroes. The team aspect really makes it shine, resulting in some of the highest highs (and lowest lows) to be found in gaming. Nothing even comes close to touching this as my favourite game, and I suspect it will stay that way for a very, very long time.

\---

&gt;!Honourable mentions:!&lt;*(games that technically made the list when I ranked but I haven't played them enough to be sure)*

**Would've been 60:  Yellow &amp; Yangtze**

I enjoyed the predecessor, Tigris &amp; Euphrates, but never really fell in love with it like so many people do (that said, I still play the mobile implementation now and then). My single play of Yellow &amp; Yangtze was fantastic. It didn't have as many of the big game-shattering moments of T&amp;E, but seemed much... friendlier, somehow. And the progression/escalation throughout the game was very satisfying. Looking forward to playing it more.

**Would've been 52: Viscounts of the West Kingdom**

This is one of the most Vital Lacerda games I've played made by someone not named Vital Lacerda. I was very impressed, and thoroughly enjoyed it. All the mechanisms seem somewhat disparate at first, until you start to see how they all come together, and the card-play is extremely unique and satisfying. Strong potential to become my favourite Shem Phillips game.

**Would've been 47: Rising Sun**

I'm still not completely sure how I feel about this one, although truth be told it hasn't fully left my head since I played it. I'm convinced that it can't be well-balanced (even basic things like not everyone getting the same number of turns in a relatively turn-poor game), but the decision-space is extremely interesting and the politicking seems like it has a lot of potential for high-level play. Definitely keen to play it more, but not sure how well it'll hold up over time.

**Would've been 42: Glen More II: Chronicles**

This was immediately one of my favourite tile placement games, really blew me away. There are a lot of just plain fun things about this, from the rondel mechanism for determining the current player (think Patchwork), to the spatial puzzle when placing tiles and the way it massively escalates as you build up your little clan, to the sideboard and the little treats it provides throughout the game. The lavish production doesn't hurt either.

**Would've been 37: Heroscape**

I have played WITH Heroscape for many, many hours. The toy factor verges on ridiculous and building maps with the terrain in particular is perfect for kids (as long as you don't let them apply too much pressure to the water and swamp tiles - whoops). Plus, the pre-painted minis are great fun, and I have multiple duplicated sets (for terrain) so I'm not too worried about the extras getting chewed on. However, I have only properly played the actual game once. I'm hoping to correct this as my kids get older, and I'm sure they'll be happy to help me do so.

**Would've been 33: Cosmic Frog**

One of the wildest (and prettiest) looking games I've ever played, but don't let looks deceive. This is a relatively simple game, and perhaps the closest thing to Smash Bros that exists in board game form. The idea of combining a brawler with a geospatial puzzle is incredibly unique and feels great, just like the aesthetic. I really want to play this one more.

**Would've been 30: Pax Renaissance: 2nd Edition**

I've enjoyed every Pax game I've played so far, and this was no exception. Massively brain-burning, with many decisions that cascade dramatically, and interesting end-game conditions, I see this becoming my second-favourite Pax with ease (I doubt anything will ever top Pamir 2e though).

**Would've been 25: Twilight Imperium: Fourth Edition**

To be fair, a single game of TI4 takes longer than numerous plays of most other games, but once is still only once, and I don't feel comfortable having it on the main list until I've experienced it as least one more time. However, that one play was an incredible experience from start to (9 hours later) finish. This is the definition of an ""event game"", and it knows it. Truly brilliant.

**Would've been 23: The Great Zimbabwe**

This has been consistently at the top of my ""want to play"" list since first trying it several months ago. A fascinating spatial puzzle unlike anything else I've played, it seems to be the type of game that takes literal years to master (if that is even possible). The way you effectively set your own victory threshold (low threshold if you pick weaker options, high threshold if you pick stronger ones) is absolutely genius and means that many different strategies are viable. Such a cool system that I wish more games would use.

**Would've been 21: War of the Ring: Second Edition**

I adore the Lord of the Rings, so no surprise that I massively enjoyed my play of this, and in fact immediately sought out all the expansions I could find afterwards. The theme shines through remarkably well, and it is filled with those ""eyes light up"" moments of recognition; however, it never relies on nostalgia and the game itself is fantastic.

"It was a 4 player game, and we decided to tackle **A Time of War.**

**First Generation**  
I focused most of my time on gathering up the Knowledges I needed to be able to complete the Masterwork I drew (Immortality). Most of the village stuff involved listening to arguments about whether or not to support the Seperatists by building a Barracks. I'd gotten a secret conversation that somehow involved me getting a Scythe token, which didn't come into play until a fair bit later.

Eventually things come to a head in the Middle Years and we have to vote on whether or not the Barracks got built. We voted 3-1 in favour, so the barracks got built and the Later Years involved everyone sending someone off to get conscripted into the aforementioned barracks, and I'm sitting there occasionally glancing at the ""World Domination"" card and wondering if that was going to come into play.

Then the First Generation ended and everything turned to shit.

**Second Generation**  
The narration opens up with the next generation family members discovering that the village was gone because of the presence of the barracks. Like ""Turn to this page in the Village Chronicle and the whole thing is a blasted waste with no buildings"" gone.

Then we discovered the time machine.

And proceeded to go back in time to before it all started and to prevent the war from happening.

This played out with everyone getting an extra piece and keeping all of their completed experiments, but you had to redo all of the experiments you'd completed previously otherwise you'd keep some Paradox (which was probably bad, but we burned through all of ours so dunno what happens if you keep them). We also had to repair the time machine to prevent a paradox from happening - which we did pretty quickly - and also prevented the barracks from being built, which stopped the war from destroying the village.

I'd also gotten a hint about paradox being Bad when the scythe token came up and I met the person who made it - somehow blowing them up in a messy paradox event in the process. Still a bit hazy how that happened.

Then we met ourselves again - but older and from a different time with vastly different technology...

**Third Generation**  
... and we somehow ended up in an alternate future where science was so advanced that our original ideas seemed quaint. We had new resources to work with, new experiments to run (I invented 3D printing), and decided that the best way to get notoriety and acclaim was to Go Big on our Masterworks - which meant **Giant Immortality** for me (based on the picture on the card, I think it's about the scale of it).

So we're busily getting stuff done - I've gotten my last couple of pre-requisite bits and pieces done and was just at the stage of gathering the last two ingredients I needed - and then two of the other players decide during the Middle Generation that the time machine we used should be open source and free to everyone! And they just *released* it, because &lt;sarcasm&gt;people would *always* be responsible with such technology and *never* abuse it.&lt;/sarcasm&gt;

So we finish the Middle Years, and I only need some Gasoline (one of the new resources) to complete Giant Immortality...

... and during the change to the Later Years, the app *gleefully* informs us that the entire world has gone to shit, to the point where almost all life on Earth has been annihilated by all of the accumulated paradox. And we turn the Village Chronicle over to *another* blasted wasteland, with ""The Bunker"" as the only building there.

Cue me being salty because I was now cut off from getting any Gasoline, which meant I was the only player who was unable to complete their Masterwork. No **Giant Immortality** for me. Oh, and we ran into a bug on the app where ""The Bunker"" had a storybook icon (representing something extra we should've been able to do on the app) but the app didn't have an option that acknowledged it, so all we could do was pick up Animal, Chemical, or Gear from it.

I spent the last round doing A level experiments and filling up a couple more knowledge bits. Fortunately, one of the other players was able to complete his **Giant Time Machine** and stop everything from being destroyed a third time.

Also, I really want to know how the playtesters for this got it done in 3 hours, when we took 6.

**Overall verdict:** Enjoyed how this played out right up until the end when two of the other players unintentionally fucked the world. Definitely want to see how the other branches play out, and not just because I want to build the Tiger Launcher.",Played my second ever game of My Father's Work yesterday.,1,self.boardgames,zc14qd,Ametalia,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/zc14qd/played_my_second_ever_game_of_my_fathers_work/,1670130480

I am Harambo, I'm a passionate board game player. Every month, I compete on board game tournament in a FLGS in my town (usually they held gateway games tourney, e.g. Splendor, Catan, Azul, TtR). This time, I am going to compete in Gizmos Tournament on December 10th (next week). 

I am just starting to learn this game via youtube videos &amp; digital rulebook, then I will start to play the actual game with my friends at 8th &amp; 9th.

I am not entirely sure which pledge holds the most value, I suppose I will be content with the base game as it has the temple standees and the terrain expansion and runes simply add replacement for those.   


However I wonder what purpose do the big monument per realm hold and the settlement miniatures (""quickly discern which region has one"") could someone let me know how are region settlements discerned normally and if this pledge is worth it and if it improves gameplay/simplicity?

I'm starting as a game master in a group with 4 players, we're all beginners. We just completed Black Books' Chroniques Oubliées Fantasy initiation kit (sorry couldn't find the english title) in 3 sessions and we want to engage in a longer campaign. I saw that Black Books offers multiple guides for new campaign, however I find it lacks quite a lot of rules (how does time pass, how to use rations, enemies with no loot...) I tried to fill up by inventing some rules, but usually become unbalanced. 

So I'm writting this because I'm looking for a guide to run our first ""full"" campaign, I'm considering DnD because theres many guides written, big community, but I don't know many others... We're mostly into fantasy settings, and need a complete rule system, ideally with multiple pre written campaign so we can stay in the same system for some time. I was able to improvise a bit when it lacked some action but I don't feel like inventing a main story so soon.

"Have you ever played a game, found it incredibly punishing, and only later figured out you interpreted a rule or set-up step wrongly and the game was much more forgiving?

It happened to me with:

Carnegie:we missed that you start with five workers in the offices in addition to the five(or was it 6?) in the main hall, so we played 2 games with 5(6) starting workers instead of 10(11).
Reaching far out newly added offices was really time consuming and you often had to leave some office types very understaffed, to the point where you had to plan for your opponents just doing an action type where they had one meeple and other players had 0 to get ahead.
(One game with 4 players and 1 with 3 players, this one ended up with a 50-70 points first player score after the last 2 turns were just players activating their one person staffed office types other players left completely unmanned to gain some small bonuses)

Years of the dragon:we missed that the tile cards provided a base bonus that the characters enchanced, instead thinking that they gave 0+the number of symbols printed of the character tiles you had. Having half the tiles in a 12 moves game be a blank because you didn't have the associated character was sure  an experience.
(I think we ended with a max of 7 characters out and around 30-50 points, with one player only having 3 characters at the end due to building houses being so tricky)
Just 3 players luckily so the board wasn't too crowded

Vanuatu:we missed that the first player in turn order wins ties, leaving the first players very underpowered and a lot of turns where taking 2 succesful actions was seen as a big success,

When we got Quacks of Quedlinburg it was by miles the most complex game we had ever played (I know it’s not that complex now - but at the time for newbies it was) and once we grasped what was going on we loved it, played about 25 games of it over 2-3 months and we haven’t played it since, but strangely I have no idea why?! 

We enjoy it, we know it’s good, we have almost a 50/50 split between me and my mrs on who wins, but when we wanna play a game we basically always go to play something else.

I wondered if anyone else had a similar experience, and if it’s actually just that we don’t actually have anything against the game, we just prefer other games “more”?

"When I first saw this I was super into it -- I love CoB and it seems to address a lot of my issues, namely cardboard hex tiles that are either a nuisance to shuffle or get frayed edges in a bag, and tiny tiny illegible iconography.  Since the late pledge options have been up, however, I've been a lot more on the fence about it and I've been going back and forth for about a month now, unsure whether or not it's worth it.  

For starters, I don't know what pledge level to go for.  I want all acrylic, no miniatures and this seems to be a very difficult thing to achieve.  The reviews showed standees as player pieces, and I hate standees with a burning passion so I want to make sure I have the (admittedly controversial) busts.  So if I opt for the no-mini pledge, do I not get those? Even if I go for the lowest, no-mini pledge and add all the acrylic tiles, that's 195CAD _before 50$ of shipping_.  That's more than I've ever paid for any game, and I have some pretty big deluxe games.  It's a lot to ask, which leads me to my next uneasiness.

The people running the campaign seem to have no intention of fixing the problems addressed by backers and reviewers alike.  One of the most obvious issues is the fact that they got everyone's hopes up with  the instructions on the back of the hex tiles, but then for the most deluxe ones _removed this big upgrade_.  What?  This doesn't affect me _that_ much, but it's pretty weird to have a deluxe upgrade that is less functional than the base version, and then see them telling people they have no intention of making the upgrades better.  Apparently an extra bag for the goods has been something everyone has been begging for from the beginning of the campaign, yet they refuse to even offer them as an add-on for the many people who want them.  The box also comes at the same enormous size whether or not you get the minis, so if you want something more conservative it's just empty space. The whole thing just seems scattered and mismanaged

On top of all this, every version of the game comes with the cardboard tiles, so if you want the deluxe version with all acrylic, you just have to... _throw out_ like 5kg of cardboard?  Why was there no pledge level from the beginning for _just_ acrylic, when that's one of the primary appeals to this version?  They also say the acrylic hex tiles will fit the base box but don't explain how this works aside from ""if you remove the cardboard the acrylic ones fit"".  But the acrylic tiles are twice the volume, so either the cardboard versions have twice as much space, or half the acrylic tiles don't fit.  This is to say nothing of the fact that, even with the additional wasted space of the minis, the acrylic tokens don't fit the base box.  How was this something not accounted for?  I know the tokens are a newer addition, but how that wasn't something that was done alongside the acrylic tiles from the get go is beyond me.  All of these are small issues in general, but they add up and it's us, the consumer who is being asked to pay _big_ money, who are left dealing with the problems.  Problems we shouldn't have to deal with for such exorbitant costs.

Overall I'm just very on the fence.  I see how this is an upgrade, and I very much want it for that.  If none of these problems existed, I'd pledge.  If these problems existed and it costed half of what it does, I'd pledge.  But as it stands, the cost is astronomical and the quality control does not seem to match those costs.  I have a really hard time justifying that much money for something with this many flaws, but on the other hand I think a full acrylic version of CoB would be amazing to have.

How does everyone else feel?  If you backed it, what made you overlook the problems/cost?  If you chose to skip it, what didn't you like about it?",Where does everyone stand on the new Castles of Burgundy by Awaken Realms?,1,self.boardgames,zazjcy,Ronald_McGonagall,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/zazjcy/where_does_everyone_stand_on_the_new_castles_of/,1670019142

"I don't know if I'm missing something in the mindset one should have when playing a Legacy game and Gloomhaven in particular, but this game doesn't bring us joy.

Please be aware that I don't want to hate on Gloomhaven just for the sake of it, but I really don't get what's the appeal of the game given the situation we're stuck.

15 scenarios in and we realized that only one of us (4 players) would change the character.

My friend achieved his lifegoal and unlocked the character that was also on my life goal and we realized that I would be stuck with the Mindthief forever.
Another friend of mine, seeing that there could be the possibility that one could never change the character, checked the scenario book to see if his life goal could be met. He thought that the scenario he was due to complete was still to be unlocked progression-wise, but he realized that it was locked due to our choice in the storyline and so that he also wouldn't retire. ""Knowing that, I would have persuaded you to make the other choice""
The fourth player, almost sweating, said that given the situation he was 100% sure he won't change character either, but we refused to ask why for the sake of the legacy experience.


The storyline is difficult to follow and not very inspiring for us, we feel we're not really making an impact in the world of Gloomhaven and our choices are not linked to any moral value associated with our characters.
Choosing the next scenario or the outcome for a city/road event is just a rational decision to maximize our gains. Gains that we pursue for the curiosity of unlocking new content that, now it seems, it can't be unlocked unless we play with house rules. Road and City events in particular can be really predictable at times and it all boils down to good/bad choice in therms of buffs and debuffs. There wasn't a single event up to this point that rewarded us for being mean or taking an unethical choice. Stupid decision, even though they're funny, always lead to bad outcomes and nothing matters to the long run.


We were wondering if it's the case to adopt some house rules and change the characters but what's the point? By ""breaking"" the game we break the magic of the experience. Why can't we just spoil everything? What can the game give us, challenge aside, if we house rule the very reason we should progress in the first place?
We lack a raison d'etre as player and characters. 

TL;DR: we are unintrested in a storyline that moves forward with our character not playing any part by being replaceable and with us unable to replace them.
We are only left with the challenge of scenarios but we are wondering why we spent so much money for cardboards and minis that we will not touch, in an experience that relies upon mystery and hidden content that we should ""violate"" to have fun instead of watching one of us playing cool new heroes while we stuck with the first one forever.",I don't get Gloomhaven [Spoilers],1,self.boardgames,zaqfjq,Avispicio,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/zaqfjq/i_dont_get_gloomhaven_spoilers/,1669998321

A cardboard mat for an expansion (says it's for ""Common"" cards
A playmat (like a mouse mat, not the paper one)
All Bandits expansions
A full set of replacement moneybags and diamonds made of plastic.

The Rock Promo £12
Train Station Terrain Promo £10

Official Colt Express Playmat £30

Twinples £8



I'm a bit confused what to do. 

I originally bought this for the playmat (generally £50+ by itself) and the Twinples.

I already have the base game with my own 3D printed train (uses the original train pieces for the artwork).

I was planning on selling all the other bits, but seeing the expansions and everything, it's quite a nice set as is.
The base game barely gets over £15 on ebay and going from the original sellers prices, not sure it's worth selling.

Thinking perhaps keeping the game for 20+ years for my son to have his own copy when he's older.

Read the rules for the Delorean and the Stagecoach expansions but not sure I'd want to introduce them to my game.

I don't even know what the bandit cards do.

Is there anything else worth keeping from the set to enhance my own?

Should I keep the parts or just sell everything to recoup some of the cost (I didn't plan on buying this but think it was a really great price for the lot).

I have 5 extra badges for PAX Unplugged this Fri - Sun at Pennsylvania Convention Center in Philadelphia that are going to go to waste unless some board gamers use them.  If you are a poor college student, or a family that doesn't have an extra $300 to spend on conventions during an energy crisis these tickets are free with no strings attached.

I would only ask a few things:  
1) You will use them all 3 days.  If you are just going for a day, pay the $25.

2) Since they are in my company name, please don't do anything stupid.

3) You are vaxxed and you will wear a mask the entire time(Pax rules).

" I recently discovered Coup and fell in love with the game and the dynamics of bluffs and deductions.  


However,  after playing a few matches, I realized that the early game was very  similar, especially the famous ""everyone is the Duke"".  


Also, for  four players, the deduction decreases a lot, since there are 7 cards in  the court deck and even in the last turns we still have little  information.  


A variation that could work around both situations  would be, at the beginning of the game, show one or more cards  (depending on the number of players) and keep them out the court deck.  


3 players: shows 3 cards.  
4 players: shows 2 cards.  
5 players: show 1 card.  
6 players: show 1 card only if playing the Inquisitor.  


By doing this, right from the beginning of the game we have greater deduction capacity - even with few players.  


In addition, each game becomes different depending on the influences that are shown.  


For example, if a Duke comes up, the risk of bluffing increases and encourages players to adopt other strategies.

"So for some more context, my family has been wanting to dip their toes into d&amp;d. The things I am looking for in a board game for them are:

No dungeon master required

at least 5 players or more

game doesn’t run on for more than 4 hours. (something that can be played causally without session after session commitment with the same people. So pick up and play like pandemic other mysterium, etc…)

has different campaigns or stories to play (something with replay ability that can be a different experience each time)

I don’t care between how much or little character progression/character building there is.

I have looked at reviews for -descent legends of the dark -Dnd legend of drizzt/ ravenloft/ temple of elements -Betrayal at house on the hill And some others but it’s hard to tell from a lot of reviewers who are dnd focused reviews wether the game would be good for people with no dnd experience or not.

"My 8- and 10-year-old boys loved this game. Played 4 times in one sitting tonight, and I can tell they won't be getting sick of it anytime soon. Lots of replay value with the stickers, badges, and envelopes to open up.  It's difficult to find a game that my 10-year-old enjoys. He loses attention very quickly and prefers video games. So any game that keeps his attention gets an A in my book.  I'm also surprised at how challenging this game is. Not its rules - those are dead simple. It's just that I thought (when looking at video reviews for this game) that it must be super-easy to win. It isn't. We only won one out of the four games we played. Thankfully, the game was fun enough that even losses motivated the boys to try again until they won.

"Hey everyone, this is a follow up post from my [previous one](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/yl1mb9/board_games_advent_calendar_idea_for_my_husband/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) where I asked for advent calendar ideas to do for my husband, I have gathered some really good ideas and game suggestions from everyone (special thanks to veroxm) and was able to plan something out. So now that 1st of December is only hours away, I thought it would be fun to share here for people to partake in opening the daily doors.

So how this work is that I have picked out a total of 9 board games, each has a different play style and mechanic, and based on that I created a bunch of questions that you can answer. Each answer you choose will give points to its respective game, much like these personality quizzes. At the last day in the calendar (24th December) you can count your points and see which game you end up winning!

[You can take part here](https://calendar.myadvent.net/?id=0irw1g2yexsj9p5pv22f6ujq0y8neemb). In the calendar, you can open a 'door' per day starting on 1st of December, which can include either a question, a challenge, or a game. When you open a challenge, you will get the option to choose one of two rules that you can apply to a game of your choice. Game doors are just the days where I gift my husband a board game, and we get to play it for the first time for that day.

just as a disclaimer, since this is a personalised calendar that I made for my husband, all the questions are pretty lighthearted and probably not very strict/accurate, and the challenges are made to fit to the current games we own. So while I accept any constructive criticism on maybe how this could have been better, keep in mind also that this is not made to be factual, and just fun.

I will also be updating this post daily (UTC+1) to add the questions and challenges here :) I hope you guys enjoy this as much I do.

"Hi,  


My friends and I are  casual board game players. We play games like Catan and risk (I know there is a lot of risk hate). And I am the one who likes to go out and get a new board game and convince my friends to play something new.  


We have tried games like :

* wingspan (good game with wonderfull artwork), 
* 7 wonders duel (liked this one, but only 2 players), 
* Lost Ruins of Arnak (was alright but dont think we will play it a lot), 
* The Quacks of Quedlinburg (they liked the gamble aspect),  
* Hellapagos (made for some fun nights, we like the screwing each other over element) 
* Some coop games like pandamic (we liked the planning with each other and coming to the right strategy) 

and a couple more. But nothing seems to stick (except for partygames like codenames). So I'm hoping anyone has some suggestions for a board game to try out :). We like the strategic thinking and attacking/defending of risk and the resources gathering and making choices (like going for the road or building the most settlements) in catan. 

So I think what was missing in the games is that we can't really screw each other over or really play against each other (that's why risk is still popular in our group). I think risk takes way too long and is a bit boring to be honest. 

I have done some searching online and have found games like: 

* the crew, 
* Raiders of the North Sea, 
* inis, 
* kemet, 
* 1775: Rebellion, 
* 878 Vikings, 
* small worlds, 
* Cyclades. 

What is your favorite and what would you suggest? The game should be to difficult to understand. We are not playing for hours, just with some beers and have a good game session. We need to have the feeling of 'lets play another'.

"So my xmas plans are steering towards a xmas eve and first xmas day (25 december) by my lonesome (looking forward to it!!!). Having a small table, not every game is suitable, it's where most purchase wishes strand. My table is about 60cm by 100cm (29inch by 39inch of the top of my head).

Games I already own in order of playtime and enjoyment:

* Friday (play it almost every morning with a coup of tea and some breakfast)
* Under falling skies
* Welcome to ... The Moon
* Elder signs (with Unseen forces and Arkham gates and a few other extensions for some variation, was a compromise for Arkham Horror, which would border table space)
* Fallout: The Board Game (shared place with Elder Signs)
* Terraforming Mars: Ares Expedition (saw a game demo of Terraforming Mars, and that game wouldn't fit my table, so Ares was a compromise).
* Founders of Teotihuacan (as compromise for *Teotihuacan: City of Gods which wouldn't fit my table)*
* Countdown: Special ops (I'm Dutch, Dutch game designers. Not my favorite game, but sometimes fun to bring to the table)

I'm fairly new to this board game thing. I'm looking for a more involved game to keep me busy and entertained for a whole evening. 

Unfortunately game designers don't really publish game (recommended) dimensions on a table. It would be nice, just like having recommended hardware for videogames.

What are some nice games, with a nice table presence, nice game mechanics for a solo gamer, to fill up an evening. 

I like horror themes, SyFy, Historie, not a really big fan of Fantasy, Lord of the Rings type themes (but can overlook that for a nice game mechanic).

When a videogame first enters the Quality Assurance (QA) phase, many things can happen. Every game is different and unique in terms of programming, and this is the first challenge any QA team faces: the unpredictable nature of testing.

Here is how Testers find bugs, that a developer even can’t think of.

It’s not just playing a game the way it’s supposed to be, but it’s by trying to play the game in radical ways the programmers did not intend that issues and bugs start to show up, issues and bugs that, if left unattended, can ruin what would otherwise be a successful game.

"At first I was going to write this great grandiose post, but I'm not a creative writer so I figured a simple post might do justice for someone. With that being said, I wish someone introduced me to wargames when I first started playing boardgames as I could spend even more time diving into this hobby. Below I'm going to list my 5 favourite tabletop war games. All these games come in .PDF format and that is it.

You need to find your own terrain. You need to find your own miniatures. The cheapest way for all of these 5 games is to use regular household items (books, bottles, boxes) for terrain, and lego pieces, or even cut out circles representing bases for different units. $0 investment on this part.

**Grimdark Future by One Page Rules** - OPR (One Page Rules) is a behemoth. They have many games which are all FREE to download, the premium version has advanced rules. Grimdark Future is their replica of Warhammer 40K but faster, easier, and only has something like 18 pages of rules. You pretty much decide how many points each army will have (1v1, 2v1, 2v2, whatever), then you decide what army out of 24 armies you want to have. There are support people, medics, titans that are massive, etc.

Want to have massive robots? Or orks? Or Aliens with poison weapons? Maybe undead? Maybe you want Elite steam punk force? Maybe robotic ninjas? Girls with guns? You name it, they have thet army! And if there isn't an army that is available, you can re-skin with ease whatever miniatures you have. Don't like that? They even tell you how to make your own army! Power Rangers versus Marvel? 100% possible. 

Don't like Sci-Fi? They have a fantasy game. Don't like that? They have game based on war ships. Games based on Space ships. Do you have tons of green army men? They have a game for that. All 100% free. 

**Specre Operations** - A fairly new game. I think it came out in 2017? It's THE Swiss Army knife of modern wargames (modern = depends who you ask, but from year 1990 till now). It's a 28mm game, but can be played in 15mm. This isn't based on points, but based on scenarios. A scenario of you trying to capture the president? A scenario where you want to save a bank from being robbed? Hostages? Ticking time bombs? Barbed wire, K9, drones, gas, laser guns, knives, close combat. The rules never end. There are the basic rules which you can play, give your soldiers stats and battle eachother and there is stuff you can add which make it more complicated. One of my favourite moments was we played a scenario where soldiers need to help out a trapped soldier from a village held by rebels. Turns out the rebels were holding the hostage in their place of worship, but according to Geneva Convention you aren't allowed to fire at places of worship until they start firing. So they did. People started to run out and we tried to help them out. Turns out one of the people had IED and blew up with other people. Lots of twists and turns in this game with lots of reality.

**Chain of Command** - Made by a company called Too Fat Lardies. My favourite WW2 game. You control one side, they control the other side, armies are provided, go crazy! Maybe you have flamethrowers, maybe they have tons of tanks, maybe they have deadly infantry? Chain of Command has tons of expansions which you can download. The terrain for WW2 at 15mm looks absolutely stunning with trees, houses, rivers, animals, etc. My opponent was playing the Germans and was absolutely dominating me, and I waived the white flag before all my men died. I had to readjust my army, got more smoke bombs and did a lot better. Chain of Command has a really cool mechanic where there is Fog of War / Hidden Placement. Just like in war, you have no idea where the opponent is until there is a like of site. Sucha good game. Easy to understand. They also have a game where you can play at a much larger level (platoon) and instead of controlling 40 people, you are controlling 400 or 4000. A lot more to think about! Is there enough gas to get to? Is there enough ammo? How is the morale? When should you flank? Can you even flank? They also have games for Napoleonic times, medieval times, ww2 airplanes, etc.

"Hi all, I know, this question is the frequently asked  one here, bit I still would like to know from all of you.. 

So I have this potluck get- together coming up at a friend's house, where around 30-35 people will be gathering, including kids (hopefully 7 n up), teens, 30's, 40's and 50's (guessing at least 15-18 adults) .. and they DO NOT KNOW about adult board games.. (Some of them know some stuff we play with kids) 
These all people aren't my friends yet, only we know each other.. 

So my question is obviously, 
1. what game to play with them considering this type of mixed crowd? 
2. I was thinking of 2 rooms n a boom and herd mentality- but problem with both is that, not sure if they would like to sit and write the answers of silly questions,( though I like these type of games)
OR they will understand how to play 2RAB or not 
3. Is there any party game which works opposite of herd mentality? Where you win/ get points if you write some unique answers? 
4. Considering only adults - which I would like to ""convert"" 😉 into potential board gaming partners for my family.. I am not talking about forcing or coercing anyone... just I want them to get interested/ encouraged in playing more games in future 😊

"Today marks an emotional and personal milestone, and I want to share it with you ❤. After rediscovering modern board games little over a decade ago, I've been having ideas for games and tried making them into prototypes ever since. Some with more succes than others - just as it should be.

Then a few years ago now, a friend of mine took some leave from work, and wanted to devote his time time designing games, with the goal of having one published as the end result.

We came up with this idea of making ""modular polyominoes"", by drawing out different colored cubes from a bag, and placing them on a 3x3 grid. This could make shapes that were disconnected, so we discovered we've found a new and interesting way to make polyomino shapes, that was otherwise not possible. And that we could generate them in an absurd number of different shapes on the fly (the math says more than 1.9 million!).

[First prototype of the shaker](https://preview.redd.it/zq399ctulv2a1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4816d0e74b15f0e7fe0d4b2e30198e96d5507fca)

Not long after, we got the idea of automating that even further. We punched nine holes in a box, put in some cubes and shook it, lifted it, and there we had a perfect 3x3 randomly generated pattern of cubes. Later we updated it by adding a lid and an internal locking mechanism, so that you would no longer have to lift the box carefully to ensure no extra cubes was dropped. I'm quite proud of the end result. It works incredibly well:

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/ptpmrubxlv2a1.gif

Co-designer Kåre and I, we don't design games just for us. We both have the motivation of making games for as many people as possible. The return we hope for, is in the smiles and good times our games can bring to the world. The difference they can make in human relations, and being the social glue that takes a good time and turns it into a great time. This is what drives us.

*(Board games have, for me personally, been a HUGE factor in my social life - it has been the basis of most of it my entire adult life, and I don't know where I would have been without it. So it's very close to my heart to give back too the community.)*

It's too soon yet to say if, or how well or not, we have succeeded in that, but we will soon have some indication, as today is the day our game, Shake That City, will be live on the crowdfunding site Kickstarter. 

I would like to ask you: how do you perceive this device? Is it something that you find interesting enough to check out the game? I would love to hear your reactions, honest, good or bad.

Also, if you are into game design or just curious, you can read our design diary, where we share the entire process from idea to pitch to difficult design choices - all the way up to where we are today. I hope it might inspire any aspiring game designers out there too. Go make the next awesome thing!

"I would like to organize an irl clue game in which the players would be divided in parties of 3 people (?).

The invitation will state something like: each party has to discover the place of the next murder of a killer X and if they do before the deadline, they can challenge killer X in order to stop them with a final game.

But instead of a final game, I thought that I could gather the parties and ask them who is the culprit because X is  among them (I would give them some  clues), but I don't know how to make the ""traitor"" not to be an handicap for the party and how to make the X understand that they are the killer... 
And if they do, what should I advise them to do? If I were in their shoes I would sabotage my party but that would be annoying...

I got a few of my friends into board games and then like many we really started getting into it when I picked up Gloomhaven. Since then I got a 3d printer to make the minis and terrain. Then as I think most people in this hobby do we started dreaming about our ideal table. We looked at buying a table but they are all very expensive and not exactly what we wanted. So we admittedly stole the design choices we liked from different tables and got to work. We started with some plans that we bought on Etsy but after about 5 hours of trying to change them and make it work with our ideas we ended up scraping them and designed it ourselves. Luckily one of us is an engineer and could do some quick sketches. It's not perfect and we took a bunch of notes and had a small pile of scraps from us not knowing what we were doing exactly.

"I’m having a dilemma whether to invest into buying Mage Knight. It is a chunk of money, and a lot of time to learn this complex game, but it’s looks like a lot of fun to play.

I’m only playing with my wife one long session ( 7-10 hours ) a week. She’s not as competitive as me, but we found it very enjoyable playing co-op games and I heard that Mage Knight makes it for very good co-op.

The thing is - we own Spirit Island with all expansions and it’s been an absolute blast for past year that we played it regularly, but the “problem” is that we still love playing it every week.

My question is then - should I buy a new game and invest a lot of time to learn the complex rules, or should I stick with the old one that we still enjoy? Or is it better to play a game until you get bored of it before buying a new one?

"Even for tic-tac-toe, you need some kind of writing implement. But some games require no components at all other than the players participating. 20 Questions is the most evident example, and you can add in werewolf/mafia if you have the right mix of players. I Spy might count. What are some other examples? Here are two I know of:

**No More Jockeys** (c/o Alex Horne): Players take turns naming a person (any person) and describing a category they fall into. E.g. ""Alex Horne, no more comedians"". The next player can name anyone other than a comedian. And so on. The rules are cumulative, so the list of candidates gradually gets smaller. Play continues until someone breaks a rule.

**Contact:** One player is GM and comes up with a word the others need to guess. The GM provides the other players with the first letter of that word. Players can then guess the word indirectly but without saying the actual word aloud. E.g., for a letter A round: ""Is it a red fruit?"" The GM can then respond with ""No, it's not an Apple."" If the GM cannot figure out what the person was asking, but another game participant does, they can say ""contact"". They then make eye contact with the person who gave the clue and on the count of 3 both say it. If they say the same word, the GM must give the next letter of the secret word (eg ""Ap"". And so on. Whoever guesses the secret word becomes the GM for the next round.

We've found, however, that most games that you *can* play with two people, but that are designed for more, seem like they aren't as fun or have issues when played with two people. We typically end up changing win conditions or modifying elements to make games fit better for two people. 

I also do like the flexibility of a game that's fun for two, but could also be fun if we had friends over, so most of our games aren't designed *just* for two.

When I search on Youtube, for ""games for couples"" or ""games for two players,"" all I can find are ""Top 10"" videos that mention a few games I already have and don't get too in-depth.

I'm looking for more than just a brief recommendation or a paragraph or two write-up -- I want in-depth reviews, suggestions, modifications, ""how to play,"" maybe even walkthroughs, strategies, etc. specifically around the two-player experience for *each* game.

Are there any channels that do this, or are there any good board game review channels that have either a playlist or somehow make it easy to find their two-player reviews?

Apologies if this is not the right way to make this request, or if I should ask it in the 2P Tuesday thread (new to the sub).",Is there a YouTube channel that specifically reviews board games for two (couples)?,2,self.boardgames,z74t7x,anne433,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/z74t7x/is_there_a_youtube_channel_that_specifically/,1669661525
"So I have been kicking around this idea ever since I saw it kind of being done on the Beasts of War YouTube channel a while ago, but the idea is to use multiple game rulesets to facilitate a potentially larger type of campaign for the players.

In their example, I believe they were using pieces and rules from a couple of games to play FFG's X-Wing with ground units being involved in some way.

My idea would be similar, however, it would involve using a pen-and-paper ruleset and an associated strategy game to make the characters and decisions a little more impactful or meaningful while increasing engagement and interest.

The idea was to use the Age of Rebellion pen-and-paper rules or Edge of the Galaxy rules and some of the X-wing miniatures and rules.  The campaign would involve the players eventually having to engage in space combat, but instead of handling that with the pen and paper rules, giving the players the ability to play X-Wing to determine the outcome of their ""mission"".

I am just curious if anyone else has done this or something similar and if there are any examples out there that I could read up on to see how those GMs brought their ideas to light.",Multi-Game Ruleset Campaign,1,self.boardgames,z74qjy,drwiki0074,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/z74qjy/multigame_ruleset_campaign/,1669661359

"Hi!   


I'm looking for some friends to play some board/card/party games with and maybe to join my community's monthly game night if we mesh!  


I'm looking for people who are very nice and friendly, completely 10000% LBGTQIA+ friendly, who treat others with respect and courtesy! My community group is awesome and I would love to introduce other awesome people to them if we enjoy playing together.  


Requirements for playing together:

* Tabletop Simulator
* Board Games Arena account (Free)
* Discord
* Mic with decent quality  


Bonus points if you have a cam and are willing to hang out on cam with me when we play. The reason I ask this is because I have audio processing disorder and I have a hard time understanding people when I can't see their faces. It's not 100% required for board/card/party games like it is when I play TTRPGs but, if you're down to hang on vidchat instead of just voice, that's extra awesome.  


If you're interested please comment here before sending a chat request so I can send you my Discord tag!

"Tension: it’s what makes a game engaging and exciting. We all know what it feels like: you’re closing in on the objective, but trouble is coming… With each passing you feel the increasing thrill of potential victory, but also the growing anxiety as trouble looms ever larger… You’re neck and neck with disaster, flirting with failure, and running headlong towards a photo finish. It is, in a word, exhilarating.

My theory is that tension has two components: investment, and uncertainty. 

First, something needs to be on the line. You need to care. You need to have something *invested* This could be a variety of things: money if you are gambling, opportunity if playing in a tournament, a character and world you care about in TTRPGs. In (most) board games, the investment is *time* and *effort*. In each play-through, the harder you try and the longer you play, the more your investment grows. At the start of each game, investment is low: you’ve not yet put in time and effort. 

Second, uncertainty. Uncertainty is different than just probability. It is how likely (and how widely) the odds are to change. Even this, though, isn’t enough. The uncertain must be *malleable*. You need to be able to grasp it, bend it, change it.  Your actions need to have an impact on your odds, and the potential at least to make a favorable outcome more certain.

Taken together, these two elements create tension and, over the course of a game, the level of tension creates an arc. It rises and falls, sometimes multiple times in a single game. In the most exciting play-throughs, those that have you on the edge of your seat, the game ends at or near the highest peak of tension. But not every play-through, even  of the best games will produce this perfect arc. Perhaps it peaks a bit too soon, or perhaps it would have been more exciting if the game lasted a few rounds longer. Even though there are variations, a game will usually produce similar tension arcs. Over enough play-throughs, a kind of meta-shape emerges: a generalized form of how any given play-through is *likey* to feel from moment to moment. 


Which brings me to Horrified. 

The theme is fantastic, and the gameplay fits. The board is gorgeous, the components are high quality. Even the rulebook is meticulously designed and printed on quality paper. The mechanics are satisfying. The decision space feels robust. Each action feels important. You can make a plan, but must always be ready to change it. It’s quick to teach, but there’s enough complexity to keep experienced gamers alert.

But the shape of the game is just… off. In every play-through I had, the tension peaked around the middle of the game, and tapered off continually after. By the last quarter of every game, the game was over, but the ending hadn’t happened yet. Sometimes we won. Sometimes we lost. We never got our photo finish. We sometimes considered leaving the stadium early to beat the traffic.

We liked Horrified. We played it a dozen times. We ramped up the difficulty, increasing both the number of characters and the number of monsters. We’re glad we played it, and we were happy to give it away. 

This is not a negative review. Horrified is a *good* game. But it’s *nearly* a great game.",Horrified: a nearly exciting game,1,self.boardgames,z6ylu9,Serawberry,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/z6ylu9/horrified_a_nearly_exciting_game/,1669647322

"SPOILERS!! 

I’m playing the game solo and basically when you figure out the end game, you add numbers corresponding with what you think is the suspect, weapon and motive. 

I unfortunately didn’t get to question a certain Father John really in my run through of this case, I focused on the other three suspects. I got most of the story right however missed one main part and then it was time to make my final guess before I knew it. 

Carter hit the victim once and ran, I knew Christmas went back to the house and then the body became unrecognisable, I took that as he continued to use the bat further because of his anger against the victim. I got to the final guess day and so made my guess. 

Suspect - Damien Christmas - 74 
Weapon - K (the truncheon) - 210 
Motive - Revenge - 275 

(In hindsight revenge doesn’t really fit however I was thinking in terms of Caravaggio stealing the desired position from Damien, sex/jealousy didn’t fit it to me because it seems that option is only for relationships?) 

599, read the epilogue and huh?? I didn’t get it right at all! The only combination of items in the chisel book for this case that worked were: 

Suspect - Father John - 284
Weapon - Bust of St. Christina - 190
Motive - Mental Instability - 125

"TL/DR
My 5 year old beat me playing the adult version today. Should I return the kids version we got him for Xmas? 


We have been playing ticket to ride a bunch this long holiday weekend. This afternoon my 5 year old just legitimately beat me at the full version of Ticket To Ride, not the kids edition. The only help I gave him was helping him pick which routes to choose by showing him where they were. Something I’ve had to do for my wife and 9 year old as well. We also have a house rule allowing for one trade between players per turn which I did do, but only when it benefited me as well. We bought him the kids edition for Xmas because he has been asking for it, but I feel like he can do this one just fine. Should we still go ahead and give him the kids version, or just assume he can play this one just fine. The only reason I see to give the kids version is that we all actually love the kids version of Catan.",My 5 year old beat me at Ticket To Ride…,1,self.boardgames,z6mts9,Alaninabox,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/z6mts9/my_5_year_old_beat_me_at_ticket_to_ride/,1669610070

"During the pandemic, when our game group first moved online to do things, we played a lot of party games that could accommodate a large number of players.  We also did some trivia stuff.  One of the trivia things I did that everyone seemed to enjoy was creating a 20 question visual quiz on to identify game pieces.  
Seeing as how lots of people like the posts asking for help identifying a stray piece they found under their antique credenza , I figured I'd share it here as well.  I'll post 4 more groups of 4 over the next week or two.  I'll try and link back to the other ones, and I'll include answers in here under spoiler tags.

"Hey guys last night I had a fun game of Arkham Horror, which started very poorly as we tried figuring the game out haha, some questions came up that I am curious about. 

We played the Shots in the Dark scenario. Now I assume the codex starts with card 1, and then proceeds with each card that is listed on the scenario card. They all fall into effect at the same time, and as you meet requirements thats what dictates which card comes next? You dont actually use every single codex card do you? 

When it comes to headline cards that cause rumour effects, how exactly do these work? 

When a character earns an item, say a curio item, or a common item, or an item value at 4 or above, can they choose any from the deck? Or is it just a completely random choice? 

Something else we had issues with was event cards and monster cards. When a clue card is used, does it go back into the event discard pile and then when the event card pile is empty you shuffle all discarded event cards and put them back into the holder for continued use? Same with monsters, when all are exhausted, reshuffle and reuse? 

What exactly is the point of putting damage and health tokens on the scenario card in this particular scenario? 

Can you put wounds and sanity damage onto items? If so does that get rid of them?

Ideally what I’m looking for would be an adventure or an RPG, that can be played by two players only (possibly where both of us are “protagonists” of the adventure?) and it should be preferably easy(ish) to pick up.

Something like D&amp;D, not necessarily with a fantasy setting, but without all the complexity, knowledge and battle system required by that game is probably what we are looking for. We are fine with some complexity but not too much (it becomes tiring and off-putting).

* Missing games are normally not intentionally left off the list. It is very difficult to keep track of all upcoming games as information is scattered and release dates are often changing. Feel free to mention them in the comments 🙂
* I also provide a weekly video version of this post covering all the games in more detail + weekly pledge give-aways for viewers 💁‍♂️ Definitely check it out!
* If you are a publisher with an upcoming game, feel free to [Submit Your Game Here](https://www.shelfclutter.com/)

"Last week I played a game of Puerto Rico with a friend &amp; his son. They have had the game for a while and played at least 10 times.

During the game there were some funky rules that I didn’t believe were right, so coming home I googled the rulebook PDF and found various major mistakes in how we played + lots of details we got wrong (10+).

Today we played again, following the rules. I felt we played a much cleaner &amp; organized game. However, they argued it made the game a lot slower (learning curve) and that how they played before worked fine.

Now I’m doubting myself - am I taking rulebooks too literally or are they playing too loose? How do you play?

Ps. for those that know the game, these are some of the rules we got wrong the first play:

- No indigo/corn plantations placed during setup
- No money on unused role cards
- Number of colonists in the ship not determined by the open slots on buildings (always just by # of players)
- If trading house was not full, they would still empty it
- They got everything about the captain action wrong (everything)",How strictly do you follow the rulebook?,1,self.boardgames,z67s62,LucoftheGarden,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/z67s62/how_strictly_do_you_follow_the_rulebook/,1669571840

"Forgive me if this is wrong spot, but I recently bought 10 new games on a whim as a bundle from auction site, among them was ""herbaceous"". Beautiful game with sleek design, but the rules tripped me up a little.

It says players may take any ""set"" from community garden for potting.  Does this mean multiple herbs of different types as long as you pot all of them that turn? For example I have sage, thyme, lavender in my private garden and there's 2 sage, three thyme, 5 lavender and 2 mint... Could I take all the cards in the middle and then score two sage two thyme two lavender and 2 mint in one pot, and then pot the other individual plants in a different pot and score those as well. Or can you only pot herbs in one pot per turn?

The game seems cute just super simple our first play through and I think we mucked up the rules. 
Thanks for any clarification!",Question about herbaceous,1,self.boardgames,z62bjl,superwhitemexican,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/z62bjl/question_about_herbaceous/,1669558710

##FAQ

**I live in Bahamas/Canada/Venezuela/USA, why are you posting on a Saturday?!**

Because I'm writing this from Europe in the future where it's already Sunday. Timezones be crazy.

**Why are there a bunch of non-board games in the board game list?**

Because the Tabletop games category on Kickstarter includes anything remotely related to board games and sometimes things slip through my filters.

**Why is this future award winning board game and literal saviour of humanity missing from your list?**

Sometimes my filters get a bit overzealous and discard actually valid projects. If you feel something is missing for this reason, leave a comment and I'll add it (maybe).

**Can I donate all my money to you?**

No

**Can you help me promote my game?**

Please no. I make lists. Nothing more.

**Your list is full of errors and now my computer is making a weird noise!**

Indeed, this fine piece of code runs purely on hope and dreams, so anything can happen. Leave a comment and I'll see what I can do.

"Hello, sorry if this has been answered before but I’ve scoured old posts and can’t seem to find it. 

My friends and I attempted to play this last night. I know the game is notorious for flimsy rules and requires a lot of in house agreements to work, but I’m absolutely baffled by one particular thing. 

I ended up triggering haunt #3 The Dust (I think).  This wasn’t like the other haunts where the traitor leaves the room with the traitor tome etc. The traitor was a hidden/secret traitor drawn at random using a sickness tile. 

So I drew the sickness tile and became the hidden traitor. My goal was to swap the sickness tile with the next player and infect the rest of the group. The next traitor had to trade the sickness tile and infect the next person etc, and the traitor side wins when they’ve infected the whole group. 

But we were specifically told in the rules to never reveal our tiles meaning the sickness tile was being traded in secret. So how would I know when everybody had been infected? Obviously I could just wait for the sickness tile to make it back to me (we were trading to the left) but doesn’t that mean I could have won an hour before I got the tile back?

Honestly I’ve been thinking about it all night and I just can’t figure it out!",Betrayal at House on the Hill,1,self.boardgames,z5xm1u,Ldevine01086,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/z5xm1u/betrayal_at_house_on_the_hill/,1669543902

"I played the game with the base game plus the wonder box upgrades from the Kickstarter as well as the Pharaoh expansion as I heard this is required to really get the full experience. We played the game with 3 people.  

\- Big fan of Rising Sun and a lot of this felt similar in some regards so the game was an early hit for the table.

\- The game looked great (caveat to this is the map itself looks a little bland.)

\- The Pharaoh expansion is absolutely required in my opinion to get the full experience. Without it the game would have been lacking something.

\- The god merging mechanic is an atrocity and ruined the entire experience of the game which up until that point I would rate an 8/10. After finishing the game the whole god merge mechanic its at best a 4/10 in my opinion. 

\- To add to this I was 2 devotion (think of it like victory points) behind the person in the lead while the 3rd player was about 10 behind me. That mechanic basically wipes the lowest player out giving the 2cnd lowest player their power and they split the 2 actions into 1 each. It does open up possibilities but its probable my least favorite mechanic in a game I've ever played. I hated the mechanic so much I almost wanted to stop playing because dropping by that much devotion really sucked and was super disheartening to the lower player. In the end it was a slaughter of the non merged player and it just seemed like too many things that just weren't fun happened on both the people that merged and the non merged player.

The game overall I give a 5/10. Without that merge mechanic I was thinking it was a solid 8.

"I did it. I successfully repaired one of the two Dark Tower games I have. The one I repaired had both a faulty keypad and a ""bad"" motor.

I first started with the motor since that is pretty easy for me to repair. I work on model trains, so DC motors aren't foreign to me.

I took the back of the can off cleaned the contacts and the commutator pads, reassembled, put a drop of light oil on the spindle and it came back to life. Total time was 30 minutes.

The hard part was the keypad. I bought the Adafruit keypad, cut it down, and also removed the lip from the keypad plastic holder. I then removed the original ribbon connector on the circuit board and direct wired the Adafruit connector to the board. I'm going to find a better solution with the next board since it also has a bad keypad. I might possibly ream the holes a bit since they're not tinned and use jumper wire headers and jumper wires to connect them together. We'll see.

The last thing I needed to do was to print out and laminate a new label. I didn't like the scan I got, so I designed my own in Paint Shop Pro. If anyone is interested in a JPG of my reworked label, PM me.

"So hanging out in Reddit, discords, and YouTube I very often see people make game play comments which sound legit until something reveals that they're just bad at the game and I can't take them seriously anymore. An example being an argument I had with someone who thought that **Calico** was all randomness when in reality they've never scored above 40. I've never scored below 50 in that game and most of the time I score in the 60s, which shows that despite the random draw of the tiles you can reliably reach a certain score and if you're not there yet you're in no position to complain about randomness in the game. 

And another video from a reviewer I watched a few days ago claiming that in **Barrage** you can win without a single production (there are 28 income points on the board in Italy &amp; Germany, even if you unlock all of them by round 3, which isn't possible without production, that's still probably &lt;100pts which is far from a winning score against good players) or that a single wrong move and you're completely wrecked when the entire point of playing well is to guarantee that you're not left out of options.

I think of concepts like gameplay depth, design, and decision space as something that can be quite technical and hearing people make comments about these that are obviously wrong is like listening to a flat-Earther, especially when it comes from reviewers or people with influence in the industry because you'd think they'd do their due diligence /rant.",Do you take gameplay comments seriously when it comes from someone who's likely just bad at the game?,1,self.boardgames,z5gbjf,cyan_ogen,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/z5gbjf/do_you_take_gameplay_comments_seriously_when_it/,1669492581

I want to introduce him to modern games (and get a nice xmas present) and I am wondering what the best 'capitalism like monopoly but better' games would be. 

In my top list would be Chinatown and Lords of Vegas but I can't find any anywhere.

"hi everyone.

a few days ago we (3 people) played a few rounds of this game and haunt 44 happened. while reading the books for heroes/traitor we came across some ""problems"". after this round we start to discuss them.

!!we are playing the german version so i want to say sorry if i dont know the correct wording and room names!!

=&gt; first the question: the heroes have a special rule for this haunt which states that they are allowed to move from the ""starting room in the cellar"" (the room where you land if you end your turn in the laundry chute-room) to the ""stairs leading in the first floor"". so the same rule as the monster. the traitor dont have this special rule. so the heroes can escape the cellar immediately through this room while the traitor is forced to find the cellar stairs to get up? isnt this just unfair?

=&gt; this question leads to a theory we came up to ""exploit"" this haunt and trap the traitor forever in the cellar. here we go:

\- atleast one hero and the traitor are in the cellar and the stairs leading to the entrance are already dicovered (by the hero)

\- this hero set fire to the stairs and since the rules says that burning rooms dont have their special ""abilities"" anymore, the only exit from the cellar is through the starting room.

\- and since only the heroes (and monster) are allowed to move to the ""stairs leading to the first floor"" from the ""starting room in the cellar"" the traitor is now forever trapped in the cellar with no way (except maybe the map) to escape.

now the heroes have all the time to burn the house down and only need to take care of the additional monsters.

&amp;#x200B;

=&gt; another question: this special rule for the heroes indicates that even in the non-hauntphae the players are allowed to move between the ""starting room in the cellar"" and the ""stairs leading to the first floor"". a translation from the rule is:

*You can* ***still*** *walk between the basement shaft (starting room in the cellar) and the stairs on the ground floor (stairs leading to the first floor)......*

im confused since the rules never mentioned this movement for the playersor the heroes/traitors. only monster are allowed to do this. follow up: does the traitor counts as monster?

&amp;#x200B;

i hope i have explained my questions/problems as clear as possible. if not feel free tpo ask and i try to explain it.

"Hi,

I'm making a bit of a last ditch effort to find a game that I used to play with a friend as a kid. Each player had a plastic mouse that they moved around the board. The board was square and had several pieces of cheese on each side. If you landed on a square with cheese the mouse hooked into the piece of cheese and you pulled on it. I think the point of the game was to avoid the cheese that triggered your mouse being caught in some way. The only other information I can give is that I would have played this game sometime between 2002 and 2007 as that’s when I spent the most time at this friend's house.

I appreciate any help, but I also understand that this is probably a very niche game.","Help me find a game, please",1,self.boardgames,z562kk,AshahGrady,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/z562kk/help_me_find_a_game_please/,1669464559
"I’ve personally never bought a board game that wasn’t recommended by a friend or an in-person impulse purchase. Now I’m part of a small team, launching a board game in early 2023.

I just bought and began my first playthrough of The King's Dilemma. We're on our 4th generation now and absolutely loving it.

As this is my first legacy game that involves permanent physical alterations (i.e. using stickers, writing on cards) I'm uncertain about what I can do with the game after we're done our campaign. You can easily sign names over previous ones but since most of the stickers are placed, they can't be recovered and the game can't reasonably be replayed.

I buy and sell used games all the time but this one can't be replayed and therefore resold. Does it just become recycling material now? Hoping to get some ideas from people who have finished their campaign.

"Hi guys. I will soon be buying an FDM printer. I chose FDM because I live in an apartment and do not have space  for a resin printer, the post processing equipment required or the desire to deal with the toxic fumes/mess/waste that goes with it. I did lots of research and video watching, know all of the differences between FMD and Resin, and am comfortable with that decision (I am just putting that out there to fend off the ""should have bought resin for amazingly detailed minis posts"".

So, I am looking at buying a slightly larger than average FDM printer with a build volume of  320 x 320 x 400 mm, which is larger than the majority of board game boxes, meaning I could print lots of cool inserts and organizers for my games in one big piece. In addition  I would print card holders, cool custom dice as well as minis for some of my games which do not need to be super detailed, just respectable and functional.  I will also likely print things to sell to people in my local board gaming community.

**So, in addition to the above is there anything cool that you guys print that I should consider? Or do you have any good examples of stuff (preferable with photo) you printed with an FDM printer?**

"Decades ago, I played a children's game with two sets of coloured marbles in a tall, blue, two-sided tower contraption with white gears inset. Players sat on opposite sides of the tower and took turns rotating the gears. As a gear rotated, little hollows in the gears would allow a single marble to drop into the gear and be rotated along with it and eventually out to slide down a new track in the tower. The goal was to get all of your marbles to the bottom through the various gears. However, whenever you turned one of the gears favourably for yourself, you were simultaneously affecting the same gear on the mirror opposite side of the board for the other player, sometimes in a way that helped them, but hopefully in a way that did not.

I have opted into a scheme at work in which you can buy a gift for a less fortunate child that might not otherwise get a gift at Christmas.
The information I have been given is that it's a 10 year old boy that likes board games. That's all the information that I have.

-I'd like to maybe get 3, so smaller games are desired. 
-I'd like them to be easy to learn/light on rules as for all I know, ""board games"" could mean monopoly to them. I'd like them to be able to engage right away. 
-I'd like them to be enjoyable with a player count as low as 2 so that it will be easy to find someone to play with. 
-Finally a theme that anyone could enjoy (or themeless). 

As an example, One of the games I'm thinking off is Kluster.

Do the lovely Reddit community have any good suggestions to help me put a smile on a young person's face this Christmas.

"This came up in an argument and I'm conflicted. If you're in a game where someone can asymmetrically attack a player (think something like placing a robber in catan), can the player reveal their cards to the potentially attacking player to show that they're less of a threat (if revealing that you like victory points in your development cards?)

On the one hand it feels innovative in the moment, your normal strength (the fact that your turn can't be predicted) is inverted, your weakness is your defense. 

On the other hand, part of the joy of these games is working with the limited knowledge and figuring out the best course of action with what information you have. The mind games involved with underselling your strength. 

I don't know if catan in particular says you can't,  but generally speaking, is it implicitly against the rules if not outright stated?

"I've been looking into Chesslike games recently, and found For the Crown in the process. Essentially, it's a combination of Chess and Dominion. This might sound clunky at first, but the way the two systems interact is actually really smart. [This review on BoardGameGeek](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/934272/medieval-love-child-islaythedragon-review-crown) summarizes the gameplay pretty well, but here's a *very* quick tldr if you don't want to read that:

* The game consists of a chess board, dominion-style cards and various unit types (lots of whom move differently from the standard chess units)
* your Chess armies start off with only a King, you also start with a starting deck of 10 cards
* you essentially start off playing dominion, but most cards let you do a training action, which lets you trash that card in order to deploy chess units onto the board
* some cards can influence the chessboard, allowing you to move units in different ways, granting extra moves, sabotaging your opponent's units, et cetera
* you win by capturing your opponent's king (or *all* of your opponent's king-type units, if they happen to have multiple)

I don't really see a lot of people talk about this game (maybe because it doesn't seem to be in print anymore), but the few people that do talk about it often give it tons of praise. If you played it before, what's your opinion on the game? If you haven't played it, would you consider adding it to your collection?

"I’ve recently started playing Pandemic with my nieces and nephew.  There are four of us, and at that player count the game seems easy. (We’re playing at Standard level with five epidemics.)  The easy-seeming feeling might be due to these factors:

  - With four players you have four hands to work with.  After a few rounds that’s a lot of cards, and it’s easier to get five (or four) cards of the same color into a single hand.
  - Having four players makes it easier to have someone in each “hot spot” around the globe.
  - Player count of four greatly magnifies the powers of the Dispatcher (move other pawns, join any pawn to any other).

When my wife and I play with just two, we typically lose.  We’ve lost in all sorts of ways but most often just by running out of cards.

I’m not sure if we’re overlooking some kind of rule, or just not very clever.

"Hi folks!

A friend of mine recently introduced our game group to Sword of Rome by GMT Games (US bg publisher) and I was amazed at how good it played. We had a blast and I had never heard of this game until we played and after some research, could see why it was one of GMT's classics back when it came out. Playing my first game with 5 players was daunting but the asymmetry of each civilization and theme really got me into it and I can't wait to play again!

Now I want a copy of my own but sadly it's out of print and can go for double the prince online. Looking into this, I found out that GMT still runs reprints of their games when demand is there. 

So!! If you've been looking for this game or any other board game by GMT, they have what they call a P500 pre-order list. Essentially you can pre-order out-of-print games, at no initial cost, until they see that they have 500 orders for the game. Then the game gets bumped up back to printing and production. They also offer those pre-orders at about 30-40% discount which is great! Now Sword of Rome isn't there yet which is why I wanted to see if we could rally and bump those numbers up lol

This is also the first time I see a publisher website keep active track of orders so that they can bring some of their games back into printing! Love the idea and wanted to share with all of you

===

Here's a link to the game on GMT. The P500 PRE-ORDER tab near the top of that page will also bring you to their list of games in reprint and explain that program in further detail.

"A few years ago I played a card game with some friends and for the life of me I can't remember what it was called.

Here's how it works: there's a deck of cards with pictures. One person takes a turn drawing two cards, and the other players race to conjure up a clever association between the two pictures, whether in the form of a common phrase or pun. For example, a picture of dice + an island getaway = ""pair-a-dice."" The person who drew the cards determines the winner.

"The vertical calendar on the game board is divided into 12 ""rounds.""  You clearly see I, II, III, and so on, marking the rounds.

But the manual says there are Phases within each round.

A working round, for example, has 4 phases:

1. Planning
2. Action
3. Growth
4. Upkeep

Yet, the game board's calendar just shows 2 ""boxes"" (?) in the Working round.

* Meeple Icon
* Cash Register

How do these align?  Is the Meeple box on the calendar the Planning phase?  The Action phase?  The Growth phase?  All of the above?  The manual doesn't seem to explain, sadly.

Same with Exhibition rounds.  Per the manual they have 5 phases:

1. Prestige Exchange
2. Show
3. Award
4. Sales
5. Upkeep

Yet, the game board's calendar just shows 4 boxes in Exhibition rounds:

* Prestige tokens
* Show
* Cash Register
* Card Flip

So in the Working Round, for example, we don't know on which phase to move the Calendar token from the Meeple Icon to the Cash Register.

If anyone could help, we'd greatly appreciate it.  
Thanks

Just seems like an incredibly frustrating disconnect in design, between the manual's Phases and the Game board's Calendar.  If the # of boxes on the calendar aligned 1:1 with the phases in the Manual, there'd be no problem.  Or, even if the board (or manual) just had a ""key"" then it could dictate, for example whether or not all Cash Registers = Upkeep.","Pret-a-Porter - Help!

"This is something I was thinking about the other day when I was playing Dinosaur World. I enjoy most everything about the game except the boredom rule/tokens. Its is a worker placement/engine builder game where you are building a dinosaur park. I know the purpose of the rule is to dissuade you from using the same tiles often but I always feel meh about it. 

I think a lot of it is the tokens themselves are laughably small and its a pain to grab them so you can swap it with the next higher number. I was able to fix it by replacing them with some 12mm dice to act as counters. World of a difference. Just pick the die up and turn it to the next number. 

I've recently decided to also leave the rule out when I'm teaching the game to new people. It adds a pretty deep layer of thought to the game because you have to keep changing your path through your park and weighing whether it's worth going to certain tiles again.

We will have a very flexible format that will allow the tournament to be played with only 5 rounds (counting less than 54 players, otherwise it will be increased to 7 rounds). We are aiming to start in January.

The format will be **double-elimination tournament**: Each player will have 2 'opportunities' to win a game and advance to next round, so each player would play a **minimum of 2 games** and a **maximum of 5 (or 7) games**.

All the games will be played in **ACTS** (cards) + **Vassal** (for map / counters) + **WhatsApp** (diplomacy and communication between players). Powers will be selected randomly in the first game and after that they will be chosen according to the previous results.

"Howdy y'all. So here's the deal... I feel like I have come up with a pretty good speed mechanic inspired from classic videogames like Final Fantasy Tactics.

To start, most stats in the game function in a typical manner. 4 Move means you can move 4 spaces, 3 attack means you roll 3 dice, etc.

Speed, however, works in a reversed way; the lower the score, the better. Basically, each ""round"" is done on a track counting down from 10 to 1. Each player starts on 10. If their speed is 5, when they take their action they move down 4 spaces to number 6 on the track. If their speed is 3, they move down the track 3 spaces to 7, etc. When multiple players are stacked on one number, the player on top goes, then the next, and so on. The round ends when each player has reached 0 on the Speed track.

The problem comes in when an action effects both Speed and another stat. If I say something like ""each critical hit with this weapon reduces the attacked player's Move by 1 and increases their Speed by 1,"" it SOUNDS like it should make them faster, not slower. And I am just at a wall with what to do with this.

Any thoughts/advice/ideas, community? Is it a nothing-burger in the context of the game, or do I revamp the way my stats work? Something in the middle? I'm just not sure. I'd sure appreciate y'all's help.",Help!

"Here is all I recall:

It was a pdf print out. The method was storytelling with drawing. So you draw some monsters in a world that you create (I remember there was something like you can build a relic, building, geographical features...) And the over arching story is that humans are coming back to this world where the monsters are. You have a 52 card desk with each suit being a season (like diamonds is winter for example). 

You draw cards for the season you are in and out corresponds to either an action or a story piece (maybe like I draw 5 of diamonds and that says ""either create a new discovery that was made or draw a new building and describe what it's for""). 

Basically the monsters are trying to get ready for war with the humans, or that's what I recall.

"Big spoilers for Era 2, Chapter 6 and beyond in Familiar Tales.

&amp;#x200B;

So my friends and I have been playing Familiar Tales and loving it. It's the only legacy game that we've actually attempted and so far been successful at continuing . However, a certain part in era 2 chapter 6 has really made us reconsider going back. 

In story 602, as the familiars are fleeing, we are told that they must leave all but one of their non-starting items behind:

 *Each familiar can only bring one item card in their pack. A familiar's starting item card does not count towards this limit.* 

Now we spent a lot of resources to get these, but for most items we weren't too sour. We were getting over powered anyway, and we trusted that the next era would have more new items for us to craft. What really hit us in the gut, mostly the Chalk player, was losing our story items (artifact cards? I can't remember what they're called). The chalk player decided to keep his armor that dealt damager to attacking enemies, but he was heartbroken to give up his hammer that we was so excited to get. Similarly, as the Blaze character, I was very hesitant to give up either my armor or one of my better weapons. In the end it was the armor, since the Chalk player kept his armor. 

Basically this is a clarification on the rules and a rant about how it ruined our game. We literally had to give up all but one of the items that we worked hard to get. I guess it *kinda* makes sense storyline-wise, but at the same time, there's a literal *stone golem*. Why can't he just pick up a hammer? Why can't the fox already be wearing the armor? Why did the storyline specifically tell us that the familiars struggled to pick up a damn *book*, but not their own items? We don't even get the book! It has NOTHING to do with the story anymore. 

And I understand that we're get replacement items in era 3 (spoilers ahead), however we took a bit of a sneak peek at what we might be getting (I know, ruining the surprise, but we were very disheartened at this point), and it turns out that Chalk doesn't get a new weapon. Like, he's set up to be the defensive guy, I get it, but when that's all he is, it's difficult to get power, which makes it difficult to get new cards, which just leaves his character underpowered. He should have access to another weapon! 

The end of the game should ramp up in difficult by ramping up the enemies, not stripping the characters of all their hard work. And personally, as a loot goblin, I hate hate HATE having to choose between my three armor piece, three weapons and my loaf of bread (okay, the bread was easy to toss).

Finally, I feel like this punishes the players that play the game for the storyline, and not just to run through it as quickly as possible. If it was something that the creators wanted to happen to make sure that everyone was on an even playing field going into era 3, then it should have been a mandatory thing at some point, not as a punishment while actually enjoying the game. Or at least made it a skill check. You know, maybe do an agility or a might skill test to see if your characters can pick up their own weapons and armor. At least give us a chance!

Okay, deep breaths. Basically I'm just looking for confirmation that the game is worth it to keep going. Can someone please tell me that we either messed up and we can keep even *one* more item, or that the game surprises us with something to make it worth it. Please, we need the hope.",A certain part in Familiar Tales has left our playgroup sour and unsure if we even want to continue.

I was coming here to seek help from fellow board game players on the title of the game. The only things I remember are the following:

1. The game consisted of one individual who had the master code and their mission is to help everyone else on the team figure out the code. The master has 3 trifolds up facing them so that no one else can see them. 
2. The game master gives clues to each player and there are 3 rows of tiles and your goal is for every player to get through all the tiles and correctly guess their tile within a certain number of turns or you all lose. 
3. I think the game pieces for each player looked like the sorry game figures? Also, the tiles were square shaped I believe.

"Greetings everyone

I am inspired to get my first campaign game

I had made up my mind of getting Roll Player Adventures (since Kickstarter campaign is also up). I heard good good things about it and I also liked the dice manipulation aspect of it (can suit to multiple gamer levels)

I think it's around 20 hours of storytelling and the rest mostly a puzzle game to defeat bosses.  

It has been so long though I kept hearing about Oathsworn and decided to check it out a bit. To my surprise Oathsworn also contains a campaign game, also clocking around 20 hours I think (maybe a little less) but with a boss fight game on top.

Both games also cost slightly similar.

Now understandably I could only pick one. Oathsworn seems to be the better deal, but I also wanted your opinion guys. It might be sitting at an unreal 9.3 in bgg, but I saw kany reviewers giving it an 8.

I have many questions in mind, such as:
- 1. Which game has the better overarching narrative?
- 2. Do the bosses of Oathsworn dillute the game too much or maybe in contrast, Roll Player gets repetitive with constant narration and dice manipulation?
- 3. does the Oathsworn battle/ narrative fit for smaller ages? (Seems like a 14+ game for me)
Can it be handled from lighter gamers as well?
- 4. Maybe 65 hours is just too much to complete a game and eventually it loses its stream???

Feel free though to share any further comments/concerns though :)

"Hello! I'm trying to find the name of a game from my meories; sadly, they are vague and maybe even somewhat corrupted.

The things I remember said game to be:

* Space sci-fi strategy, most probably 4X
* Several distinct races
* Some pretty creative mechanics for said races, some even going meta (e.g. an effect that forces a player to speak in reverse, but I don't remember what exactly these mechanics are)
* Released 70's to 80's, most probably the former

A little bit about myself: I am Canadian, but I have been living in South America since 2004. I began designing board games in 2015, and have games published in Peru ([Psychomachia](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/190758/psychomachia)) and Brazil ([Revanche](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/198005/revanche), [Carnavalesco](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/293890/carnavalesco)).

When I’m not making games, I’m making maps. I graduated from the Cartography program at the Centre of Geographic Sciences in my home province of Nova Scotia. If it sounds familiar, you may have seen it featured on History Channel’s The Curse of Oak Island.

When I’m lucky, I get to make games that have maps! [Seven Bridges](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/266188/seven-bridges) was my first, and **Hike It! – The Backpacking Board Game** is my second.

OK we are at the end of October.  Two months to go.  We've won all the months so far with about 66% wins total.

Early in October we encountered the traitor mechanic and lost our beloved Johnny.  Lost that game, but managed to get Patient Zero and therefore unlocked the immunologist and the ability to create and administer vaccines.

We decided to focus 100% on vaccinating cities in our second October game, knowing full well that we'd probably lose the month.   We wound up vaccinating 11 cities, including all of North America except New York, but had a few more cities get into a worse rioting status.  The last two turns had a heavy dose of bad luck &amp; cascades leading to our loss by too many outbreaks.  Keeping with our vaccination strategy, we wound up with two permanent vaccine factories.  oh and we destroyed all but three of the military bases, which was the other thing we tried to focus on (both to make vaccinating easier and make the next game's vaccinations easier, too).

"The way I know Incan Gold, each artefact is simply worth 5 points and if you ever get more than three of them, which I've never seen happen, the ones above three are worth 10 points instead.

I just bought a new version of the game and the artifact are now numbered and worth 5, 7, 8, 10 and 12 points, with the 5 going in at round one, 7 at round two and so on.

I'm not sure I like this new rule and was curious which way people prefer to handle the artifacts?

"My game group has rented an AirBnb to ""get away"" and play games for a long weekend (3 nights, 2 full days).  I'm super stoked to finally have enough commitments to get this scheduled!  Now to the planning...

Most important, of course -- which games?  I've already got Twilight Imperium, Advanced Civilization, Battlestar Galactica, Barrage, Planet Unknown, Terraforming Mars... but as we look through our collection, we're noticing that many of our favorites don't do 5 players, or aren't very good at 5 (Brass, Kanban, Underwater Cities, etc).  **What are some of the best mid-to-heavy games for 5 players in your experience?**

And for those of you who have done retreats like this, are there any good tips or gotchas we should consider?  Some things we have thought of so far:

* memory foam seat cushions in case their table chairs aren't comfortable for hours at a time (I use these at my house, they're essential!)
* some light game options for when we need a mental break
* playmats, dice trays, bit bowls, card caddies, poker chips / metal coins
* inventory checklists so we don't leave anything behind

Anything around food we should consider, that would be different than playing in our own homes?",Board Games Retreat for 5 Players,1,self.boardgames,z295a4,Mitrian,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/z295a4/board_games_retreat_for_5_players/,1669160670
"So, we should all be aware that a large bubble is forming around the board game market. Prices reach new record highs every year, fomo driven consumer descisions, publishers cashing in bigger ans bigger sums; the classic signs of a commodity bubble. The reasons for it are numerous. Crowdfunding being very low risk and low barrier of investment (compared to classic investors) is among them.

Now, while everyone can individually choose to participate in this or not, this post is not about that. Its just that i realized a way for me to visualize this fact is to imagine how many smaller games can fit into a larger game. I don't mean physically but in Terms of price. Lets look at a now typical 120-150€ kickstarter (like oathsworn for example). For that price you can get two to three (!) games in the 50€ price (like the entire XYZ of the west kingdom series. Architects, Viscounts and Paladins). All three games that i would have considered expensive a few years ago. Or 5 different editions of Monopoly. Or make it even more extreme and buy around TEN mini games like the entire clever series. Three times!

I recently contemplated buying a 50€ game for solo play but was hesitating because 50 feels like a lot. But the above made me realize that 50 is further from your usual kickstarters than it is from the small but fun 10-20€ games. Like how cleopatra lived closer to today than she lived to the construction of the pyramids haha.

Anyways, i don't want to make people feel bad about spending money. Everyone can buy whatever they like. Just because i don't want to feel like a pawn of publishers, doesnt mean i look down on anyone who genuinely feels these prices are worth it. Ok, long rambling post over.

"Hey everyone!  My board game group has decided to do a $30 White Elephant/Yankee Swap board game exchange at our next Board Game Brunch in December.  There's four of us, and we typically get together about once every two weeks.  Occasionally, there are some others who join us or we play separately, but for the bulk of us, this is when we play games.  So, despite the fact that we're buying each other games, really we're just buying games for the group that reside at someone's specific house.  The only rules are that it's got to be a game, no accessories or expansions.

A little about us:

* Tend to play mid-weight games, but also jump into lighter or filler-style games as well.
* Most Played this year - Dune Imperium, King's Dilemma, Shamans, Ark Nova, Everdell, So Clover!
* Themes - 1 gravitates towards space, 1 engrossed in fantasy, and 2 absorbed by nature/animals

I've been looking at the following and am curious if y'all have any thoughts:

* [Libertalia: Winds of Galecrest](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/356033/libertalia-winds-galecrest) \- little over the price, but seems to fit the weight and theme spot on
* [Furnace](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/318084/furnace)\- I have personally been eyeing this one, but the bidding/engine-building mechanics have been a hit with other games (Nidavellir, Modern Art, Wingspan, Ark Nova/Terraforming Mars)
* [Picture Perfect](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/299963/picture-perfect) \- this ones a bit of a coin toss, but it seems like an interesting premise
* [MicroMacro](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/318977/micromacro-crime-city) \- Not necessarily a game, but the other parties are a single mom and a married couple.

"There is one game I have in mind. Spirit Island. I've heard a lot of people say that it takes many hours and is incredibly difficult and brainy. Now, I've playedthis game tons, with beginners to experts, from 0 difficulty to 11. One thing that sticks out is that whether people find the first few games tedious or not depends pretty much solely on a single strategic choice: Are you going aggressively against builds or trying to prevent ravages?

Even when I'm barely giving any hints whenever I play with beginners, they have an easy game. It is because I make really sure they understand a single thing: Wasting resources on preventing ravages = bad, letting ravages happen and preventing builds = good.

I recently played a 4 player game with 3 newbies and just made sure they understand that single concept. They made the right strategic choices right away even though they weren't even the brainy, hard thinking types. The game was a breeze. They didn't have to make any difficult brainy decisions because all the threats were easily contained.

I guess in coop games having the right core strategy is always important. From all the games I've played though (granted only a dozen or so) Spirit Island really stuck out with the concept. Especially, since there is such a large number of players who intuitively choose the wrong base strategy.

"Hello everyone.

To clarify, I have Etherfields and almost every expansion, minus the Thorn knight and the kickstarter exclusive sleeves w/storage box.

I was able to obtain sleeves 3rd party, but am having trouble finding a storage solution that meets my needs. With the sleeves off, I barely have enough space in the given insert to have the base game and the 5th player expansion inside the box. I definitely don't have enough space for sleeves or anything else to fit in there for that matter. However, I don't want a new insert, just a box capable of fitting anything extra and not in use for the time being.

The cards w/sleeves are 63.5 × 88mm, while the tiles w/sleeves are 100 × 100mm. I need something capable of holding them side-by-side, possibly with an off-center divider (movable/modular/maybe magnetic?) running its length to keep the cards and tiles in their own separate rows.

Been looking around, but I can't seem to find anything besides TCG boxes. Even ones that have adequate interior depth to fit the tiles all have length-wise dividers that would only fit the cards, none of which seem to be adjustable.

I guess I can make something on my own with a shoe box and some foam or something, but I would prefer if I found something of higher quality than I cam make if I can help it.

If the game has 5 rounds and in every round you can score a maximum of 5 points you should try to score 5 points every round to get the total of 25. But in most worker placement games you are not able to score 5 points in round 1 so this adds up to \[and here I am opening the calculator app\] 6.something points from round 2-5 but you won't make 6 points in round 2 either so \[this gets complicated...\].... Are you having these kinds of thoughts during the game? Is this something you actually calculate?  


Do you know what the ressources are worth in points e.g. this type of resource is quite rare so at the moment it is worth 5-7 VP whereas later when Player B has cashed out his 10 resources they are readily available again and worth 1 VP?  


Do you take two Scoring Cards and only work towards those and hope this is enough points?

&amp;#x200B;

How much math is going on in your brain while gaming? 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm deliberately being very unspecific with games here as I sometimes do have difficulties finding out the best / a very good action compared to medium or sub par ones.

"A week ago the show ""Wetten dass..."" aired on german TV. It's a live show with a ling history where participants often claim that they can perform outlandish tasks like recognizing songs only from the Bubbles it produces when singing them underwater or being able to hold on to a soup Bowl with only your abs while the soup bowl is Lifted by a helicopter and flies over a stadium.

On the last installment, a perticipant claimed that he could recognize board games only through the sound it makes when turning the full box upside down and letting all the mazerials fall down into a plastic container. He ofc aced the challenge and immediately knew every game.

While i wanted to let you know about this cute little anecdote, i also wanted to ask if you think this is believable. Often with these challenges, you don't know if the participant has trained a lot or if there is some trick behind it like in magic shows. So, do you think you could make out boardgames from the sound of their components hitting the table? How would you distinguish between games like 6 nimmt and hanabi?

"Hello /r/boardgames!

I made /u/bgg_link_bot which analyzes the posts and comments on /r/boardgames and replies with [BoardGameGeek.com](https://boardgamegeek.com) links to the games it found in the text.

## Why?

I often found myself reading the game suggestion comments then copy the names, going to bgg and searching for them over and over. Wouldn't it be easier to have direct links to these games? I took heavy inspiration from /u/LegoLinkBot (cheers to /u/mkdir) and so bgg\_link\_bot was born.

## How does it work?

It is now in beta, meaning you have to opt-in ([send a message with opt-in](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=bgg_link_bot&amp;subject=Opt-in&amp;message=opt-in)) for it to process all your new posts/comments on /r/boardgames. If you don't want to opt-in, you can also mention it using /u/bgg_link_bot to process only a specific post/comment. It then takes the text (and the title for posts) and tries to look for any of the top 2000 (for now) games on bgg and replies with links to those in the order it found them.

Please try it, and try to break it, because I know it will. The bot is new, so it may be rate-limited by reddit, meaning it has to pause for some time, so if you don't get a reply instantly, don't worry, it will come in a few minutes.

What do you want to see other than links to the games? Would adding the game rank, rating or complexity be interesting to you? Do you have any questions or suggestions? Leave a comment, or you can even send me a message.

## Example post text, just for you to see how does a reply look like

"Over the past few years, I’ve started to really find a love and appreciation for “old” games. Mostly games before we started to see mass produced games with licensing such as Monopoly, like chess, checkers, mancala, etc. I started to learn go a couple years ago (still not good at it) and now just recently I’ve really fell in love with Japanese (riichi) mahjong thanks to Final Fantasy XIV and Clubhouse Games on the Switch. And lately one of my most played games on my Switch has been Clubhouse Games, so I finally started to realize that I would really enjoy playing some of these classics in person with my large board game loving family.

"  I've become interested in Archipelago recently and I'm also a huge fan of John Company. For those who don't know, both deal heavily with colonialism. 

Archipelago's setting is not as clearly defined as John Company, but it seems to be (from cards and the map) about colonization of the central/south America by the Europeans. The players play as the colonizers and can use cards that sometimes strongly imply that they are trading slaves and in different way oppressing natives, as was done historically of course. The natives can fight back though, and everyone loses if there is an uprising.

John Company is about the East indian company in England from the 1700s and forward. It's setting is way more defined and you're still exploiting the natives of India but in this case it's so you can buy nice houses back home in England. The artwork on the different cards often portrait the English in caricature and it often seems more ""clear"" how ridiculous the whole endeavour of subjugating a foreign land just so you can buy nice houses back home.

Both games encourage players to act in devious and self interest ways. In short, if you're playing the games right, you're most likely acting like a shit.

I know some reviews (SU&amp;SD) comment on the problematic content of Archipelago and in John Company's case, the creator is very open about how horrible the people you're playing as is.

Questions for discussion!

* Does one game treat it's subject matter better than the other? (Are there other games that I haven't play that do it better?)
* Do you feel bad or horrible playing either of these games? (For instance, using the ""Triangular Trade"" card in Archipelago makes me shiver)
* Is there a way to present this sort of subject matter in a way that makes it both fun to play but also makes the players questions the actions they take in the game?","Discussion: ""Problematic"" subject matter in boardgames.

# Nightmare Productions

Making movies, auctions, and Reiner Knizia. You really only need a sprinkling of two of those things to have me interested, yet [Nightmare Productions](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/904/nightmare-productions) possesses all three in spades. That’s why this one earned a spot among my [most anticipated games of 2022](https://bitewinggames.com/most-anticipated-board-games-of-2022-part-2/); particularly because I’ve never played the older editions of Nightmare Productions (Dream Factory, Hollywood Blockbuster, Hollywood Golden Age, Traumfabrik, etc.).  This one is yet another beloved Knizia classic that has been around for decades and aged quite well.

The only thing that has changed about this fresh reimplementation is the theme.  Where previous editions feature classic actors such as John Wayne and Audrey Hepburn, or parody names such as Leonardo Dicapuccino and Steven Iceburg, this version trades out the pop culture references for the horror genre.  Actors are replaced by creatures, guest stars are replaced by monster cameos, camera crews are replaced by spooky locations, and special effects are replaced by deadly props. Where pop culture can so quickly be outdated or tiresome, I find that I vastly prefer this new theme and more lively presentation.

Players act as competing production companies seeking to make the best (or worst) movies.  You’ll have three film strips in front of you with spaces that require specific tile types to complete — a director here, a creature there, two props together, and so on.  When a movie is complete, the film strip and tiles combine to give you a star total indicating the quality of your movie.  More stars means a better movie, and you’ll plop a rating marker on your film to show both how it compares to rival movies as well as how many points it’ll score at the end of the game.  Bonus points will be awarded to the first movie or best movie that is made in each sub-genre (such as creature features or paranormal flicks) as well as the all-time best casting or worst film.  These awards are what bring some crunchy, competitive strategy to the table.

Now that I’m two plays in, the main thing that keeps coming to mind is how this one compares to the eleven other Knizia auctioning games I’ve tried. In terms of exploring a single genre or mechanism, twelve is a heck of a lot of designs for one creator to crank out. Yet I can look at each of these titles and testify that they are both unique and enjoyable.  That’s why Reiner is the king of auctioning games.

While it doesn’t feel derivative, Nightmare Productions still reminds me of Medici. In either case, you’re progressing through a series of auctions divided into multiple scoring rounds.  Each auction, you’re bidding for a winner-take-all set of stuff using your own points (money counts as points in Nightmare Productions).  It’s your most classic style of auction, bid increasingly higher amounts in clockwise order until all but one player passes. Any stuff that you win gets slotted into the available spaces of your personal area, and that collection contributes to a larger competition for scoring bonus points between rounds and at the end of the game.  But where the winner’s bid in Medici simply evaporates into thin air as their point marker plummets down the track, the winning bid in Nightmare Productions actually gets split evenly between the auction losers.

Slotting your winnings into your player area is also far more nuanced in Nightmare Productions.  Each strip has an optional cameo space that can be filled to boost your star count.  Some spaces are easier to fill, as they accept multiple options (location/prop/music/director).  Some tiles are wild “contracts” which can be placed anywhere.  And creatures and cameos contribute to turn order priority during the drafting phases sprinkled throughout the game.

All that said, the simpler mechanisms of Medici actually make for a more dramatic game.  Nightmare Productions has nearly all of its tiles displayed on the board face up, allowing players to plan their strategy carefully and methodically for an entire round.  Meanwhile, Medici is more loose and suspenseful as each player decides when to stop revealing cards to be put up for auction — cards that can either cause a spike or a plummet in the set’s value.  The other key difference is that once a player fills a film strip in Nightmare Productions, they simply grab another one and keep going.  In Medici, once you’ve filled your boat board, you are completely out for the rest of the round and must watch in agony or glee as the remaining cards come out of the deck to be auctioned off without you.

Although it’s interesting to compare Nightmare Productions and Medici, I would not say that one is objectively better than the other. Those who prefer a more zesty theme with increased considerations will gravitate toward Nightmare Productions. Those who delight in more highs and lows with a constant, underlying tension will opt for Medici.  I’d say in either case, you can’t go wrong.

**Prognosis: Good**

Dice and zombies—the ketchup and fries of board gaming.  And who better to trust a set of dice to than the mathematician who has over 130 published dice rolling games under his belt?

With [Zombie Mania](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/167850/zombie-mania), a 2014 game now back from the dead thanks to publisher Trick or Treat Studios, Reiner Knizia invites us once more to enjoy chucking a fistful of dice.  Much like Pickomino (aka Heckmeck), players take turns rolling a bunch of dice and setting some aside after each roll until they choose to stop or bust.  Also like Pickomino, you’ll need to roll a very important side if you want your results to mean anything.

Zombie Mania is all about rolling pairs to get the job done.  Pairs of tombstones, pairs of buildings, pairs of zombies, etc.  Apparently being undead comes with the side effect of loneliness.  If you want to be able to do anything on your turn, your 8 dice need to roll at least 2 tombstones.  Once you have your pair of tombstones, you’re free to start clearing your player board of zombies.

Rolling a pair of single green zombies or single blue zombies lets you get rid of one zombie from your board.  Rolling a pair of double red zombies allows you to clear two zombies from your board.  Normally, these evicted zombies end up in the graveyard (a discard pile) unless you roll a pair of buildings which allows you to instead pile those zombies on another player’s board.  Finally a pair of x2’s will double the amount of zombies you can get rid of.  But remember, you can only get rid of zombies if you have a pair of tombstones among your dice results.

You’re not limited to a specific number of rerolls.  Rather, each time you roll your dice, you must set aside at least one zombie die.  The moment you don’t roll any zombies is the moment you instantly bust—your turn is over.  But each die has a 50/50 shot of rolling a zombie, so it’s possible to push your luck quite far while you aim to assemble the best pairs of dice. Notably, this rule can result in an awkward turn fizzle-out when you still need one more tombstone for your results to mean anything *but* you only have 1 die remaining that you can roll — meaning that even if you successfully roll a tombstone with the last die, you automatically bust because it is not a zombie. I’m not a fan of this special case scenario, but it happens infrequently enough (and turns are fast enough) that it’s not a huge deal.

Just like all Knizia dice games, the tough decisions are enshrouded within what appears to be a massive luckfest.  Which dice do you keep… how many do you reroll?  Do you play it safe or risk it for the biscuit?  

The way a player travels down these subtle branching paths will determine whether they look like a lucky fool or a fool down on their luck.  As always, it’s an enjoyable journey to take and to watch others take.  Yet with Zombie Mania in particular, it’s possible for this traveling group to find themselves stuck in an endless loop—trapped less in a Zombie Apocalypse and more in the Twilight Zone.

You see, the game ends when a player starts their turn with zero zombies on their board.  That means that on their previous turn, they kicked out the remaining zombies and then watched with glee as all of their opponents failed to send a zombie back their way.  Yet our first play of Zombie Mania proved that nailing the leader with a zombie (and thus stopping them from winning) is exhaustingly easy to accomplish.

Although you need 6 of your 8 dice to churn out a specific combination in order to nail an opponent—a pair of tombstones, a pair of buildings, and a pair of zombies—we managed to do this again, and again, and again, and again, and again.

I believe I was the first player to clear my board of zombies.  It’s a little bit fuzzy, as all of us cleared our boards multiple times as we played a twisted version of hot potato with the few remaining zombies that didn’t end up in the graveyard.  Collectively, we probably cleared our boards 20 times.

At the time players started clearing their boards, we were probably 15 or 20 minutes into the game.  From there, it was another agonizingly long 15 or 20 minutes of sending the zombies around and around from one empty board to the next.  Although it’s unlikely, it’s theoretically possible for this game to go 2 or 3 or 4 or who knows how many times longer than it should.  It reminds me of the [Isner v. Mahut Wimbledon match of 2010](https://youtu.be/jUgyaoew8as) where the poor saps played 11 hours of tennis across 3 days because neither athlete was able to win two games in a row to seal the victory.  Professional tennis tournaments, including Wimbledon, have since amended this rule to prevent matches from going on too long.

I’m honestly surprised that Reiner didn’t address this potential endless loop issue during development.  One simple rule could have done the trick.  Something like: *collect a token each time you clear your board; if you have cleared your board 3 times, instantly win the game.*  That’s probably a house rule I’ll have to shoehorn into the game next time we play.  The silver lining here is that I genuinely do want to play Zombie Mania again, just not with the undying ending 😆.  If you can manage to look past that plot hole or fill it in yourself, then it’s still a rather enjoyable dice chucker. 

**Prognosis: Fair\***

# Transatlantic

I’ve heard gamers describe certain games as spreadsheets, but never has this sentiment rang more true for me than with [Transatlantic](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/163805/transatlantic).  If you ever wondered what Concordia would be like if it was combined with Microsoft Excel, then look no further.

Transatlantic is all about buying ships and using them to transport stuff across the ocean.  Each ship is represented by a card with 6 numbers and 1 color.  You read that right—6 functional quantities and 1 functional flag color.  These cards are arranged on an ocean spreadsheet as if someone had clicked “Sort by Year.”  From there, it’s just a mix of formulas embedded into the sheet where players take turns plugging in variables and watching the results spew out gradually larger numbers.

Just like Concordia, you cycle through your initially symmetrical hands but then slowly diverge as you add more cards from the market.  One card makes you money, another scores you points, another lets you buy stuff from the market, another let’s you copy an opponent’s last card, and yet another lets you pick up all of your played cards so you can do it over again.  One thing is for sure: nobody needs to point out that these games come from the same designer.

But rather than navigating a map, staking your claim on regions, and triggering production in those regions, here you are simply buying some ship cards, slotting them into ocean columns, collecting some bonuses based on “greater than” formulas, placing coal cubes on those cards, and then spending the cubes back off of those cards to earn some money so you can do it all over again.  For 2 hours.

Any sense of thematic immersion that Concordia possesses is tossed out here in favor of numbers, numbers, and more numbers…  This boat’s speed is 15 while that boat’s speed is 14.  This ship can hold 400 passengers, while that ship can hold 600 passengers.  This ship costs 50 pounds, while that ship costs 40 pounds.  This ship was built in 1875, while that other one was built in 1876.  This ship pays out 20, but that other one pays out 30.  In the words of Robo-Colonel Sanders, “It’s number-licking good.”

Transatlantic reminds me of a modern day screen addict—one who is so swallowed up in social trends and internet media that they fail to develop a personality of their own.  I feel as though I’m playing a Concordia husk supported by a spreadsheet skeleton.  With the impending release of Crossing Oceans—the 2022 sequel to Transatlantic—one can only hope that this swapping of husks from Concordia’s card cycler to Imperial’s rondel brings more life to this nautical monotony.

# Puzzle Strike 2

Oh boy.  Let’s just rip that band-aid right off and get straight to the pain:

[Puzzle Strike 2](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/350079/puzzle-strike-2) somehow manages to take every design and publishing philosophy that I hold dear and crash it to pieces, much like the gem crashing of its theme.  It’s impressive how audacious it is, really.  In other words, this is the most un-me game that I’ve played since Unstable Unicorns.

Straight out of the gates, Puzzle Strike 2 presents itself with an art style that makes my eyes bleed.  The cartoony neon rainbow explosion here is the equivalent of filling a 2-liter with all of the slurpee flavors at 7-Eleven and drinking the entire container in 3 seconds.  While your brain is still screaming from the sensory overload, you’ll remove the lid to find a massive, battery powered, light-up fairy wand that looks like my 3-year-old snuck it out of her toy chest and crammed it into the game box when I wasn’t looking.  But no, that wand is indeed an intended board game component.

From there, you’ll be playing a hybrid of solitaire deck building mixed with wand-wielding King of Tokyo mixed with take-that Candy Crush where the objective is to make your opponents bust while you survive the onslaught of incoming gems.  Your player board features a column where various colored gems drop down into, and you’ll need to rearrange them and crash them efficiently in order to keep this tower from hitting its deadly threshold.  

Much like Tetris, clearing gems off of your board will send them over to your opponents for them to deal with.  And as players upgrade their decks they’ll be executing even more deadly combos until somebody can’t clean up their incoming mess.  Yet for a game with such a confrontational objective, the player turns have never felt more solitaire.

In a 4-player game, you’ll spend most of your time watching your opponents work through the puzzly solitaire challenge of whittling down their gem stack and blocking incoming gems.  With increasingly bigger board problems and increasingly larger hand combos, the downtime only gets worse as the game progresses onward.

Downtime is only the first red flag that tells me Puzzle Strike 2 should have probably been an exclusively 2 player design.  The second red flag comes in the form of the end game: once one player busts in a 3-4 player game, the remaining players take one last turn to determine the winner.  This turn is essentially players flexing their last hand as much a possible, and whoever gets the best combo on their turn wins the game.  So the objective is to not be the first person eliminated, and then hope you luck into a good hand for your last turn.

The third red flag comes in the form of the stated playtime of 20-30 minutes.  That may be true for a 2-player game, but it’s a downright lie in a 4-player game which plays closer to an hour or more.

Where the game doesn’t seem to respect itself in terms of a realistic player count, an honest play time, reasonable game components, and more, I struggle to respect it as a participant.  

That’s a shame, because it seems like a lot of thought and effort went into crafting the many asymmetric starter decks and market cards.  And I’m sure that some folks will enjoy it’s zany antics, particularly as a 2-player dueling game.  But even if you cast all of my surface complaints aside, I still prefer dueling games and deck builders where the player interaction is the focal point rather than a turn-by-turn solitaire puzzle combo contest.

*3 Plays (1 Player)*

I don’t often seek out solo games, but sometimes I stumble across great ones.  This is true of Trailblazers which we took on as a publishing project before I tried and got hooked on the solo modes.  It’s also true of [Resist!](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/352697/resist), which comes from a team up of designers behind many solid games including Undaunted, Mandala, Switch &amp; Signal, and more.

Resist is a cleverly thematic deck deconstruction game of playing as the underground resistance in Spain nearly 100 years ago.  You start with a band of 12 Maquis and 3 Spies (junk cards) forming your deck.  From there, you’ll be drawing 5 cards and selecting a mission to take on with that hand.

Your cards are large—tarot sized—because each Maquis card features a “hidden” side and a “revealed” side with their own unique attack value and action.  The *revealed* side of each card is more powerful, as it represents the Maquis blowing their cover and making one last stand to help the cause of the resistance before they presumably flee or are captured by the oppressive Spanish ruler.  In other words, if you play a card as *hidden* then it will cycle back into your deck through your discard pile.  If you play a card as revealed, then that card will be removed from your deck entirely (unless another card’s action allows you to pull a revealed card back into your deck).

The cards that you play, whether hidden or revealed, must combine to an attack value that is greater than the chosen mission’s defense value in order to succeed in that round.  On top of that, each mission will have 3 or more facedown enemy cards that only become revealed when you commit to the mission (or you can flip them early with some Maquis planning actions).  These enemies add further headaches to your short-term objectives and long-term success unless you can take them down as well. 

Just like all of my favorite solo games, there is a push-your-luck element here.  The risks and rewards come in the form of selecting a specific mission as well as deciding when to end the game entirely.  Each round you’ll try to string together the best Maquis actions such as drawing extra cards from your deck, sniping or chasing off enemy cards, adding more Maquis to your deck, and pushing your attack value above the threshold as you try to avoid several losing conditions and take back control of Spain.  Your deck will quickly shed revealed Maquis cards and even slowly gain more Spies (junk cards) and at some point you’ll need to call it quits.

If you can manage to accomplish enough missions, those mission points will add up to a Minor Victory, Victory, Major Victory, or clean sweep of Spain.  And it’s definitely not an easy feat to even win.  My first attempt at the game ended in an epic failure, and my second attempt resulted in me barely squeezing by with a Victory.

This 30-minute challenge is compelling and unique enough that I’m happy to have backed and played it.  But as a hobbyist who strongly prefers player interaction in my gaming, I would quickly lose interest in Resist if there was nothing more in the box to keep me coming back.  Once I’ve seen all that a solitaire game has to offer, and especially once I feel like I’ve overcome the general challenge, then I typically lose the hunger to retread the same ground.  Fortunately, the designers (Trevor Benjamin, Roger Tankersly, and David Thompson) have gone the extra mile by including 8 standalone scenarios in the box beyond the standard game.  This ensures that I have several more interesting challenges with unique rulesets to come back to, and I’ve only scratched the surface of those.

# Carnegie

Ahh yes, efficiency Euros.  One of the great pillars of board gaming.  Where cubes are resources and resources are points and points are life.  You know, the more efficiency Euros I try, the more I ask myself why I didn’t just play my proven favorites like Brass or Sidereal Confluence or Hansa Teutonica or Eclipse or Great Western Trail or Pipeline instead.

Those who have followed my first impressions posts have heard me blather time and time again about how lots of efficiency Euros blur together into the same bland flavor.  This flavor often lacks spicy interaction, potent strategies, and unique textures—where the playing payoff doesn’t measure up to the effort required to learn what is ultimately a recycled experience.  

Yet every year tends to release at least one or two efficiency Euros which stand out and rise above the rest…  Euros that aren’t forgettable, that feel refreshing and exciting, that reward repeated plays and respect the investment of the players.  If I had to bet on a strong contender for best efficiency Euro of 2022, then my current pick would be [Carnegie](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/310873/carnegie).

While the theme here is as basic as… do stuff that wealthy entrepreneur Andrew Carnegie did… that doesn’t really matter once one dives into the stunning production and meaty mechanisms.  The standout elements here are two things:

&amp;#x200B;

1. The timeline track where players take turns advancing an action marker to trigger the next event and activate the action for everyone.
2. Your personal company board where you’ll add specialized departments, shift and train employees within those departments, and advance your project tabs which are satisfyingly slotted into your company board.

While there are plenty other features that create tension and competition between players (things like claiming project spaces on the map or department tiles from the supply or donation benefits first), the focal point of interaction is undoubtedly the timeline track.  While players start out with roughly the same setup, over time they’ll diverge depending on where they assign their employees and when they activate them.  Keeping track of your opponents’ current focuses and needs is critical to your success, as the action marker you select and the event you trigger affects everyone.  The key is to select the best option for yourself at the most inconvenient time for others.

Yet even when your rascal of a neighbor doesn’t adhere to your schedule, you can usually still make some satisfying progress on your strategy as long as you aren’t too careless with your employee organization.  Your company board displays four floors of departments—a healthy start of 5 basic departments surrounded by a convas of opportunities.  These departments are most comparable to worker placement areas where you can position up to 3 employees at desk spaces which, if occupied, will each allow you to take that department’s action whenever activated by the timeline track.  These departments cover Human Resources (positioning your employees), Management (expanding your company board and sending employees on game board missions), Construction (building a network across the US for bonuses and points), and Research &amp; Development (improving your income and infrastructure).

The challenge of the game is adapting your strategy to the timeline track while forecasting the order in which your opponents will advance along it.  Carnegie demands forward thinking and careful preparations from its players, and then it generously rewards such behavior.  You’ll be sending out employees on missions—tragically evacuating your precious departments in the process—but if you time it just right then those relocated employees will act like magic beans that were planted on the game board and instantly grew into a towering income beanstalk overnight.  All this because you correctly predicted exactly which event someone would pick next.  Jack would be proud.

Although the game is long (up to 3 hours with 4 players), it fully fills that time with juicy Euro goodness.  I’ve come away from both sessions hungry to explore it further, and that alone elevates Carnegie high above it’s many competitors.

"[Hollandspiele](https://hollandspiele.com/) is a small indie publisher that makes a lot of bespoke weird games and historical wargames.

Here's what I have played by them:

Nicaea- a great abstract negotiation/stock game set at the Council of Nicaea during the late Roman Empire

"Hopefully your board game recollection is better than mine!

I played a card game in a cafe where each of you takes over a planets ecosystem/life forms across the age of the universe. The game began with a card that was something like ""The dawn of life"".  Each player had a genome(?) with a number that decided how many cards you could have in your hand each turn, and you had several colours of organism that you could add cards to, to update and gain points at the end of the game. Each age/epoch would have different rules based on the drawn cards, and there was a catastrophe that you could draw too. 

&amp;#x200B;

Each of the organism colours had little cartoon germ-like blobs on the art, and were different kinds of trait you could add to your life-forms. So the red cards were biological, and it would be things like ""an extra kidney"".

"Hello, 

My partner and I are looking for new 2 player games.

Few things about us : 
She isn't a hardcore board games player (yet), so she's not a big fan of games with very complex set of rules, but she has a blast when a game is easy to set up.  
Some Games I've seen her enjoy a lot when we played with friends :  Codenames, Exploding Kittens, Secret Hitler and Ticket to Ride.                       
Recently we got our first (and only) true 2 players game : Lost Cities. She loved it and we've been playing it a lot. 

So at this point, I think it would be great to get something similar to Lost Cities with some more complexity, and a bit more strategic/less luck.  Doesn't need to be exclusively a 2 player game as long as the playability with 2 players is great.

What would fit the bill ?

"Greetings fellow players !

So yesterday I could finally give a try to Dune Imperium (+ Rise of Ix, since it is universally considered necessary and note a mere extension).

It took a good turn to understand the mechanics, which became very fluid and easy to understand quickly. I had to refer to the instruction manual pretty often though for many subtleties (can I play intrigue cards whenever I want and more than one ? Are the soldiers supposed to be discarded or garrisoned ? Are the technologies a permanent asset ? Are the combat points back to 0 after a turn ? Etc).

It is a very good game; but for some reason, if the mechanics are simple, we all agreed it is a game that requires regular playing to be good with strategies. I don't mean to optimize perfect combos, but just to avoid the random playing we did for quite some time. 

Recently, we got into terraforming Mars; and while seemingly more complex, beginners understand immediately what they should play to get the better out of their cards. Preludes helps heavily for that.

"So I'm a long time Games Workshop games player but really only dipped my toes into Warhammer Quest. Love it so far but I'm wondering if it lacks long term depth that maybe other games can offer. 

I have a group of 3 friends who are keen to get together regularly for something like this and I'm wondering what game/franchise to get into. 

Pros and Cons
WFRP
Played alot when I was young and just loved the depth and extensiveness of the rules and careers. But only ever played as a pair and we did feel it lacked the visual excitement of the other table top games that use models and terrain. Expansions of the early editions are also super hard to come by. Feel like it needs a games master to really make it more interesting. 

WHQ
Super easy to get into and doesn't need a DM. Love having models and terrain for that extra fun and satisfaction in completing models. But feel it lacks depth, especially at higher levels. And might become quite repetitive, even with WD article expansions. When you've played WFRP before, the list of available player characters/careers feels shallow and repetitive. 

D&amp;D
The one I know the least about. Needing a DM feels like the biggest drawback as our group may end up being 3 instead of 4 (one friend still to be converted to our geek ways), which means only having 2 ppl doing the adventuring which doesn't sound as fun. Because of my ignorance, I'm not sure how much is represented by models or done purely with pencil and paper. I guess another negative is learning a whole new fantasy universe and essentially having to replace all our bad guy models (if it's miniature based). We're very comfortable in the Warhammer world but I guess if the conditions were right, we'd be happy all trying something new together. 

Big inspiration for all this is not seeing my friends properly for years because of lockdown restrictions and me having 2 kids. Have to admit watching Stranger Things and seeing those guys having such a blast in their basement was very inspiring too! And lastly, I'm reading 'Dicemen' by Ian Livingstone and Steve Jackson which is an absolutely cracking book about the genesis of Games Workshop and also its influence from D&amp;D. Only a few chapters in but I'm already dying to get my D10 out and start failing those armour saves!","Differences between D&amp;D, Warhammer Quest (1995) and Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay (1986 Hogshead)?",1,self.boardgames,z0gnvj,camy252,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/z0gnvj/differences_between_dd_warhammer_quest_1995_and/,1668981610

"I teach English Language and Literature to 15 year olds (IB) here in the Netherlands, and I’m always looking for ways to make literature more approachable for my students. I promised myself I’d help these kids get a better grasp of the themes in the classic novel. There is much to be found, but it takes time and it’s important to get the kids into the “minds” of the kids on the Island. 

Now if you haven’t played Hellapagos, allow me to explain what’s going on. Hellapagos is a cooperative/competitive game where players are shipwrecked on a tropical island. In order to escape back to civilization, players will need to work together, gathering food, water and building rafts. There’s an option to not explicitly help the group by swimming out to the shipwreck and getting an “item” that they keep for themselves. Items include canned food, bottled water, guns, bullets and a plethora of other things that can shape the outcome of the game. After every player has taken an action we deduct food and water from the communal supply based on the number of surviving players. The game is designed to make it impossible for all players to survive which creates challenging situations. Alliances, backstabbing, murder, voting, drama!

I decided to do a little experiment, using two copies of “Hellapagos”. My class has 24 kids and Hellapagos can be played with 12. I explained the rules of the game and split the group into two tables of 12 players and set them off to complete a game of Hellapagos in 50 minutes, after which we would reflect. 

It started off relatively peaceful, with players eager to help out in order to maximize potential outcome. Cheers of from the groups when someone grabbed 3 food (the maximum)! Pats on the back for getting wood for making rafts! All was good… Until my students discovered that the game is rigged and you are forced to abandon morality and bonds. 

After 20 minutes it was sheer pandemonium. What started as calm, structured discussion became a cacophony of chaos! “WHY WOULD YOU SHOOT ME? I GOT FOOD LAST ROUND!” –“BUT I DON’T TRUST YOU” – “Does anyone have a bullet, because I’m gonna KILL THIS GUY!” – “GUYS PLEASE THIS ISN’T CONSTRUCTIVE!” – “I’M CHIEF! I GET TO VOTE LAST SO CHECK YOURSELF” – “DON’T WORRY I HAVE FOOD” – “BANG YOU’RE DEAD” – “WHAT WHY DID YOU DO THIS?” 

One group had their own Maffia – three students that had guns and bullets, demanded tribute from players each round in order to not be “executed”. This forced the creation of a counter-mafia, scraping loot from the wreck in the hopes of toppling the regime. 

Fellow boardgamers, I was on the floor. My sides are still recovering from the bouts of laughter as I observed the attempts made by the groups to create… something? To win… something??? The investment in the game was electric. 

Ahem. The end result: One table was able to save 5 players (a reasonable result!) the other table wasn’t that successful; the conflict between the mafia and counter-mafia ended the lives of many students: only 3 survived. Alas!

**Reflection**

After a good 10 minutes, allowing the learners to settle down and get their egos in check (some are still emotionally scarred from the experience), I started asking questions:

Everyone raise their fingers and point to the “Ralph” of the group in 3.. 2… 1.. And so students selected a “Ralph” and explained why, relating their actions in the game to the characteristics of the “Ralph” in the book. Point to the “Jack” and explain. Point to the “Piggy”, etc… The group did really well in connecting the actions of their gameplay to the characters from the book. In my setting this is a huge win. 

Then we spoke about group formation and how fear is used to control the actions of players. Just like in the book. How we naturally lean to people that are charismatic and take charge initially, but later look for security, no matter the cost. Just like in the book. 

It was an excellent experience and I'm so glad I took a chance with this experiment.","Hellapagos, Lord of the Flies and my literature classroom",1,self.boardgames,z0c7sl,DeXyDeXy,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/z0c7sl/hellapagos_lord_of_the_flies_and_my_literature/,1668970937

"My wife needs me to make a christmas list so she has some guidance. I know I want to pad out my collection a bit, so I thought I'd turn to you all for some suggestions :D

In no particular order, here are some of my favorite games and why I like them:

**Spirit Island** \- The complexity, variability and co op nature of it. I've played a few co op games and tend to like them. This is my fav tho

**Modern art** \- The bartering system is just so fun. watching peoples bets and gambles fall apart is just delightful

**Sherif of Nottingham** \- Probably one of the best bluffing games I've played

**Root** \- The asymetrical strategy nature of it is a blast. Vast is pretty solid too, but I haven't had as many runs at it

**Decrypto** \- I love the creative nature of the clues in this gameAy 

**Quacks of Quedlingburg** \- I really like the ""push your luck"" mechanic with the chance to put your thumb on the scale

**Everdale -** toss up between this and wingspan for my favorite engine/tableau builder. The theme is so fun and I like how there is a dozen completely valid ways to win

**Clank -** It's the only deck builder I have

**Cash and Guns / Wavelength** \- Just amazing party games

**Gloomhaven -**  It's gloomhaven

Games I've had my eye on but not sure about

Sleeping gods, The kings delima, Feast for odin, Too many bones, Chinatown, Detective club.

"So these came from the estate of a friend who passed away almost five years ago. These appear to be possibly(?) from two home brew games, but I don't think we have everything and thus it's currently unplayable to us. In speaking with my wife on this, I thought it might have been some pieces for a Steve Jackson-like game (akin to Car Wars).  Most of these pieces were kept in a early 1980s era Sucrets tin.

The first is a set, sorted into years (range of 1978-1981, with TWO of 1979 with different stat numbers) of what appears to be a Formula One game judging by the cars being called out. There are also two small decks of cards with effects that are clearly related. They were kept in old plastic film cans.

The second, in a film can with a scribble on the cap, appears to be a tactical hex war game in the style of the old Microgames, possibly space based.

##FAQ

**I live in Ecuador/Canada/Honduras/USA, why are you posting on a Saturday?!**

Because I'm writing this from Europe in the future where it's already Sunday. Timezones be crazy.

**Why are there a bunch of non-board games in the board game list?**

Because the Tabletop games category on Kickstarter includes anything remotely related to board games and sometimes things slip through my filters.

**Why is this future award winning board game and literal saviour of humanity missing from your list?**

Sometimes my filters get a bit overzealous and discard actually valid projects. If you feel something is missing for this reason, leave a comment and I'll add it (maybe).

**Can I donate all my money to you?**

No

**Can you help me promote my game?**

Please no. I make lists. Nothing more.

**Your list is full of errors and now Chrome is eating all my RAM!**

Indeed, this fine piece of code runs purely on thoughts and prayers, so anything can happen. Leave a comment and I'll see what I can do.

"While board gaming, we can spend hours hunched over the table looking down and often feel really sore in the back and neck.

"Hello!

My boyfriend and I love trivia games. We have a few, but I feel like they don't really help you learn trivia. It's just like, if you don't know you don't know. I was wondering if anyone knew of any trivia games that helped you really learn the trivia facts.

For example, with Trivial Pursuit, we feel like we actually retain the facts that have little blurbs after the answers. It helps put context to the question, and we can remember it more easily.

"I've created a board game several years ago and just recently started remaking it using Midjourney AI. Just wanted to share the comparisson of how the old cards looked like and how they look now. 

The language is Czech, I didn't make the game in any other localization ;D

The card is sci-fi themed. You and your friends play as exiles trying to run away from the law. It is a cooperative roguelike experience where each person controls his own ship, collects ship parts, specialists and tries to get as many people on board as well as keep them alive (people count is both score and life).

These cards are locations that you can traverse through. Every in-game day you encounter a random location that determines what can you do and what affects you the next 5 turns (5 events) before you move on.

The first card are Astral Gardens that make you gain extra Organic material when you gain any.

"Hello!! Sorry about any grammar mistakes, english is not my native language! 

So I'm about to start Pandemic Legacy season 2. I play mainly with my wife and something is worrying me.

Winning is important to her. Too important, specially in cooperative games. And I'm afraid that the game can't be as fun to her because of that. I might be overreacting to some infos I got online about people not finding ""something important at the beginning"" and losting a lot of months in a row. 

I really want to avoid getting into something too difficult and ruining our fun together. 

To be clear, there's no problem in losing, but high difficulties will kill her joy. I don't want this to happen, I just wanna live through the campaign experience without frustrations because of many defeats in a row. 

So I ask: can someone give me some tips, with as little spoilers as possible, on how to act and what parts of the map I should explore at the beginning?

"Hello!

Hubby and I moved this year and our new circle of gamers prefer co-op, or at least an element of co-op, style games. I own 3, and so far the top favorites that we come to over and over are Dead Men Tell No Tales and AH Rear Window. They're both vastly different but both offer the element of teamwork. 

DMTNT is strictly co-op, where you each are a pirate with a special ability trying to explore an enemy pirate ships and loot as much treasure as required for the number of players as you can before the bad things happen. Like your normal co-op, there are many ways to lose, and only one way to win. This game has a board building element much like Betrayal at House on the Hill (the 3rd co-op game I own) or the Fog Island scenario in Seafarers where each turn that player grabs a new pirate ship tile and decides where to place it so we can continue exploring the ship. It is a lot of fun, you very much work together and learn each other's abilities so you can set the next person up for a better try during your turn. For instance, if one player is Jade, she can eliminate deckhands better than any other player so you may as well not worry about that on your turn and maybe focus on your strength or maybe giving her some of your AP tokens so she can move to a room with deckhands. 

Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window is more like Betrayal where there is a person who knows things (the Director, in this case), one could say a Game Master, so to speak, and everybody else is working together to figure it out or beat the Director. But there is a way the Director wins, a way the players win, and a way they all lose or win. This game is almost like a more complicated Mastermind (you know, that colored peg code-breaking game you played when you were 11) with a little bit of a Clue flavor thrown in there. It isn't super detailed necessarily and the mechanics are not complicated or numerous at all, but it is fun. 

So, that said... I'm looking for more co-op ish style type games that I could get for Christmas or in the coming months so we have a few more options in the rotation. The group definitely tends to like less complicated, less strategy type, and more teamwork type. I, personally like a fun strong narrative and lottsssss of strategy, but hey I'll take anything if it means I get to sit down and play a board game.

For context: this is a vanilla, church-going, tater tot casserole-loving midwestern bunch who don't like overly haunty, dark, sci fi type themes. If that helps. I literally got the Scooby Doo version of Betrayal for that reason alone. I have Disney Villainous and some expansions, and they do like the Disney Haunted Mansion game but that's probably as far as we get fam. Lovecraftian stuff or anything along those lines is probably a no-go... But mysteries! Sherlockian type stuff is a yes!

Finally got a lot of my kickstarters in after the months of pandemic delay! Was super excited to get both **Pax Pamir** and **John Company** in, along with **Carnegie** and the newest **Root** expansion!

Since the last time I made one of these posts, my favorites have gotten jumbled up a lot. **Pax** is fantastic and easily my favorite war game. Have not played **John Company** yet but plan to do it over Thanksgiving. **Orléans** has become our fav pure euro game, fills a similar niche to **Castles of Burgundy** but much easier to set up and has more consistent action. The new **Root** expansion is fantastic and really makes the game better at two. **Trickerion** has one of the best theme integrations I've ever seen, and isn't super tough to learn despite how deep it is.  I really like the mechanics of **Corrosion**, but the pacing is just a bit wonky. Luckily it has rules for a faster game, and its very easy to house rule a couple better pacing tweaks.  

How long:  I've been building this collection for 5 ish years now, started off with the usual **Catan** and **Betrayal**, and went down the rabbit hole from there!

Things I would change:  Not that much, honestly.  We're running out of space now so I'd  be willing to let a couple games go like **Carnival of Monsters**, **Munchkin**, maybe **Arkright: the card game** (sadly awful at anything other than 4 players, and i think i just prefer the full version)**,** and add in some more Uwe, Vital Lacerda, and maybe something like **Too Many Bones**, or like one big minins on a map type game.  Some more co-op games would be good, but I really dislike the quarterback prone ones.  We have a really good mix of party, medium, and heavy games though, so until something new comes out that seems very interesting I am super happy with where the collection is at for now.

Top 5:

**Root**

**Pax Pamir**

**Pipeline**

**Coffee Traders**

**Wavelength**

Shelf of Shame:

**John Company** (should be played shortly, just needed enough people)

**Carnegie**

**1846** (that was an aspirational purchase, I'm not sure it will ever get played)

"There should be a national competition, where the council selects 30 games. The games are historically significant, or supremely popular or more ubiquitous.

Over the year, the competitors practice those 30 games. 

When they get to the competition, the organizers pick 6 or so of those games at random. That's what the competition is going to be. And then there is a tournament of those 6 games to determine the board game champion.

After a few games, our heads are all collectively starting to grok the game somewhat. We're going to welcome two new players this week who have never played.

"Today playing Clank in Space! Ended the game with no damage and a thin deck that would cycle through every 2 turns. I had multiple cards that would draw, loot (draw and discard) and trash cards (remove them from the deck). 

It made me think of deck-thinning and how non-intuitive it is to newer players. Players can understand trashing an actively bad card like Stumble (+1 clank) from their deck, but are often reticent to eliminate a card like Trophy Hunter (-2 clank) that they see as a resource. 

And it made me think of other non-intuitive strategies mechanics. 

For instance, games with lots of dice rolls are often perceived to be highly random, when the truth is the more dice rolled the less random it is. Armello (video game) and King of New York are stellar examples.

So I will start the ball rolling with those 2 examples and see what others you all can think of.

+ More dice = less random

# About Ranstax

Ranstax enables you to play board games like Wingspan, Everdell and Carcassonne with separate stacks for each expansion or module. This means a simpler and shorter setup, less shuffling and more modularity! All expansions and modules can remain separated, *forever*!

# How does Ranstax work?

Just select the stacks to play with, shuffle them separately, and use Ranstax whenever you have to draw any number of items. *It's that easy!*

It helps if you mark your stacks, e.g. by putting a specific colour game component (e.g. an unused resource token or meeple) next to each. Then enter the stack names and sizes in Ranstax using an emoji that matches the marked stack. For example for Wingspan plus expansions:

💙 North America: 180 (170 + 10 from the Swift Start pack)  
💜 Europe: 81  
💛 Oceania: 95  
❤️ Asia: 90

&gt;💡 The colours of the heart emojis can match the egg colours (Wingspan has egg components). Put one matching egg besides each stack!  
&gt;  
&gt;💡 To type emojis in Ranstax, press \[Ctrl\]\[.\] (period) on Windows or \[⌃\]\[⌘\]\[space\] on macOS.

Whenever you need to draw anything during game setup or the game, you just press a number button in Ranstax to draw that many. Ranstax will randomly draw from every stack, taking into account their changing sizes like in a real mixed deck! The history tells you what stacks items were drawn from and you simply draw from them.

&gt;💡 For super simple control of Ranstax, you can also press a number key on your computer's keyboard, if you have a keyboard at hand!

# What can you and I do to improve Ranstax?

Please give Ranstax a few tries. Congratulations, you're an early adopter now!

For example, you could try the following:

* Try different devices (e.g. laptop, tablet, phone, etc.).
* Share your opinion after a few games using Ranstax.
* Give me feedback. You can do that here, or see the links on the bottom of the Ranstax page.
* If you know about other games for which Ranstax might work well, let me know! These are usually games with many different stacks/piles/sets/decks of modular content that normally must be shuffled together. I know that e.g. Wingspan, Everdell and Carcassonne are good examples.
* Please note that Ranstax is brand new and may have issues or miss features that are important to you. I'm open to all suggestions and contributions.
* ❗️ Have fun ❗️

Thank you for being a player, contributor or supporter! ❤️ 🎲 🃏 🍀

# Questions

Q: What about discard piles, if any?  
A: Keep them separate too. Just put discarded items next to the corresponding draw pile. This way all stacks can remain separated when packing up the game.

Q: How is the shuffling faster/easier if I have to now shuffle multiple smaller stacks separately?  
A: See [this discussion](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2969221) about shuffling large numbers of cards. Summary: properly shuffling decks becomes much harder with increasing deck size, so the smaller the decks, the faster it becomes, especially if you have multiple smaller decks. The added value is also in not having to ever (un)merge your decks again!

Q: Wouldn't drawing from a specific pile reveal information about the drawn item?  
A: Yes and no. You know from which set the item comes, but what does that really tell you? It's only one of many possible items. I don't recommend using Ranstax with stacks of fewer than, say, 10 items, because of this reason. However, if the stack is just 10 items or less, it would be as simple to not use Ranstax and just shuffle these items with another stack to form a big enough one. Also, in some games this doesn't even matter, e.g. in Carcassonne where a drawn tile is immediately revealed.

Got other questions? Let me know in a reply and I might edit this post to include them here. 😀

"I recently got an update from the Gamefound campaign for Bot Factory and realized, suddenly, it doesn't have any cards. Everything is cardboard tiles, meeples, tokens.

I had a weird feeling opening Clans of Caledonia and seeing the same thing....no cards. Even the player aid was on chipboard.

I think it's more noticeable when cards are missing the ""bigger"" the game is. Even more so if it's not an ""abstract"" game.

Looking at my \~40x game collection, I'm seeing that nearly every game I have save for the below, has some form of cards. (7/40)

"So I've tried memoir 44 a few times now, and every time it seems it all comes down to luck. First game I absolutely trounced my friend, even if he was in a better position and in cover. I hit on almost all my dice rolls, while he missed on all his. 

Second game I had 6 cards, but 5 of the cards where all move on the right sector (of which I had one unit, which was eliminated pretty quickly). Rest of the game for me was just playing the one card that allowed me to move the other units. Meaning I made no decisions as to what to play. I had no choice. Still, my dice rolling was supremely lucky, while my friend was equally unlucky. 

Also, how does Axis get points? In the scenarios it only says how the Allies get extra points. Is the Axis just supposed to kill as many units as possible? The first scenario in the rule book tells me to hold two positions (bridges) and earn a point for every round. The right side of the map is easily taken by the Allies, and then I just have to wait it out and avoid fighting with Axis? And if he rushes his units to that side of the board to retake it, the other side is now an easy target. I checked the other scenarios, and they all say how the Allies can get extra points. The whole game seems skewed against Axis as well. Air superiority card is weaker if you're axis as well. 

Really disappointed in this game, it all feels way to lucky.

"I've named a game mechanism that (to my knowledge) has not yet had a suitable name.  The Hiking Trail mechanism, as I call it, is the one found in Tokaido and Francis Drake.  
To review what it is, it's a game mechanism where all players move along a path or track, and can only move forwards. Generally they can move as far as they want and stop at an empty action space they want and take the action. However, players behind on the path must catch up and pass your piece before you get another turn. 

Similar to hiking a trail, you hike ahead and stop at something to look at and wait for everyone to catch up.  You don't want to go backwards, as that's counterproductive, and exhausting.  You go forwards on the trail until you see something you want to stop at, like a waterfall, rock outrcropping, picnic table...etc.  You wait until your hiking group catches up before you start moving again, giving yourself time to rest.

"Ethnos is a very cool game in my opinion. It scales rather well 2-6, and is the best area control gateway game I have found. For being so simple it provides interesting decision and rewards skill.

My only issue with Ethnos is that the game eventually devolves into a top-decking battle where the initial market is dried up and RNG then becomes a bigger factor in who draws the cards they need and subsequently wins (assuming fairly equally skilled players).

Are there any variants that help address this issue? Have you found ways to mitigate this issue?

Also: are there other low weight area control/dudes on map style games that you think address the same niche as Ethnos and do equally as well or better?",Games like Ethnos and fixing the top-decking problem,1,self.boardgames,yya78f,Yhelfman,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/yya78f/games_like_ethnos_and_fixing_the_topdecking/,1668743052

"I'm having some family come up for a few days for Thanksgiving and I wanted to see if anyone had some suggestions for games that could support up to 10 players. I really appreciate any suggestions! (I'm not quite sure if everyone would want to play all the time so it may be between 8-10 people wanting to play a game at any given time)

Of the games I have right now that might work well right now I've got **Codenames**, **Cards Against Humanity**, **Wits and Wagers** (but not sure if it would support 10 people as I don't have the family edition) and I have a **Crokinole** board so I was thinking a little tourney could be fun (though not sure how to best set that up yet tbh), I also might get some more dice and cups for **Perudo**.

Then I was considering buying another game or two that would be fun for everyone, preferably nothing too heavy as it'll be a big group of people who have mostly just played standard family games

I was thinking of getting a deception game but I haven't played any before myself, would it be better to go for **Ultimate Werewolf**, **One Night Ultimate Werewolf**, **Mafia**, **Secret Hitler**, or **The Resistance**? ONUW was gonna be my pick but I worry about people feeling left out if they get eliminated?

And I was reading that **Dixit Odyssey** can support 12 players, would that be a good pick?

And **Exploding Kittens Party** crossed my mind as well

"I went to a small board game con last weekend, and I was torn because I played a lot of games in a genre I don't normally gravitate to, the ""I have my own player board"" stuff. Specifically I played Dice Hospital, Cascadia, and Evergreen.

All those games are great puzzles. Trying to figure out how you're going to make plays to get points (or save lives) is satisfying, and I want to play them again, but also I don't.

Because even though they're great puzzles, I hesitate to call them great games. All three of them work on the idea that the ONLY interaction you're going to have with other players is that there's a big shop in the middle that you and the other players draw from, and somebody might take something before you. So if somebody is doing well, there's functionally nothing you can do to stop them. We're basically just playing four games of solitaire next to one another, and while solitaire is fun, I want to play board games for the interaction.

Is this a feeling anybody else in the board game sphere has? Are there other people who think that games with personal player boards like Welcome To, Agricola, Railroad Ink, and a bunch of others aren't really... games? Maybe it's OK to have limited interaction and still be considered a great game, but I feel like that misses a large part of the whole hobby. It's like the only reason other people are playing is so you have an audience to watch you win.

I dunno.

"Hi, folks!  
I am in the middle of designing fast and minimalistic (deck of only one type of cards) card game for a pub environment, and I need your help to think of some dares that are ...well... daring, yet legal in semi-public space, and not overly childrish, alcoholic or sexual. I already know, that it probably will be adults-only game (yes, I already have few slightly sexual dares) but I'd like to keep those as borderline examples:

* ""perform cunilingus to an empty glass""
* ""sensually ride a chair for 30 seconds""

Also there are few drinking dares, but always are doable with non-alcoholic drink or some snack. Originally I have planned to sort the dares into theme packs of full decks, and make the game easilly expandable, but as I seem to struggle to put together even the first deck, I'll probably mix it all up into that only one.

 Game mechanics seems promising, but I am really out of ideas on the dares front. Any ideas I could use? I've got 15 dare cards out of 54, and I am stuck... 😔 

Also hinting another combination to a rock-scissors-paper would be useful (something like chainmail - wraps rock and dulls scissors, etc.), but I need whole 2nd lvl prop types system which would be game-wise more expensive and more powerfull, yet balanced across all combinations...

"I hope this kind of post is okay. I've been a huge fan of board games for the last decade or so, but the one thing I've yet to really experience is Board Game Cafes. I've had a couple come through my city, but kinda missed out on them for various reasons. Now, I've recently been brought on to manage one, and I have bar/restaurant management experience, and my passion for gaming, but what I lack is the knowledge of what sets a good board game cafe apart from the rest.  


So, if people don't mind, the questions I'd like to ask are:  
1.) How often do you go to board game cafes?  
2.) What do you like about going there?  
3.) What don't you like about going there?

4.) What would you change/like to see, if anything else?  


Ultimately, my goal isn't to squeeze a bunch of money out of people or something like that; I just want to create a cool place where people can come hang out, play their favourite games, and maybe meet some new people in the process.   


Again, I hope it's okay to post this here; I know there are other methods of doing market research, I just figured I'd get some feedback from different people across the world, and I know this community is both very passionate and honest about our hobby, so this felt like the best place to start.",Board Game Cafe Research,1,self.boardgames,yxz8oe,TheBigPointyOne,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/yxz8oe/board_game_cafe_research/,1668713602

So what are your favorite games that 'fix' effective elimination?

I just started planning my 12 boardgame challenges for 2023. Most of them are pretty easy to create but this one has me stumped.

I remember seeing a video or picture of it here or on bgg some years ago. Per the title, there were 4 players playing 4 games on a massive table (i think at a con or smthg). Each player took a turn and moved to the next game in a merry go round fashion. 

My questions are:

Does anyone here have any experience running an event of this nature? If so what were the games you used?


What kind of games mechanisms should I look for when choosing games? (Euros, low/no player interaction? Multiplayer solitaire?)

"I just need to rant for a minute.

People. Don't back expensive Kickstarters if you are not prepared to pay for the actual shipping costs. You look like an entitled baby when you rant in the comments at a first time independent board game creator about how shocked and angry you are they the $130 14kg box you ordered a year ago costs more than half that to arrive at your door. It shouldn't be a surprise anymore. Assume it when you back, and plan for it. Or. Don't. Back. It. 

Yeah, it sucks. We're all watching our hard-earned money evaporate because greedy sociopaths are milking a global pandemic to price gouge consumers. But your indie game developer cutting out proptypes at their kitchen table after dinner is most likely not one of them, so STOP TAKING IT OUT ON THEM. 

They don't want to charge you that much. But they don't have the relationships with logistics partners, and the number of backers, and the experience with manufacturing, and the prescience to predict the future state of the economy, needed to negotiate and predict  the best rate 12-18 months ahead of time. 

If you can't pay $75 to $100 shipping for a $150 board game that weighs as much as a 4-month old baby, you shouldn't be backing the game. At this point, being surprised that you have to actually pay a lot to ship a giant box of plastic is on you, not on the creator.

"Like many of you on this subreddit, I experienced a honeymoon stage of modern board game discovery sometime in 2015-16,  and went on a bit of a purchasing binge.

Over the years, my wife and I have amassed a pretty solid collection of games ranging from light to decently heavy (but not wargame heavy 😄). Some of our heavier stuff includes Polis, Terraforming Mars, Feast for Odin, Scythe, Sekigahara, and Brass Birmingham.

And it was during a recent (vs AI) playthrough of Brass that I was thinking about the sheer depth of the game, and that it would likely take hundreds of plays to realize the game from a position of ""full understanding"" and play it at a high level. I mean, games of a certain complexity usually take at least 2-3 plays simply for the rules to be fully internalized and edge cases understood.

And it just got me thinking about all of the games that probably deserve a hundred plays but won't get them simply due to time. It's almost as if games of a certain depth (I would say maybe games above a 3.0, maybe 3.5 weight on BGG?) necessitate being lifestyle games if you want to experience everything they have to offer.

How many heavier games do you all own? Do you run into similar issues of feeling like you're only getting a taste of what the game has to offer simply due to a lack of meaningful playthroughs?","The Brass Birmingham Dilemma, or Why You Should Own Fewer Games",1,self.boardgames,yxi4oq,hereforthedepravity,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/yxi4oq/the_brass_birmingham_dilemma_or_why_you_should/,1668664443

"Long story short there's a board game I played with an ex a few times that I really liked, I would like to get it/play it again but I forgot what it was called.

Here's what I remember of it: it was a Kickstarter, and the Kickstarter version had 3d model characters but iirc the non-kickstarter didn't (or wouldn't, not sure if it got off Kickstarter). Each player picked one of a handful of hero characters, but one person would be the villain. The board was made up of tikes that were large rectangular pieces with terrain on them, the center ones were the same every time but the outer ones randomized. In the early game the villain player would summon monsters around the board and the heros would fight them while exploring, there were 3 (?) Shrines to discover that would all reduce the villains starting health and if all 3 were found you would skip to the end phase where they would directly fight him. You had melee/ranged/magic as skills to add and got stars based on what you killed to level up with.

It was in kind of a goofy/funny style. The heros I remember are a goblin bard, a  big warrior guy, and an elf with an ugly horse (the horse was specifically said to be ugly in the lore I'm not just making fun of it lol)

	* How is the winner determined?
	* why will you like this game? Which is the fun part?
	* Advanced
		* how are the game mechanics connected with each other?

For me, the Heroes and Hexes expansion for Quest for El Dorado would have fit this category.

"I am developing a new board game and working on a battle system right now. I got with the following idea.

There are battle tokens in the game with different face values (for example: 1, 3, 5 and 10). But all tokens look the same from behind. These tokens represent the soldiers.

Attacking player can put some battle tokens on the battlefield. Defending player sees the number of put tokens, but does not know their values, and he puts some battle tokens in a response. After that all tokens are turned over.

If the attacking player has greater total value, he conquers the land. Then all participated tokens go to the bank (lost for players).

Looks pretty simple, yeah?

&amp;#x200B;

Example 1

Attacking player puts token with 1 soldier. Defending player is really scared and decides to not defend at all. In this case, attacking player conquers the land and loses just 1 soldier.

&amp;#x200B;

Example 2

Attacking player puts token with 1 soldier. Defending player puts token with 5 soldiers. In this case, attacking player does NOT conquer the land, but defending player loses much more soldiers (5 vs 1).

&amp;#x200B;

Example 3

Attacking player puts token with 1 soldier. Defending player puts token with 1 soldier. In this case, attacking player does NOT conquer the land, and each player loses one soldier.

&amp;#x200B;

This is not a final solution yet, but the rough idea. For example, I think it may be useful to give some bonus for defending player. I have two questions:

1) Does this battle system look interesting to you?

2) Do you know any games with similar mechanics?",Battle system,1,self.boardgames,ywyfl7,Shuvzero,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/ywyfl7/battle_system/,1668616556

"Hey all. Over on my Arkham Horror LCG site i did something that might be better served here in the more general board game sub than in the AHLCG one. I went through my collection of soloable board games and ranked them by how much i like them for solo.

This is also for a big part a COMC post, so i tagged it as such here. The subreddit rules tell me to answer two questions when posting a COMC, so i will do so of course!

&gt; How long have you been involved in the hobby?

I've been into pen and paper RPGs since very, very early. Then Magic the Gathering for a long while. I guess i consider myself a board game hobbyist for 10ish years, but the roots go at least 20-25 years back to the likes of BattleTech and HeroQuest.

&gt; What would you change about your collection if you could? 

I am quite happy with it, so very little. I suppose the biggest ""regrets"" are two of my all-in Kickstarters. I payed way too much for Aventuria just based off of nostalgia for the theme. And i own waaay too much Too Many Bones for how little i play it.

" Hello everyone!

I present to you, my first video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzvQ\_gf3ZiE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzvQ_gf3ZiE)

You might remember me from my post about a week ago asking if there was interest in new Go content for the community. Well, I took all of your advice and opinions to heart and decided to go for it. This is my first time making YouTube content like this, and I'm excited to begin the process. This is going to be a learning experience for me, and hopefully an entertaining and informative process for you.

We're out here like Ash Ketchum leaving his Mom's house for the first time. My Pikachu is level 10k and the road ahead is full of tough opponents. However, I will be the very best and one day Akira Toya will finally recognize ME as his true rival.

Until then, I am excited to present this new series to you today. My goal is to work with the community and grow stronger alongside you all. I am currently 10k, but the goal is to reach 1 Dan. I know I can get there, so let's work together and start the journey today.

"I’m sure this has been asked a million times but I am struggling to find applicable threads…

Like probably everyone here, I love board games. I don’t even care about winning, I just love the aspect of playing a game with friends. Unfortunately I feel like everyone I know that is into board games is more of a passive gamer, and loves them in theory but doesn’t really play games that often. Whereas I could be happy playing a game every other day. 

I completely respect how everyone enjoys games - this is not a knock on anyone for their rate of play. I do wish that I knew how to encourage those that love board games to actually play them more often, though. I don’t find one-player board games as enjoyable, unfortunately, because I love the round-table aspect of working with or against others for fun. 

The main argument against is that there is so much work going into it (setup, time, learning/re-learning rules) …Are there any ways you can think of to encourage others who like board games to integrate playing more regularly into their week?",Advice on encouraging passive gamers to play more often?,1,self.boardgames,ywve2f,theunithasasoul,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/ywve2f/advice_on_encouraging_passive_gamers_to_play_more/,1668610004
"Well, I pulled Dice Forge off the shelf for the first time last night, as I had been eagerly trying to find the opportunity.  I watched some videos on it before i bought and thought, ""What an interesting concept, this must be a lot of fun.""

Well I must have forgotten to remove my rose glasses, because this is the first game I regret having on my shelf since I started this hobby.  It takes too long to set up, the rounds feel shallow and repetitive, and who wins is largely random and arbitrary.  The worst thing about it though, is resetting the dice on cleanup. It's super annoying to have to pry the faces off in order to put the old ones back. I think the concept is neat for sure, but the effort involved in setup and cleanup is not worth it to me for what the game brings.

"I really want to find a set group of people to game with. 

I’ve attended meet ups in the past but I haven’t really had any luck. I remember a post here a while ago saying that it’s hard to find a private group at a meet up because the majority of the people at the meetups are the people that lack social skills and people don’t really want to play with them privately. 

It seems like I don’t really mesh well with most people at these meetups, maybe that’s on me. I’ve just encountered so many sore losers, cheaters, backseat gamers, people with bad hygiene, I’m starting to lose hope.

"My friend and I spent 2 weeks turning her house into a winter wasteland for a special RPG sesh this Saturday. We hired lighting and furniture, made ration packs for snacks and made more paper icicles than I care to count. Naturally our poor GM got covid. 

So as not to waste our hard work (and equipment hire) we’re doing a winter nightmare themed board game sesh instead. Any recommendations for games would be very appreciated.

"Hi there,
I am tinkering on my own board game and so far I enjoy the process. All people who tested it liked it so I want to try to publish it someday.

One thing im thinking about is, what type of player tokens most would prefer.

So I want to start a little discussion what you like and why you like it.

Personally I enjoy to play with big and well painted miniatures. I have a big collection of Warhammer figures and a couple of miniature heavy board games. But these miniatures make the games way more expensive and the boxes need way more storage and usually the board game itself needs to bei bigger too. And many people dont like or dont have the time to paint everything.

Meeples on the other hand are super cheap and are usually easy to distinguish in the board. For most board games meeples work perfekt and I don't mind at all, if a game uses meeples or tokens.

Last but not least you could use standees as a middle ground between costs, size and looks. I think standees are are good for games with loot of different tokens or miniatures. For a game like Carcassonne these would be unneccessary.

I think meeples work well enough for my idea, because each player needs only one token to present himself. A standee or a miniature should be below 5 cm in height, otherwise the game board and the game box needs to be bigger. And if I will publish this game someday I would prefer it to be as cheap as possible so more people will play it.","Miniature, Standee or only Meeples",1,self.boardgames,ywnwxn,Haunting-Ad4227,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/ywnwxn/miniature_standee_or_only_meeples/,1668586891

"**WARNING, WALL OF WORDS BELOW.**

The hope with sharing all this info is that it'll help someone make a purchasing decision or start a conversation about what people do and don't like about certain games.
**Story Time:**

In late 2021 and early 2022 my wife and I came into about 30 new board games through various means and methods, ballooning our collection to over 100 games in a short timespan. We also had a handful of games on the way via pre-order or Kickstarter. We've been board gaming since about 2016 and in that time steadily added games at a conservative pace and very rarely removed some from our collection, so this massive wave of new games at such a fast rate caused us to re-evaluate our entire collection and collecting habits going forward. In April 2022, we decided to get a bigger shelf and vowed to keep our collection below an arbitrary number of 100 games and to ***only keep games that we love to play, are excited to play every time, and are excited to show people.***

That mindset to keep the count below 100 and to purge any game that didn't generally excite us, meant we had to start evaluating our collection. We immediately pulled aside a massive stack of games of 15 games that we just fell out of love with or actually didn't like at all, and we even led to us purging games we had just gotten in late 2021. We set another goal to play every board game we own and to determine what should stay and what should go. The last few months we added another large stack of 15 or so games to be purged. We just successfully traded away the final game we wanted to remove and now we're sitting at 86 games owned with 2 Kickstarters waiting to be fulfilled. 

We just had our own little retrospective and I felt invigorated to post on here, so hopefully some of you find this insightful at least entertaining!

**The List:**

Without further ado, here is the list of games! There'll be a column for the combined number plays we had of each game, what we each rated it on BGG, and our reasoning.

Game | # of Plays | His Rating | Her Rating | Reasoning | 
---|---|----|----|----|----
5-Minute Mystery | 8 | 6.0 | 6.0 | The game is fine but simply fails at being challenging or having any sort of real mystery. Zero logic, deductive reasoning, or strategic thinking is required for the game. Ultimately it's a real time game of where's waldo and while the moment to moment gameplay loop is easy to enjoy, and there's a nice variety of missions, the game never felt truly challenging or rewarding. After finishing a game we just sort of had this bland ""That was a game."" feeling lol | 
Between Two Cities | 5 | 7.5 | 7 | We actually quite enjoy this one and love the ""cooperatively competitive"" gameplay style but after just a few plays we lost any excitement to play it again or to show it off to others. We liked the mechanics a lot so are on the hunt for similar games | 
Carcassonne | 13 | 7.5 | 7.5 | We actually regret getting rid of this one haha we gifted it to a friend getting into the hobby and find ourselves missing the puzzly area-control feel of the game. | 
Caverna: The Cave Farmers | 7 | 7.5 | 5.5 | I personally really wanted to like this game and loved the theme, and even played several games solo to find reasons to keep it for myself. My wife could care less about the theme and found the whole experience exhausting. The game has so many things going against it that I think others should consider before picking it up: It's a large box with components for up to 8 players but does not play quickly at any player count at easily 45+ minutes per player. The game is very open ended and sandboxy, with countless parallel paths to victory possible each game, which might sound great for some people, but for both of us that meant never being sure what to do or worse, that you never focus and fall hysterically behind on points. We played a game with 4 people that took almost 5 miserable hours with the teach and halfway through the game we realized that of all the possible actions and upgrades we could take, more than half of them NONE of us would want during that particular game, so it just felt frustrating to have the heap of stuff taking up table space. We think this game is perfect for some people, but the size, space it takes up, sandbox-nature, and game length are big issues for us. | 
Chronicles of Crime | 4 | 4.0 | 3.5 | Man, this game was bad lol we went in very excited and eager to fall in love. We saw the SUSD review and have had the game recommended to us by others who know we enjoy the EXIT series of games. Hooboy, we did not like this game, like at all. Firstly, we have no issue with app integrated games, but with this one where you use your phone to scan cards on the board and then look at the results on the phone (or tablet) it was hard for more than one person to ever comfortably see what was being revealed or looked at, leaving the other people twiddling their thumbs for much of the game. Also, and most damning, was that we played through 4 scenarios and never once felt like any sort of critical thinking or logical deduction was required because you could just brute force your way through every scenario by scanning and talking to everyone. Sure, there's a time mechanism to limit what you can do but it never felt organically challenging. And finally, 3 of 4 of the scenarios we did had comically bad writing and just completely unsatisfying structure to the plot or their resolutions. We both strongly do not recommend the game. | 
Crew: The Quest for Planet Nine | 8 | 6.5 | 4.0 | After one play of this game my wife asked to not play it again haha as you'll read with other games below, she does not like real time games or co-op games without open communication just as a rule of thumb, and this one is both. Personally I don't care for trick taking at all but was very impressed with its implementation here. I played it a few more times with other groups and zero people had much more to say other than ""That was neat, but I'd rather play something else."" We considered keeping it because we know their are mega fans of it out there but ultimately neither of us nor our regular play groups cared for it. | 
Dixit | 31 | 8.0| 7.0 | Another game we kind of regret removing from our collection. This is one of the first games we ever got and fell in love with, and we likely have played it way more times than we have logged. Ultimately we only enjoy this game at 4+ players and any time we had that many people to sit and play some light hearted games we found ourselves reaching for other games. We gifted this to a family friend who has kids just the right age to get a lot of love out of it. | 
Downforce | 3 | 6.0 | 6.5 | We picked this one up at Target during a 30% sale and we both quite enjoyed it but every time we reached for it to set up or show others, we just lost any excitement. It's not a bad game but it's just a step or two past too dry and simple of gameplay for what the game is. The gameplay of blocking people on the track was satisfying so we'll keep an out for a similar game but perhaps more variable/asymmetric player powers and more interesting/wild tracks would really elevate the game. (A mario kart theme mayhaps?) | 
Empyreal: Spells &amp; Steam | 2 | 7.5 | 6.0 | The newest game on our list, we just picked it up in September 2022. I really liked the game but my wife and the friends we played with, while impressed with the mechanics, did not like the presentation and were overwhelmed by the sandbox nature. The game is huge both on the shelf and on the table and setup (even with nifty gametrayz) takes way too long. I found the sandbox features to be just at the sweet spot for me, but there's undoubtedly a lot of possibilities every turn and it can feel overwhelming and like you're never making the right choice. There's A LOT to love in the game, and the anime-esque presentation is love or hate it, and I'm highly impressed with the mechanics and design, but ultimately the game would never get played so we traded it away this week.  | 
Everdell: Mistwood + Pearlbrook + Spirecrest  | 2 of each | - | - | We love Everdell and already own and love the Bellfaire expansion. If we had to make top 10 lists, both of us would have Everdell on it and I'd have it in my top 3. With that in mind, we got a late pledge of the ""Complete Collection"" and it arrived late September. We decided to sit down and play one game of Everdell Core + 1 expansion and what we found is that we vastly prefer the core mechanics, gameplay loop, and most importantly, decision space of Core Everdell. We really did not like Pearlbrook or Mistwood primarily because they added to the decision space whilst not adding to the core mechanics at all, so the new boards and rules felt like something you had to go all-in with interacting or none at all. Not to mention that those two expansions really just slowed the game down. Mistwood is a fine co-op mode but neither of us are fans of ""bot"" solo/co-op in the least as they're always so fiddly and we always get halfway through a game to realize we missed a rule or 5 lol Also the complete collection storage box is absolutely batshit insane, like the biggest box we've ever had even beating Roll Player Adventure! Having said all that, we loved Newleaf even though it adds a side board it more than makes up for that by just feeling like an advanced forest location instead of a whole new game mechanism. Also Newleaf and Mistwood both add tons of new cards and events that we've fused into the core game and won't play without. We ended up trading away Pearlbrook + Spirecrest + The Collectors Box without much issue but have Mistwood hidden away in our closet since we took out the new core deck cards from it. If you like Everdell the base game and just want more of that, we highly recommend picking up both Bellfaire and Newleaf and just using the new deck cards, events, and end-game scoring goals, which is what we'll be doing going forward. Likely only using the Newleaf train station once in awhile. | 
Fantastic Factories (with Manufactions expansion) | 10 | 8.5 | 7.5 | We really like this game and have no real criticisms or negatives. It's fun to play, quick to setup, easy to teach, and has quite a bit of depth. What it came down to was that when we were in the mood to play a game like Fantastic Factories, we would rather play Wingspan, Valeria: Card Kingdoms, or Roll for the Galaxy. I think what holds back Fantastic Factories is its rather simple and dry theme and presentation; while it's presented well with great graphic design and fun art style, the theme doesn't really come through and the presentation isn't excellent compared to similar games. | 
Flashpoint | 5 | 7.5 | 7.5 | We quite liked this game but it was sharing similar game space as some of our other favorite co-op games, Atlantis Rising, Forbidden Island/Desert, Pandemic, and the Captain is Dead. We love playing co-op games and showing them to new people, but Flashpoint was in this awkward space where we wouldn't show it to a new-to-the-hobby player but also not meat/interesting enough to warrant being picked over Atlantis Rising or the Captain is Dead. The theme, premise, and presentation of Flashpoint is great so it was a hard game to part with. | 
Forbidden Sky | 5 | 6.0 | 7.0 | Much of what I said about Flashpoint can be said about Forbidden Sky, but with the added negative that the game is just way too easy. We never once struggled with Forbidden Sky and as such lost any excitement to play it. Also it unreasonably bothers us that this game came in a cardboard box whilst the previous two games in the ""Forbidden Series"" came in nice tin boxes! It was a fun game to experience, especially after our love for the previous Forbidden games, but there's not enough in the game to keep on our shelves or pulling out. | 
Galaxy Trucker | 8 | 7.0 | 5.5 | Much like the Crew, after our first play of this, my wife turned me to and asked to never play it again. The chaotic unpredictable, unfair, and real time design of the game is a very interesting sell to any player. I personally really enjoyed it and could get into the mindset that this is a silly ride and I'm just excited to be riding it. But for my wife and other people we showed, the frenetic and wild nature of it was hard to get into, especially in a competitive game. I did get my wife to play a few more times with me and she did admit to enjoying it a bit more, but it made her too stressed and frustrated to ever be happy to play the game. |
Game of Thrones: The Board Game | 8 | 8.5 | N/A | This was the hardest game to part with for me as I've had some of my best board gaming moments and memories playing this game, but ultimately I refuse to play it with less than 6 players and my wife refuses to play cutthroat-war games at all. The game group I got all my plays with live far away from me now as we moved states and our new groups are also against cutthroat-war-games. I've been lugging the game with me for 3 years with zero plays and it came down to the fact that even if I did get a group to sit down to play a political war game, I'd rather play Cosmic Encounters, The King is Dead, Inis, or Root over a Game of Thrones. Also I think the theme is great and execution of the themes in the books is phenomenal, but if you're not a fan of the books or show, there are much better political war games out there. | 
Glass Road | 3 | 8.0 | 6.0 | Plain and simple reasoning her; I loved the game but my wife and no one we play with care for the theme or premise in the slightest. The solo mode doesn't interest me at all and so I'm not going to hold on to it or any game with the hopes that one day I'll find some players/friends that can enjoy, or at least be neutral, on the theme/premise of the game. Amazing action selection and ""rondel"" mechanisms in the game, definitely strong recommend to anyone who can get behind the the themes! Probably my favorite Uwe game I've played if that matters for anyone. | 
Initiative | 21 | 7.5 | 7.5 | Another simple explanation here, we played all there is to play with zero interest in the ""standard"" game mode. If you didn't know the Initiative is basically a legacy ""fire-fighting"" style game mixed with a narrative escape-room-riddle-game, that is to say, there's content, puzzles, and riddles that you can only do and enjoy once. We did all the story missions, played some extra challenge missions, solved the puzzles/riddles hidden throughout the extra material you unlock, and decided to pack it up and gift it to some friends who'd love it. They've reported back that they also love it and rated it a 9.0 on BGG! The game comes with a ""standard"" game mode that plays like a modular fire-fighting game like Pandemic or The Captain is Dead, but we felt it was under baked and not worth holding onto just for that game mode. | 
Lost Cities | 5 | 7.0 | 6.5 | The game is fine. Didn't/doesn't excite us or stimulate us much. The game shares the exact same game space as Hanamikoji which we find much more interesting and rewarding to play and look at. Also the game is very simple in presentation and the theme is basically non-existent, and yet both somehow get in the way. Ironically compared to our tastes, this game would probably be far better if it was just stripped to its bare components and made a 3rd of the size so you can play on many more surfaces and fit into a standard playing card deck box, because as it is, the cards and especially the board, are completely unnecessary in their presentation and size. You could shrink the game down and give it a similar art design to Uno and I'd wager that it would be a massive hit. | 
Magic Maze | 7 | 7.5 | 5.5 | No surprise here, real time co-op, no communication, and paper thin theme made this very unenjoyable for my wife and most people we showed it to. The gameplay excites me a lot but it was disheartening that every time we played it most people at the table left the game really disliking it. We have and love ""Escape: The Curse the Temple"" so I was hoping this would scratch a similar itch but this is much more challenging while offering much less lighthearted chaos.  | 
Modern Art  | 4 | 8.0 | 8.0 | So, we got this game because my father-in-law is an art handler and knew he'd love the game, and winner winner, he did love it! And we love the game too! Problem is, one of our favorites games ever and favorite game to play with family, is Chinatown, and Chinatown and Modern Art have very similar game feel despite having very different mechanisms/actions. We brought Modern Art to a dozen family game nights and either they'd be sad we didn't bring Chinatown or ask to play to Chinatown instead if we did bring it. Our friend group have zero interest in both games and so we decided to cut it. We think the game, theme, premise, and presentation are all great so highly recommend it to anyone who enjoy open trading/deal making. | 
Mysterium | 5 | 7.0 | 5.0 | Mysterium was another one of the first games we ever picked up and owned it from 2017 - 2022 and played it about 1 time a year in that time. During each game most players would look or outwardly express frustration with the pacing of the game and it always felt like whoever was the ghost was the only one having fun at the table. We wanted to like the game thus holding on to it so long but this is one I don't think we'll miss while having nothing really bad to say about it.. | 
One Deck Dungeon | 6 | 7.5| N/A | This game is hard and it's just a bit too shallow in mechanics for its difficulty. I was actually really enjoying it until I picked up Too Many Bones (TMB). The game feel of the two is very similar but TMB is everything I wish One Deck Dungeon was. That said, TMB is also $100 and consequently has easily 5x the content and mechanics, so I admit it's not a fair comparison. I think One Deck Dungeon does have a lot to offer for anyone looking for a challenging solo game that takes up very little table space compared to other games. | 
Resistance: Avalon | 2 | 8.0 | N/A | I'll keep this one short and sweet, I've just fallen out of love with barebones hidden traitor games like Werewolf. I've played The Thing and Nemesis and I vastly prefer the more in-depth/consequential uses of hidden traitor mechanics in those games to games completely centered on hidden traitors. My wife also gets extremely anxiety with hidden traitor games so she never played this one. Having said all that, this is by far the best of the ""Werewolf/Mafia"" style games I've played and recommend it to anyone who likes those games but are looking something for a bit more player agency without being overwhelming. | 
Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island | 4 | 6.5 | 6.0 | The games theme is survival in an unfair and unforgiving world and it delivers on it that. It just so happens that neither of us are a huge fan of how harsh the mechanics and premise is. This was our first jump into more intense co-op games after Forbidden Desert and Pandemic, and it was definitely way more than we can handle back in the day. We held onto the game for years and played it 2 times in 2021 and decided then it wasn't for us but held on to it anyway, so it was an easy one to purge this year. The games theme and mechanics are merged perfectly and there's a ton of replayability in that box so we definitely recommend it to people who like co-op and are a bit masochistic haha | 
Santorini | 6 | 7.5 | 6.0 | We like Hive better. Santorini is fine and impressive for its price point especially, but as a two player head-to-head abstract strategy game, we'd rather play Hive 9 times out of 10. We actually found that we preferred Santorini without the powers which probably helps explain why we like Hive more. There's a lot to like in Santorini so I imagine the game is beloved by many and can be a huge winner for many people as well. | 
Secret Hitler | 10 | 6.0 | 5.0 | As with our reasonings for Avalon above: I don't like games centered on hidden traitors and they give my wife extreme social anxiety. I recommend this game to people over base Werewolf but wouldn't recommend it over Avalon. | 
Sequence | 2 | 3.0 | 4.0 | We were gifted this for Christmas last year by a good friend, so even though after one look at the box and the complete lack of theme or premise, our initial reaction was to immediately toss it, we gave the game a try and found that, yup, the game is as dry and soulless as it looks. It feels like a Knizia game but with zero of the interaction and interesting tactical decisions or long term strategy of his games. Even at 4 players it felt like there was minimal interaction because the game relied so heavily on luck of the draw. I don't know, I don't want to rag too much on an old classic game but we can't recommend the game to anyone and please god don't gift to someone you like for Christmas. | 
Sheriff of Nottingham: 2nd Edition | 0 | N/A | N/A | We won this game in 2021 as part of a bundle of mystery/random games and unfortunately this one never appealed to us. We cracked open the box, read the rules, and watched the SUSD review and still felt lukewarm on it. We brought it to light-game nights with friends and family and we never voted to try it out. Traded it for some new cards for one of our MTG Commander decks and haven't regretted it. | 
Skull | 22 | 7.0 | 6.0 | Cockroach poker does the same thing but with more interaction, interesting choices, and just more laughs. Skull is a fine game, some would say great and I wouldn't argue, but for us Cockroach Poker is just vastly superior. We used to love Skull and it would be our filler game but since we picked up Cockroach Poker in 2019 we pulled out Skull less and less and so it was an easy decision to cut it. | 
Star Wars: Imperial Assault (only played co-op gamemode) | 3 | 7.5 | 8.0 | This was a hard one to part with. We just picked up the game in 2021 for my birthday and acquired every official co-op capable expansion and got a nice organizer for it. The plays for this one are bit misleading as that counts only 1 play for a scenario but each scenario took us 2 - 3 sessions to get through, and that's where our primary issue with the game comes in: Game length. While the gameplay is snappy and very fun, even going at a brisk pace each scenario was taking us 2 - 4 hours to complete. We only have 1 dining table and it's tiny and we have a 2 year old that wouldn't leave the game alone if we left it on the table. We tried taking photos of the scenario and packing up between sessions but it was way too fiddly to do that well or efficiently. We both love a lot about the game, the theme and gameplay especially, but constant rulebook checking/clarification (a problem with every FFG game honestly) and lengthy setup + gameplay meant we basically had zero time to play this game. We actually didn't intend to cut this one from our collection but were offered a sweet deal on store credit if we traded it a FLGS so we caved and took it. We've found that we don't miss it as much as we expect we would, but have fanciful dreams to pick it up again if we ever get a board gaming table with a nice ""vault"" but that's not likely to happen any time soon. | 
Sushi Roll | 7 | N/A | 6.0 | I never played this one as I never had interest but my wife showed it to lots of people and eventually it just lost its luster. It's a good game and satisfying to play once or twice but the replayability and depth is completely lacking compared to other phenomenal drafting games like Sushi Go Party and 7 Wonders. If there were expansions adding more dice and maybe a new layer or two then this could be a gem, but as is it feels very shallow and short lived. | 
That's Pretty Clever! | 14 | 7.0 | 7.5 | We only liked this game playing just the two of us and over time we just lost any interest in it and it was easily parted with. It's in this awkward space of being too long to be a filler, not interactive enough for 3+ players, and zero theme to keep you coming back. Otherwise the gameplay itself is actually quite fun and fulfilling and the game regularly goes for less than $10 so it's an easy recommend. | 
Wavelength | 13 | 8.0 | 8.5 | We love this game but the app completely replaced the physical version for us. The physical game is great and has a wonderful presentation and is such a delight to play in a living room with a good group of people, so we definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good well designed party game. The app plays a little differently, at least in feel, so if you prefer physical games I'd stick to the physical copy of Wavelength. |

"Hi, hope everyone knows Can't Stop, but if not, in short you roll 4 D6, then divide them into 2 pairs, add those up and go forward on the respective tracks. Like if you roll 1, 1, 4, 6 you can either go forward on 2&amp;10 or 5&amp;7. As the tracks have different lengths I thought about which strategy is better, going ""rare numbers"" (2-3&amp;11-12) or ""common numbers"" (6-8). BUT I can't get my head around the math. A 2 (or similar 12) is kind of easy, because out of 1296 rolls you have 1 for a quadruple 1s, 4x5=20 for a triple 1s and 6x25=150 for double 1s, making it 171/1296= 13.19_4%. But how would that math work for 7 or 8?

Also...is my calculation correct to begin with? Why isn't it just 1/36 (chance to roll snake eyes on two dice) times 6 (combinations of distributing 2 dice between 4 dice) which would be 1/6 aka 16._6%?

And how do I get the effect in that rolling a quadruple 1s would advance me twice on the the 2?

"Back in the day, I played a dungeon-based board game. One of the things that could happen when landing on a space was an attack of Snotlings - goblin-like critters. If I remember correctly you started with 3d6 of them, and had to fight them until you defeated them all; each round of combat you could kill 2d6 of them, but 1d6 new ones arrived through the hole in the wall/floor/ceiling.

"I played [Fantasy Realms](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/223040/fantasy-realms) (not a Chudyk game) for the first time this year and it straight up shook my board gaming reality. I was blown away by how much depth, variety and replay value could be packed into a small deck of cards. It made me question why I’d ever want to go back to playing 2+ hour table hogs with huge boards and a million pieces. So I set off in search of other small-box, component efficient games and I found the master, the *mad scientist*, the **Knizia-level genius** of **Carl Chudyk**. The way he turns multi-use cards into an absolute explosion of interesting gameplay is just mind boggling. In these 4 tiny boxes costing less than $100 total, I have a complete collection of deep, rewarding and replayable games for any group of of 2-6 players. 

----------

**[Glory to Rome](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/19857/glory-rome)**

I’m not going to go deep on why this game is great because it’s been said 1,000 times. What I will tell you is that it is shockingly easy to DIY. Here is your shopping list:

* 200 Magic The Gathering or similar sized cards and sleeves (you might already have these)

* 27 pages of full color prints on basic-ass paper from Kinkos (DM me for further instructions)

* Paper Cutter (or use Kinko’s for free)

* Corner Rounder (not absolutely necessary but ups the production value a lot)

So for like $20 bucks and some elbow grease you’ll be on your way to having your own copy of this legendary game that absolutely lives up to the hype. If you’re into building engines and combos that feel powerful and satisfying – this is it. 

----------

**[Mottainai](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/175199/mottainai)**


This game feels like playing Glory to Rome in a straight jacket, and I’m here to tell you that is NOT a bad thing for a two player game. I had to listen to the Analysis Paralysis Podcast deep-dive on Mottainai to really unlock it for me, but I was handsomely rewarded with a deliciously strategic game that will result in 100s of plays. It’s fast and fierce and strategic as hell. You will 100% get out what you put into this game. It’s free to play on [Yucata.de](https://www.yucata.de/en) and you’ll always be able to find a game with the very active and friendly community. That said, I would recommend learning how to play on a physical copy (less than $15 on Amazon) because the online interface is very minimal and you have to know what you’re looking at to understand what some of the numbers mean. The learning curve is a little steep for a small card game, but the ride down the other side is wonderful.

----------

**[Innovation](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/63888/innovation)**

If you don’t want to cut yourself on the sharp edges of Mottainai, or if you just want to take a break from the claustrophobia of it, then Innovation is the ticket. The arc of this game will keep you coming back again and again. You start out with small engines and combos that get bigger and crazier as the game goes on. It’s a race to 6 achievements but you’re never out of the game even at 5 to 0 because the late game cards are so insane and offer all sorts of come back potential. It’s dead simple to learn as well. All the complexity is emergent in the cards but I promise you will figure it out. I haven’t tried 2v2 yet but I hear it’s a great option for when you have four players. Also free to play on both [Yucata.de](https://www.yucata.de/en) and [BGA](https://boardgamearena.com/)

----------

**[Impulse](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/144239/impulse)**

Don’t fall into the trap of thinking this is a 4X mashed up with Glory to Rome. This is a hair-on-fire engine builder. It’s like being in a Mad Max style car chase where you are slapping together an improvised weapon from random shit in the glove box. Most of the time you’ll be trading pot shots with pop guns for a few points here and there, but every so often you stumble into the right pieces and get to fire a boosted rocket for an explosion of points. If you are prone to analysis paralysis, this game is your worst nightmare. But if you get off on McGuyvering your way out of a bad situation with duct tape and paper clips, you will see the beauty of this game. It will never play the same way twice and every board state will be a glorious snowflake. Of the four games listed here, this one is the least accessible and the most bat-shit crazy, but it also might be the most genius. There’s a dirt cheap copy of the hideously ugly 1st edition on BGG market right now for anyone brave enough to take a chance on this madman’s masterpiece.

"Hi all!  I recently stumbled upon Horrified, and absolutely LOVE it.  My girlfriend and I have been playing it pretty much nightly.  We're pretty much obsessed.  We absolutely love how no two games are ever the same.  So when we learned that there was another version, Horrified: American Monsters, we were beyond excited and immediately purchased it.  Unfortunately, it missed the mark for us.

It almost seemed like American Monsters was rushed.  The board and items are beuatiful, but the gameplay just isn't there.  There are so many typos in the rulebook, and so much is just confusing.  Many of the monsters rules aren't explained very well, so it's kind of unclear exactly how you defeat some of them.  Some of the monsters just seem far too easy to defeat (we literally defeated the Banshee within just a few moves). The game was definitely better on second play, and after we did some research for clarification on the rules (it seems the confusion for some of the monsters is pretty widespread).  While we definitely plan to continue playing it, we certainly prefer the original over American Monsters.

"Hi r/boardgames!

After \~5 years of development and a successful Kickstarter a year ago, I finally managed to make my game, Not Enough Mana, available to the public (with some priceless aid from SUPERHOT Presents.)

To celebrate, **I’m giving away 5 physical copies** (30$ MSRP value each) + shipping!

[Not Enough Mana - a potion drinking card game of wizardly struggles, educated choices and regret when choices backfyre](https://preview.redd.it/g822i2h6t30a1.jpg?width=2240&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0589a168d22c0812e6025b3fa3bae10d55b4e683)

**WHAT SORCERY IS THIS?**

*Not Enough Mana* is a ‘potion’ drinking card game for 3-6 fearless wizards (legal potion drinking age may vary depending on your kingdom’s laws.) You’ll be destroying each other using epic spells, curses and artifacts while replenishing your mana by drinking magical potions\*. Your goal is to eliminate all other wizards from the game, either through depleting all their health points or by K.O. (also known as *Too Much Mana*.)

\*Potions not included. The Institute suggests potions of 40% mana essence potency.

"I went to my FLGS to pick up an order and have recently found myself in the market for some small box games ideal for 2 players -- work has been crazy lately and I often remain working until midnight, and these smaller easier games are all I can manage to fit in or have energy for. While looking through the small box shelf, my gf came across **botanik** amd said she liked the art style and that it seemed interesting. The art style reminded me remarkably of one of the first games I owned on steam called Machinarium, for which I maintain a certain fondness and whose soundtrack I was literally listening to that same day, so I looked on BGG to see what the general verdict was. The consensus seemed positive and it was like 20CAD so a pretty easy game to take a chance on, so I picked it up.

We played it tonight (at midnight after I finished work) and it was just lovely. The tiles have a hard durable feel with really nice art, the closed game board looks like a diary and the (totally unnecessary) first player token is this little resin pawn that just made me happy every time I picked it up. That pawn alone felt like it came from a lacerda or wehrle game.

The gameplay is fairly short, about 30 mins, and there are some decently crunchy decisions in there. It's still quiere a light game, don't get me wrong, but on the more medium side of light. But the decisions aren't trivially ""this is most optimal, do this"", instead making you think ""do I want this tile for myself later, would I prefer to release a tile I need now before my opponent forces me to use one i don't want to, or should I force them to use one they don't want to?"", and this decision is one you make almost every turn. Nothing ever felt decided for me and it was surprisingly strategic for such a small, light game.

From its quick but satisfying gameplay to its great art and quality pieces, I'm astounded I have never seen this game brought up in this sub and I thought it deserved some attention.

"Original link to the first post here:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/rzv8r5/im\_a\_sore\_loser\_and\_i\_hate\_it/](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/rzv8r5/im_a_sore_loser_and_i_hate_it/)

It's been nearly a year now, and I'm hoping that reporting back here gives other people useful tips and tricks. To begin with, no, I am not totally cured of my sore loser tendencies. That said, I am **much** better. What helped me was:

&amp;#x200B;

\- Finding a group that I fit into well. This happened almost entirely by chance, but I love my weekly Magic group, and I'm working on finding a board game group as well. I didn't love the group I had before. This one is small, casual enough that I can ask questions, and typically respectful. I know that some of these guys could grind me into a paste, some of them regularly join and win tournaments, but these are friendly matches where everything is more or less even.  The less-competitive nature of the games makes me much more laid back and able to say, ""eh, maybe next time"" when I lose... although I'm happy to say, I put up much more of a fight these days :)

&amp;#x200B;

\-  I focus on either co-op games or games that aren't terribly competitive when playing with players who can be intense when it comes to winning. My boyfriend tends to edge on the competitive side, so unless we are playing low stakes games like Wingspan or Azul, we mostly play co-op. We save the more serious stuff for game night where other people can get in on the dynamic and even out the odds (I am better, but not as good of a strategist as he is! I likely never will be, and that's ok, so long as we have fun)!

\-This might get me some hate, but I personally avoid games that I know will send me into the Salt mines of the Lost. I know myself well enough in this regard, and Scythe is definitely on that list. I've played it multiple times to see, tried various tactics and factions, but I seem as of yet unable to stop focusing on the L instead of what I could do differently next time. There are enough cool, fun games to enjoy that I've decided not to worry about this for now.

&amp;#x200B;

\- A no brainer, but I always try to remember that it's just a game. With enough time, I likely will not remember the particular match, or it will be a funny memory if I do. There are certain Magic cards that I remember from the early days of getting my butt handed to me that make me chuckle now that I know how the dynamic works, and it's definitely a friendly grudge when they are played, but nothing more.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Be upfront with whoever you're playing with about your abilities after you know them well enough, or if it's a new group, just intro yourself at the level you're at. I don't think anyone hates a beginner who shows up with the right attitude. Please don't be the person that concedes every time things don't go your way, put in an honest effort. Some things that I told my friends included that I'm trying to learn, not happy with my current playing ability (but really want to get there), and I get frustrated sometimes with my seeming lack of great strategy skills. I'm happy to report that they've all been supportive af, and knowing that they know about these things makes it a lot easier to focus on my own strategy instead of the potential loss speeding my way (lol).

&amp;#x200B;

I'll stop there with the tips. If you find yourself magically transforming into a massive toddler when you lose board games, it is your job to find out ways to manage it. It's not your fault you are as you are, but if you're unhappy with it, it's your way to fix it if you can. Keep an open mind, as well! Is your group a bad fit? Some people don't want to babysit a new player, and that's their right. Find a group that you can have fun with! I doubt my prior game group was *trying* to get my goat, but because of my own status with myself, I took some of their comments personally and felt unwelcome as a noob. Still, if you just don't get along with a group, try another! Now, if you don't get along with *any* group, maybe it's time to ask yourself some tough questions, lol.

&amp;#x200B;

I doubt very many people slid out of the womb being salty sore losers. I'm no psychologist, but typically something happens along the way that molds you into being a certain way. If you suffer from these issues, it may be worth it to check things out with a therapist. Don't ever think that skrimping on your own health, mental or otherwise, is dumb or a waste of time.

"For me it was this afternoon playing my first ever match of Pampero.

2p game. Absolutely hated it. I think this might be a good game, I just got demolished to the point I was misserable for the better part of an hour. There are no catchup mechanisms, so an experienced player will destroy a new player every single time. The game ended like 250 points to like.. 60. To top that off the guy I was playing with was really thinking through all of his turns, trying to maximize his score as much as possible.

[Rant] If you don't know the game, basically his first couple of actions he grabbed a couple of one time bonuses that allowed him to grab a bonus tile that gave him an extra action every round. In this game you each play 3 actions per round and then move to the next round. Basically, imagine if in Lost Ruins of Arnak you had another adventurer that you (and only you) could unlock at the start of the game. It not only broke the game in his favor but also made me feel miserable. He was taking all the better spots and bonuses and managed to play by the end around 6 actions more than me with nothing I could do. Now knowing the rules I know that would've been a risky move because I could've bought the tile instead of him (giving him a bunch of money to compensate for the point) and then balance the game out. 

I wonder how the 2 actions per round tile is balanced. It really made the game a misserable experience to play. I don't see the comparison to Concordia at all. I might give this another chance, but really soured me on this game. Hadn't had such a bad time playing a boardgame in.. I don't remember how long. [/rant]

I after learned how to play Exceed though, and after 4-6 matches my mood was good again. That was a fun little fighter game!

"Hi all, 

I played a Board Game in german not that long ago and I wanted to know if I could buy a copy of this game. I apologize if this is not the correct subreddit to ask this question. I took a photo of the cardbox which says ""Für einen besonders lieben menschen"" (see the photo), which doesn't seem enough for me to find it in the internet. 

I was wondering if you knew this game (either in German or English) and could help me find its real name or where to buy it. 

Game info:

The game contains plenty of square tiles with numbers from 1-20 and one with an image of a donkey. 

All tiles start faced down and randomly placed around the table. Each player has to take one tile and place it either:

1. On the center pile (starting from 1 up to 20)
2. On other player's pile (if the number is the next/previous to the top's pile tile number). You can give the donkey if a player has a 20.
3. On your own pile face up.

The objective is to finish all the randomly placed tiles on the table without any tile on your own pile. The game continues even if there are no more tiles on the table, trying to give other players the tiles from your pile. The loser is the last one with tiles on his pile.",Board Game name?,1,self.boardgames,yvbxty,yohavyr,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/yvbxty/board_game_name/,1668458386

"I’ve come to realize I enjoy games when there is an element of “excitement”. And the more often it happens, then the more fun we have. I do like some strategy involved, but games tend to lean to the lighter side. 

I am trying to pin point what elements lead to excitement and if some mechanics can’t be that exciting. 

To me, it comes from the anticipation of the unknown result. It also helps if the result has a big effect on the game. 

Card  reveals and dice rolls are obvious examples. Pushing your luck is also exciting. I also find it it way more interesting if that element is engaging the other players and it will effect them in some way. 

Combos and chain effects can be exciting but usually only for the one player doing them.

"Hey gang, I have been collecting board games and have far too many at this point, but unfortunately I was forced into culling a lot of titles after a house fire and the ensuing firefighting methods involving water.   
Thankfully no one was hurt, and a few months later we have a new place (we were staying with friends at the time of the fire, due to economy + rent being insane) and I am working on replacing a few favorite games. 

A bunch of my games were stored in the main area where the fire broke out in plastic totes. A number of games were lost and while I was able to save a few gems (Discworld, most components of Wonderland War,  ) I lost My Star Realms Universal Storage box containing near-complete sleeved Star Realms (all early promos as well) and all my Hero Realms stuff. First year or so of that so HR should be easily replaced.

Now my question is what is the best way to go about getting the other missing content, and what exactly AM I missing that isn't impossibly expensive? We have a few of the packs at work but I'd rather buy a bundle or used if I can find them.   


Star Realms was one of my most-played deckbuilders so I am thrilled to have a good portion back, just gotta know where to go from here. Is there a good list out there of what specifically does not come in the nova box? This way I can prowl the web, BGG and similar to get back on track.

"This is maybe my fourth BGGCON. I have also been to BGGSPRING once (this year). However, this year's BGGCON has been my favorite so far! I got a chance to play many new games, so I figured I would give my first impression of them. So here we go!

**Starship Captains:** \- (w/4 players) - This was better than I expected! I liked the technology cards that you can slot into your ship to make you more effective or to score you points at the end of the game. There was some nice strategic decisions to make throughout the game as well. I also liked the worker placement mechanic and thematic ties of ""beaming"" your away team to the mission card that you place beside your board. **7/10**

**Atiwa:** (w/4 players) - Uwe Rosenberg game that was very smooth to play. Lighter than his Agricola but heavier than his New York Zoo. My first play of this game, I felt it would become too samey after repeated plays and didn't have an urge to revisit. HOWEVER. I slept on it and played it a second time the next day and continued to enjoy it and see new strategies. Now I am really liking this game and it may be my favorite of the convention (or close second). **9/10**

**Tiletum:** (w/4 Players) - Not a good first impression on this one for me. Probably the player count as turns could get long and tedious. I did like the dice mechanic. I probably need to revisit this with just 2 or 3 players. **6/10**

**Cat in the Box:** (w/3 players) - This game is a fantastic and unique game that I could see be a great night cap filler on a game night. I really liked this one. It's trick taking with a little area control on the scoreboard, something I have never seen been done before! **9/10**

**Terracotta Army:** (w/4 players) - Again, probably not the ideal game to play at 4 players...turns took a long time. Also the scoring of the statues that happens at the end of every round is killer. It becomes so convoluted and time consuming to score. I wish it was simpler because the rest of the game is really good. **6/10**

**Marrakesh:** (w/ 3 players) - Ah, a Feld game that is actually fun! I loved trying to figure out where to slot pegs in on the fantastic dual layer player boards everyone gets. Probably one of my favorite player boards in gaming that I have seen! Colors are vibrant and easy to distinguish as well. Just a fun game that I would love to revisit. My only ding is the tech tiles are very situational and not very game changing (at least at first blush). **9/10**

**Revive:** (w/3 player) - Thank GOODNESS we did not play this at 4 players because I can't imagine how long this game would take. Again, turns take a very long time, and it was borderline annoying at 3 players but i really liked the card play and tech upgrades on your player board. This player board is a close second to Marrakesh's player board for coolness factor too. I expected this game to be like a heavier euro in the same vain as Gaia Project or Terra Mystica but was slightly disappointed it felt a little lighter than those. Not much player interaction or fighting (well there is no battle mechanic in this game lol) so don't expect too much of that. Needless to say I went ahead and preordered this game anyways. **7/10**

**Amsterdam:** (w/2 players) - I'm glad we played the ""short"" variant.. This game still took a long time, even at two players. The set up was a BEAR. So many pieces. And the first half of the game seemed so inconsequential and boring. However, I did like the card play and resource management wheel. And the game ramps up pretty dramatically towards the end. But it wasn't enough to save the set up time and first half of the game. **6/10**

**Endless Winter:** (w/2 players) - More like Endless Game, am I right? But seriously, this game took a while even at two players for what is essentially a deck building/area control game. However, I loved the components and slowly got used to the funky turn structure. I would play again, but wasn't blown away by this one. **6/10**

**Autobahn:** (w/4 player) - This game was too long at 4 players, but I liked it so much I played again at 3 players and the game played much smoother! The rulebook is atrocious. You will need to go to bgg forums for clarifications. Its a must because one misstep in the rules will ruin this game. For someone that doesn't like ""economic"" games, this one spoke to me. I also love the fact that the only points that are scored at the end of the game is the amount of people you have in that scoring office. Very simple.  This game desparetely already needs a second edition with some Ian O'Toole artwork. **9/10**

**Lacrimosa:** (w/3 player) - This game reminded me of a slightly heavier Gutenberg. Unfortunately, I think I prefer Gutenberg more. It was very smooth playing as well so I will give it that. The theme didn't really come through for me either. **6/10**

**Flamecraft:** (w/3 players) - Probably the sweet spot for player count for this game as well! Sure this game has cute dragon art and simple rules, but gosh darnit, I did not expect some strategic decisions to make in this game! I love how you balance getting scoring cards or more dragons to play into your hands. I like the variability of the different shops that come out. This was very unexpectantly fun! **9/10**

**Galenus:** (w/2 players) - Completely uninteresting game play. Extremely boring location actions. We didn't see the appeal of this game and actually quit halfway through and didn't finish. **2/10**

**Woodcraft:** (w/4 players) - Turns were pretty quick in this one. Unfortunately I didn't realize that the bonuses you get from the wheel aren't all that great most of the time and you should really be going for actions that get you tons of blueberries or more characters or upgrades (just forget about bonuses on the wheel for the most part!). But I love the tools at your disposal to plant trees, cut lumber, glue lumber, add to lumber, etc. and the ability to get more contracts to fulfill throughout the game. The characters that you can hire to help you are cool too! The most thematic game that marries seamlessly with the mechanics, which is not typical of this designers games. One of my favorite games of the con (it probably edges out Atiwa)! **9/10**

**Hamlet: (w/2 players)** \- I like the open world nature of this euro game. I like the fact that you can expand the world in any direction you want.. I like the shared nature of resources on the board. I like the laser focused objective of completing the church to end the game. Unfortunately we ran out of time and didn't get to finish (the hot games library closes at 1 am!). But I would love to revisit this one. I would probably keep it at a 3 player game at most as well. Those hexes started to get filled up quite busily towards the end there to where it was almost unmanageable. Maybe they should have made the hexes and pieces about 25% bigger.

I really enjoyed it **except** the issues with balancing as the game relies heavily on dice rolls.   
The concept of the game is brilliant but it just seems to run on for so long when you get to the inner most ring because you can end up having to get back to the start etc.

Do any of the editions like Harry Potter/Kingdom Hearts address this?

I like the IP of Harry Potter a lot as a few of my group will be into this. Has anyone played this or the KH version? 

I'm not asking for the dice rolls to be addressed because that's a core mechanic of the game, just to see if the win conditions have been made easier.

"So yesterday I was the storyteller for my friend, who wanted to celebrate his birthday by playing Blood on the Clocktower with a large group of friends. He and I are both fans of No Rolls Barred’s series on BotC, and after having spent an inordinate amount of time watching videos about it and talking about it together, he felt he had an excuse and seized it with both hands. 

And let me tell you, if you’re into social deduction then this game is a BLAST. The evil team won, and our roles were divided as follows: 

GOOD:  
– Fortune teller  
– Investigator  
– Chef  
– Soldier  
– Slayer  
– Empath  
– Gravedigger

OUTSIDER:   
– Drunk (presenting as Monk)  
– Saint  

Evil:   
– Poisoner  
– Scarlet Woman  
– Imp  

Advice online said that you could choose roles randomly in this script (Trouble Brewing) and have a good time, but I decided that I would choose the roles myself. I went with these roles in order to have a balance of roles that would get repeated info, info beforehand and just do cool things. I added the Drunk because I think it’s hilarious, but made sure that they both had a role that would allow them to figure out they were drunk and not be fed misleading information the whole game as I thought that would be a bit too rough during a first game. I had initially put in the Spy as a minion, but got cold feet and put in the Scarlet Woman because having to potentially repeatedly and quickly make decisions on false info to give to players felt like a bit too much for my first romp as a storyteller. 

All in all the game ended up taking about three hours (including setup and teach), but luckily everyone had a great time. There was one person at the end of it who was ambivalent about playing again, and everyone else was enthusiastically looking forward to another game. I would personally call that a success. My favourite moment was during round three, when a group of five players (who had started calling themselves The Circle of Trust) had made a plan where they would correctly use the Slayer’s power to try and eliminate the Demon during the day, only for that plan to fall apart because the Poisoner had poisoned the Slayer after they had implied that they might do something powerful in the future. During the post mortem afterwards, we all agreed that the moment where their slayer attempt did not work was the moment that the game fell apart for the good team. Some clever psyops plays by the Scarlet Woman during the next day phase cemented the win for the evil team, even after the good team had theoretically put the game on lock during the day phase. Absolutely fantastic game, there really are moments in this that you just can’t get from anything else. 

Finally, here are some of my own take-aways after my first time running this game. 

**Running this game is daunting**. The storyteller really has to have the rules to this game ON LOCK. There are a large number of weird interactions and timing things that can fully mess up your game if you don’t get them right, and players will ask you difficult rules questions about very niche and specific interactions right in the heat of the moment. You really have to be on top of things as a storyteller. It probably didn’t help that we played a twelve person game for our first game, even though they don’t recommend going above, like, eight for your first time. Oh well. 

**Preparation is key**. This goes beyond simply knowing the rules. Having your physical materials ready (such as a place to put your grimoire), having a good idea of what your roles are going to be, and having your teach ready to fire are very important. I had been practicing my teach for two days before we got into it, just because I wanted to make sure that I only had to do it once, that it would be brief and that it would be crystal clear when we were actually going to start playing.  Not saying that that’s mandatory (I tend to be over-prepared for things like this, mostly because I’m a teacher and I don’t know when enough is enough), but having an understanding deep enough for you to do things without having to think much about it is key. This is absolutely not a game that you can just run by reading the rulebook out loud for the first time. 

**Make sure your group is into it**. We were blessed with a group where everyone was into playing, but if you are uncomfortable with lying or you take it personally when someone lies to you, this is not your game. That’s not entirely true of course; you can actually get quite far in this game by never lying if you’re a Townsfolk, but lying, deception and gaps of information are this game’s bread and butter. I had prepared a social safety talk about how you’re inhabiting a role in this game (“because let’s be honest, none of us are a bishop, a drunk, a poisoner or a demon in our life outside of this game”), but I didn’t end up needing it. Also, this game is a blast and a half to watch. We had one person who did not feel up to playing, and I shared my grimoire with them and got to commiserate about the delightful chaos I had wrought. But that chaos was only ever that delightful because everyone was continually excited about the game we were playing and the things we were doing. 

**Making mistakes is okay**. I made so many mistakes. During the first night phase (night zero if you will), I had forgotten to wake up the demon and their minions, and I had not shown them their demon bluffs. If I hadn’t put everyone back to sleep then, the game would have been absolutely boned. Similarly, I had accidentally walked up to the Slayer to make sure that they understand how their role worked (because we were halfway through day 3 and I hadn’t heard them discuss any of it with anyone) only to find out that I had accidentally asked the Saint if they understood their Slayer role. And you know what, none of it ended up mattering at the end of the day. All mistakes were fixed and the game was a blast! So perfection is unnecessary, so long as you can fix it. 

**This really isn’t “just Werewolves” with extra steps.** I sometimes read comments online where people say that this game is just Werewolves with extra roles and rules thrown in, but that really isn’t true if you look at the depth and the level of agency that players have in the actual game. It would be like saying that, for example, A Feast for Odin is just Mint Works with extra steps because they’re both worker placement games – it really isn’t true if you look at it beyond the absolute furthest abstract. I had a talk about this with the players afterwards where we agreed that the dead players, in some sense, had a lot MORE power than alive players by virtue of the fact that their involvement actually costs something; a dead player’s single vote is incredibly costly. Secondly, there’s some actual info that you can use to actually untangle the game, rather than having to rely solely on random shuffling sounds you hear in the night and the tone of voice you normally hear someone use. And the actual 7D chess moves you can do in this game are astonishing, you can just look at some of the nonsense that is happening at the end of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSNpjey772Y), there’s nothing else like that. You just abjectly can’t get that from Werewolves.

**I still wish the dead players had more to do.** My main gripe is that, even after all that, I just wished there was more for dead players to do. There was one player who unfortunately died early and had used his ghost vote early as well, meaning that he had no meaningful decisions to make for about half the time that the game was running. He was still actively involved, still plotting and untangling and planning, but every time I passed by him when it was time to vote you saw that he wanted to be able to raise his hand. I understand why the game works like this; staying alive is a premium and voting while dead is costly. It conveys that well, and I made sure that players understood before we started playing. But even so, I just wished that he (and players like him) would have had something more to do, some other decision to make during the night phase other than electioneering. 

Anyway, that’s my thoughts. Can’t wait to go again, and I can’t wait to be absolutely gaslit as a player.","Yesterday I ran my first game of Blood on the Clocktower as the storyteller, here's my take-aways.",1,self.boardgames,yuyjlz,DarkJjay,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/yuyjlz/yesterday_i_ran_my_first_game_of_blood_on_the/,1668430539

The board was mostly ocean dotted with islands, and built out throughout the game, so you would add tiles as you went, and the corners of the tiles would be the center of the islands. As new islands were build each port would get packages at it that can be delivered back to the main island. The goal was to build shipping lanes from the center island to the new islands, dock your ship at the ports to load up the packages and bring them back. I also think each player had a bigger card that you placed the packages on to keep track of numbers somehow?? but not sure.

We remember it having a greek island sounding name, and both of us think it started with A, but clearly we could be wrong.

If they are losing they get progressively more and more tense. They get visibly mad if you undercut their winning strategy. For me it takes all the fun out of the game. I have a friend like this and don't want to play with him but I don't know how to tell him.","How do you deal with the ""must win"" person at the table?",1,self.boardgames,yub6mz,Iknowmorethanyou35,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/yub6mz/how_do_you_deal_with_the_must_win_person_at_the/,1668367401

"Has anyone else wanted a Season Counter feature for PARKS? As in, some way to keep track of the season you are on (1-4)? 

I’m aware that this isn’t needed (bc you can just count the number of Advanced Sites on the trail). However, I feel like it would be *nice to have since the game has so many other beautiful features and components. 

This may sound silly, but especially Solo, I feel like you can so in your head during games you can easily forget what stage/season you’re on. This “getting lost” is true for other games, not just PARKS for me and I cannot be the only one!

"We are going to hang out at a local board game tavern in our area and my partner invited their friends that have interest in, but are ultimately new to board games. I have introduced my partner to a myriad of games that I like; rising sun, ankh, nemesis, brass birmingham, deck building games, etc. that they also enjoyed. Last night we tried Quacks, which is fun with new or 3+ players but ultimately the game seemed too easy for them. I made the mistake of introducing my playgroup initially to rising sun, and while it took like 3 attempts before we finally played it correctly, and everyone still really enjoyed it, it was a lot to ask, and I don't want to scare these new people off.  

What is a good 5 person game that we can introduce these newer players to, where we could also enjoy it? 

note: my partner does not like boring looking euro games (brown or muted pastel themes), they need to have some life in the artwork if that helps its silly, but this is an important factor.

tl;dr: OP and partner are introducing 3 newish to board games people to game, op and partner don't want to be bored with a super simple game, please help.","Good intro game with 5 player count, where 2 are very experienced players?",1,self.boardgames,yu47av,lordzeon123,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/yu47av/good_intro_game_with_5_player_count_where_2_are/,1668351953

"Ok. So, storytime: my group loves Mysterium. But the set up is tedious.

I realised the set up is basically a randomised number picker with extra steps. So I set out to code my own random number picker. I'm a noob coder who only know the basics (it's a non-optimal code, but it works). I decided to use ""Codea"", an iPad app, so I could bring it to my table with ease. Pictures of it in action are below. Features in annex

https://imgur.com/gallery/xQFYnVU

I had no intention of sharing this publicly or charging for it. Mainly because I thought the community would have came up with something more advanced (idk like a github or something lol). But when I searched online, I only found the Mysterium paid app and some VPN service (Btw, if anyone has better Google skills than me and found a free resource that does this, pls comment below and I'll edit this post to close it, because it would be a non-issue then!)

So I want to help other people enjoy more ghostly gametime and less shuffling time, for free. But I don't know how to bring my Codea app to Apple store. I do not wish to pay for it, nor do I wish to charge for it. Leading to my tl;dr...

tl;dr anyone interested in helping me bring forward my personal program, currently in ""Codea"" app (Apple only I believe), into something that more people could access and use for free? DM me if you are up for it!

If there are no takers, at least I hope this post can spark some other coding genius' inspiration to make a proper version and make it available online for all. Cheers!

-------------

1) Put the ghost screen on the ipad

2) Ghost selects players and difficulty

3) Players pick out the randomly chosen cards (which, if you did teardown right, should already be in order, hehe)

4) Play!

Annex: features which I added over the years:
- supports expansions (Hidden Signs or Secrets and Lies)
- supports all listed player counts and difficulties (including the 2/3-player variants)
- supports toggling between weapons or scenes
- replaces the clairevoyance track for easier scoring (no need to fiddle with the small pointers and saves table real estate)
- (for the lol) comes with additional buttons for the ghost to make optional sounds (e.g. crow caws, knocks, thunders...). Wav files were from free open sources.

5) (optional) track clairevoyance

6) (optional) make ghost sounds


Flaws:
- supports only one promo card, P5, which i happen to have
- does not allow selection of player's colours (Actually, not exactly a flaw? I intentionally fixed the player colours so they sit in the printed order on the ghost's screen. This makes the ghost's gameplay much easier)",mysterium : help requested,1,self.boardgames,yu3lqr,zzzzzuu,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/yu3lqr/mysterium_help_requested/,1668350618

##FAQ

**I live in Peru/Canada/Belize/USA, why are you posting on a Saturday?!**

Because I'm writing this from Europe in the future where it's already Sunday. Timezones be crazy.

**Why are there a bunch of non-board games in the board game list?**

Because the Tabletop games category on Kickstarter includes anything remotely related to board games and sometimes things slip through my filters.

**Why is this future award winning board game and literal saviour of humanity missing from your list?**

Sometimes my filters get a bit overzealous and discard actually valid projects. If you feel something is missing for this reason, leave a comment and I'll add it (maybe).

**Can I donate all my money to you?**

No

**Can you help me promote my game?**

Please no. I make lists. Nothing more.

**Your list is full of errors and now I keep rolling natural 1s!**

Indeed, this fine piece of code runs purely on red, orange and brown M&amp;M's, so anything can happen. Leave a comment and I'll see what I can do.

"Hi!  
I would like to get some recommendations for a potential game to get my parents for christmas.   
For a couple of years I have bought a boardgame to my parents as a christmas gift. Now i would like some tips to keep the tradition going.    


What I'm looking for is a game that would fill the atleast most of the following criteria: 

* relatively light game and easy to learn 
* high replayability 
* works well for two players, but doesn't need to be strictly two player games, even preferably playable with atleast four players. 
* Doesn't require reading to be able to play the game (if rules are english that is ok) (my dad dont't speak english and it's pretty hard to find games in his native language) 
* relatively short playing time (preferably around 30-60 min/game) and pretty easy and fast setup.

To give a bit of reference for games that have been appreciated and popular the last years, with 100s on games played on each are:

* Splendor
* Splendor: cities of splendor expansion

"I just started playing Tainted Grail, the uber-long, cooperative card game that was a Kick Starter.  We finished the first chapter, but only because my character saved some experience points (randomly) to get the attribute we needed to finish the chapter. The rules seemed clunky, and the puzzles seemed random, and you never really knew if you were on the right path or not. I was ready to put a fork in it. Everyone in our four person gaming group agreed that the evening sucked, but now they want to re-play chapter one because now ""they understand what needs to happen.""  It feels like a sunk-cost decision because they spent a lot of money on the game they ""need"" to ""have fun"" playing it. Is this game worth playing? Is every chapter like this?

"Hey! Question regarding the game

1. If you manage to eradicate all the cubes of one virus off the board (lets say blue for now) - That means its eradicated. Does that mean when you pull a blue infection card that it has no effect. Is it the same as being cured. Can full eradication = full cure?  

2. Epidemic procedure: Draw bottom infection card, add 3 cubes to that city (handling any outbreaks), discard that card, shuffle only the infection discard pile, put it on top of the infection draw pile, and increase the infection rate.   
\^ does this mean the bottom card gets shuffled in with the rest of the cards in the discard pile?

"  

Board games themselves are one of my biggest passions in life! I just can't help but feel cursed that I must depend on board game enthusiasts to play them and no, I'm not into solo games and video games have become a money-making industry. To me, it's human interaction that makes it such a special experience. I always tell non tabletop gamers to imagine the ""lucid teleporting to another dimension"" feeling they get from reading but having 3-5 other people there with you. Human beings are social creatures so it's really just the ultimate experience!

The problem however, is that most people who are tabletop game enthusiasts usually only have about 2 of the following traits:

1. Just the right mix of competitive yet easy going

2. Social skills required to compete with other people face-to-face for hours at a time

3. Cleanliness

4. Communication and other social skills required to plan and follow through a session

5. Enough free time to play more than once a year

6. Free independent thinkers

7. Etc.

Here’s why I’m personally so frustrated. I play about once every 2-3 weeks at my awesome FLGS. There’s a couple people I love playing with but then there’s “Jenny”. Jenny practically lives at the FLGS and spends TONS of money there. I’m pretty sure her dog is dying partially because of neglect on her part. Everyone loves her and she’s definitely the matriarch of the whole place. What kills me is that when I play with Jenny is that she:

1. Laughs very loudly at every little mistake I make

2. Is a hypocrite

3. Usually picks the game and always vetoes my choice when I try to choose. I haven’t gotten to play anything I want to in more than year now even though I try every time.

4. Is highly confrontational towards me in game sometimes even breaking the cardinal rule that you have to try to win, in order to make sure someone else wins so that I don’t

5. Is biased against me no matter what

I have spent years now ignoring it, but I feel like I just can’t take it anymore. I wish I could play with other people, but the only other group I can ever join plays literally the most boring looking 30 year old euro games. There’s been several times where I calmly and professional explained to her that it’s rude to laugh at people and I’ve asked her why she’s always biased toward me, but it always causes a bit of a huffing meltdown on her part, which makes all the other gamers shy away from me as if I was the instigator. This is why she hates me btw, I’m the only one who pushes back on her poor behavior. 

I am 100% confident that talking to her on the side would do nothing productive and would only increase her efforts to alienate me from the store. I’m going to try to start organize games without her, but I’m fairly certain that when the other people she that’s she’s not playing, she’ll give them “the look” and they will probably either quickly hurry the game and not play with me again, or just straight up quit the game when they realize she’s not a part of it. I myself don’t have quite enough time to commit all of the effort to organize a group using the internet, possibly not even at the FLGS, though I hope to be able to one day.

I just wish there were more people who have their lives in order, but still enjoy gaming regularly. Imagine being spiritually addicted to an activity but relying on unreliable people to get your fix.

"You know the feeling. When you're playing the game and feel that warmth in your chest and a smile growing on your face, and you know you're experiencing something special. These games often have glaring flaws. They may not be the prettiest games, or feature the most well-designed mechanics...

But by golly, they just DON'T MISS when you have them on the table and buy into the world they creates.

A few of my selections:

* **Eldritch Horror**: Sure the game is hard as all get out, and my brother and I lose most of the time. But I love the emergent story it creates and the high stakes of the narrative. Every dice roll feels urgent and essential, and the changing asset market makes every game unique.

* **Wavelength**: Works well coop or competitively. Even when I'm out of sync with my partner and we just can't get the needle in the scoring zone, it's always enthralling to hear *why* they provided the clue that they did. No other game has prompted more personal anecdotes or perspectives, and taught me more about my loved ones. 

* **Lord of the Rings: LCG**: This game usually kicks my butt, and I'm honestly not a huge fan of deck building. But when I finally have it all set up and start flipping that encounter deck, it's the closest thing I've found to feeling like I'm in a Tolkien novel. The flavor text, the artwork, and the underlying threat of defeat take me to Middle Earth, and I feel like a small adventurer facing insurmountable odds. I'm likely getting **War of the Ring** for Christmas, and I'm hoping it provides that same exquisite vibe.",Games that provide the most moment-to-moment FUN for the players?,1,self.boardgames,ytjimh,Truebacca,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/ytjimh/games_that_provide_the_most_momenttomoment_fun/,1668290117

Advanced Cthulhu Dice:

Components: 

Two copies of Cthulhu dice (for the extra sanity tokens if desired) &amp; six D6 dice.

2-5 players, 2 players only with one copy.

Rules:

1. Give all players (and Cthulhu, who is placed centrally) six sanity tokens.
2. Choose the first player by rolling a D6 each. Highest roll starts, with players taking turns clockwise. Reroll if draw.
3. Roll the Cthulhu dice and follow the result. Die result sides are as follows:

Yellow sign: Bet against another player.

Tentacle: Bet against Cthulhu.

Cthulhu: All players lose one sanity token to Cthulhu.

Eye: Choose any player to lose two sanity tokens to Cthulhu.

Elder Sign: Recieve two sanity tokens from Cthulhu.

5. The game ends when only one player has any sanity tokens remaining (the winner) or Cthulhu has all the sanity tokens (everybody loses, less likely).

Sanity:

If it’s your turn and you no longer have any sanity tokens left, you are now insane. Roll the Cthulhu dice but only the Cthulhu, Eye and Elder Sign die side results are followed as usual. The tentacle side offers a small chance of hope, with Cthulhu offering you a single sanity token if you can roll exactly a 6 with a D6. The yellow sign is ignored.

Betting:

Choose how many sanity tokens you want to wager. One sanity token = one D6, up to a maximum of six. If you’re betting against another player, they will also do the same. The wagers must remain hidden until both players have come to a decision, at which point wagers become public to everybody.

The player who rolled the Cthulhu die that turn rolls first, adding up all their die(dice) results. The other player does the same. Whoever has the highest total roll wins all wagered sanity tokens. In case of a draw, the player who wagered the lower number of sanity tokens wins the bet. If the same number of sanity tokens were wagered by both players as well as there being a draw, then each player’s wagered sanity tokens are returned. Turn goes to the next player.

If you’re betting against Cthulhu, you must wager one sanity token plus (if applicable) how many insane players are in the game with a possible maximum of four in a five player game. Cthulhu matches this wager plus one additional D6 dice. Whoever has the highest total roll receives all wagered sanity tokens. The player wins any draws.

"I was looking around BoardGameArena and thinking about how there are some games where the top players have way higher ELOs than other games, and I was wondering if we could put that data to use. Since ELO rating disparities show the likelihood of one player defeating another (for example, an ELO of 240 more than your opponent means you have an 80% chance of winning, while a 677 difference means a 99% chance of winning), it should be that games where players can attain 900+ ELOs on BGA are games where the winner is more determined by skill than games where the top players only get ELOs in the 400s.

So I decided to put together a table here with some of the most popular games on BGA and rank them based on the average ELO of the top ten players (I could not do Chess and Go, among others because BGA does not display top ELOs for those games, I assume due to ease of cheating). My understanding is these rankings only show players who have played fairly recently, so it isn't perfect, but I think it's still very useful. I did not just use the top player's ELO because I wanted to capture how much skill matters for the average player on BGA with each game. It's possible that the very top players only play a specific format which is more skill driven.  There can be other issues, for example, the top ranked Love Letter player has only played 24 times. Perhaps if that player played 1000 times their score would self-correct downwards. It could go up as well, but with only 24 games, the confidence that the rating is correct is not high. I think using a top ten average will get more at a breadth of gameplay.

I've included the ""Strategy"" and ""Luck"" rankings as listed on BGA for the games as well. There is a clear correlation between ELO rankings and strategy, as well as an inverse relationship between ELO rankings and Luck. There are significant outliers, however, like Stone Age is listed as 3 luck and 3 strategy, but has the third highest top ten ELO rankings. With 3.8 million games played on BGA, that's unlikely to be due to chance, but rather an accurate measure of the skill component in the game.

Let me know what you think!

"Hello all!
What started out as a ""I don't know what to get Xmas present"" several years ago has turned into a loved family tradition of a new boardgame every year.  5 years ago it started with carrasone(I know I misspelled it sorry) and since our collection grows every year by one or 2 games.  Normally a fun fast card type and a more heavy board game.  We have Catan, villainous( and a few expansions) last year was king of Tokyo which we enjoy a great deal.  Along with munchkin, sushi go, unstable unicorns. Plus classics like chess/checkers and battleship.  The family version of cards against humanity(daughter is 12). Looking for recommendations for this year's game. Normal players is 3. My daughter waxes us in Catan regularly so she counts as a adult. This year thinking Dominion for the card based one but I'd like something a lil heavier as well.  Catan seems to be our heaviest and looking for a 1-2 hour game that we can get into for a evening. Good varied strategy and works well with 3 players.  We have no issues being cut throat.

"I'm looking to open up a Board Game lounge in my area, and I wanted to see if there is anyone familiar with opening up one or you are a frequent board game enthusiast that could offer some insight.   


There are three in my area that are pretty good places, and they all serve alcohol; I want to not serve alcohol. Maybe a good offering of milkshakes?   


And I know most lounges have small fee for entrance like say $5 -- what do you all think of a membership model where instead of the $5 dollar, you pay $30 if you are a high school student and $45 if you are a college student? 

I know those are numbers are way lower than what I could make if I charged the $5, but how often does a person really go to a board game lounge, and if they pay a membership fee (free cancelation any time) they are more likely to go and pay for a milkshake or two, no? The revenue would probably come more from the food and drinks and possibly the sale of board games. 

Anyway, I have a drafted out business plan for all of this and it is certainly a work in progress right now, and before I can start to get things in motion, as gamers here, what are some things you look forward to or would like to see in a boardgame lounge?

My question is, is there any benefit to using multiplayer rules (does it enhance gameplay)? Or can I just throw my wife into the high seas and run the game while she captains the ship the whole time? For those who have played solo rules with more people, did you run into quarterbacking issues? For those who have played multiplayer, is paying command to use other peoples' crew on your turn really a compelling mechanic?

I'm thinking of getting in on the KS for the second print of the game since it seems a good price and the first edition seemed to be positively received.

I'm trying to get a copy of the Innovation card game and it's four expansions before Christmas, at a reasonable price.

"Im curious if other people have dealt with this issue. We have a regular gamer who I would say suffers from very low confidence and takes losses or any poor roll of the dice badly. He does his absolute best to ""pre-empt"" losses by telling the rest of the group ""I'm really tired today so I won't try hard to win"" or ""I had a really stressful week so I'll just play randomly today and I don't mind if you beat me."" Of course, he then will get very uppity if you attack him and occasionally curse and get pissed if he rolls badly. 

Ive talked to him about the anger issue a few times and has gotten it pretty well under control, but I've noticed an increase in the fear of trying due to the possibility of losing. 

The group is at a point where we play the game with him but if it's competitive at all we pretty much never attack him and occasionally just let him win. We've transitioned to almost 100% co-op games now due to the issue. Again, I think it's severe low confidence, and he will sometimes go off like ""of course I roll a 1, everything else in my life is shit so why not my dice rolls, too."" And we just try to move on.

Any ideas how to approach this? He's a friend and I've spoken to him multiple times about not taking these games too seriously (getting legit mad at a game of Catan is not the behavior of an adult).

"Hi everyone, I was wondering if anyone could help with some inconsistencies I’ve seen in YouTube tutorials that show the Rio Grande version of Bohnanza compared to the Amigo version. For the 6-7 player variant the Rio Grande version states to deal cards in a specific way, 3 to the first player, 4 to the second, 5 to the third, and 6 to everyone else. However the Amigo version states to give everyone 5 cards regardless of player order. Does this alteration make a big difference in gameplay? Why are they different? 

The other inconsistency is that in the 6-7 player variant, in the Amigo edition, during the 4th phase it is stated as such 

“Unlike in the base game every player draws one card from the draw pile, adding them to their hands behind the last card. Start with the active player and draw cards in a clockwise direction.”

The living room is only 17m2/183f2 (?), so not a lot of room for a big table and a couch etc.

I think our biggest group would be 5-6 people, so the 8 person width is not needed (but who knows when we can get a bigger house ;) ).

"I've been gaming since I was a kid with the standard stuff. Monopoly, Clue, Battleship, and The Game of Life. I played Gin and Gin Rummy with my grandfather and Pinochle with family. I even played Chess and was Chess champion in school 2 years running.

In the late 60's I got into war gaming with several Avalon Hill games like Richthofen's War, Wooden Ships and Iron Men, Panzer Blitz, and Blitzkrieg among others. I even went to a convention once :)

In the 70's I got into Role Playing with white box D&amp;D and the beginner blue box making dungeons and running friends through them when I was stationed in Germany.

As time went on and I returned to Virginia, I ran the gaming club at the post Recreation Center. I ran a ton of AD&amp;D, played board games like Cosmic Encounters, Talisman, and Car Wars, and hosted one gaming convention. I got into a few other RPGs as well like Paranoia and Shadowrun but mainly stuck with AD&amp;Dr1 with some r2 bolted on.

In the mid-90's gaming petered out where I lived and I got into Video Gaming. I almost sold off my collection at the time but it was a pretty low sum plus I would have had to pay shipping. Just not worth it.

In the mid-00's my ex pushed me to do something with all these game boxes in the corner of the bedroom. As I started going through the boxes, I reminisced about all the fun times. I happened to drop into a Hobby Town in the area and they had Paranoia XP for sale. Woah, that was cool. I checked on line and there seemed to be a ton of gaming going on. Video gaming with others wasn't doing it for me. I just didn't have the time to get as good as the kids on line. But table top gaming?

I got back into gaming, running a Shadowrun adventure arc for 6 years, checking out board games, and the like. My ex just couldn't understand why we would play games and had a hard time understanding the rules. Not dumb, just not a gamer.

Anyway, I started keeping track of what games I had in a database in part so I didn't pick up a game I already had :) 

I never sold any of my kit though. It's all on shelves in my game library. Over the course of a year games tend to get put on top of shelves or on the floor in front of the shelf it should be placed. As the year progresses, the floor gets a bit crowded. At the end of the year I'll reorder the shelves to put everything away and start over with the new year.

As of now, I have 5,000 Games and Accessories. This includes magazines including my The Dragon #1 and #2, White Dwarf #1, boxes of dice (I mean if I counted individual dice!), packs and promos, decks of cards, and even pins, my Shadowrun clipboard, and Shadowrun 'S' etched drinking glass. Oddly I didn't count t-shirts or posters as I have a few of those as well. This includes Role Playing Games of course.

I don't consider myself a collector. I'm not buying games for resale later or to keep them in perfect untouched shape. I do tend to get expansions though to complete the, well collection :) 

Have I played them all? Nope. A game looks interesting and I want to play and it's unlikely I'll find it again. Other games I pick up are a bit more complicated for my gamer wife (I still pick up war games). And some games she just doesn't like. We played Marvel Dice Throne last week and she wasn't too thrilled about it even though she won.

Oh, and the 5,000th game? Living Planet. I did just pick up Splendor Duel last night so my wife and I will play it tonight.

"Hello good folks, now call me crazy, this is just some brainstorming and I'd enjoy some opinions, if you're fine with giving yours. I love Dune Imp but I find the victory points limit to be a rather abrupt and thematically poor victory condition. I wonder if some of you have tried playing with a houserule that removes it, meaning you play the full ten rounds, until every conflict has been solved, and simply count the points everyone has afterwards to determine the winner ? The score marker would exceed the printed track for sure given how many VP the final battles grant, but I'm curious about the overall experience.

However, Heroes 3 being in the top 3 of my favorite pc games of all time I decided to look into the project a bit more. And after seeing the prototype preview video it looks pretty cool.

So it looks like the game's pretty much ready, but they're doing a kickstarter campaign with a 169€ pledge including all the expansions with miniatures for the game. The base game pledge is 75€. The $ prices should be around the same.

" I made my decisions based on the following factors:

* Interesting gameplay (possibility of interesting strategies, well balanced etc., sorry Monopoly)
* Conciseness (trade-off between simple rules and interesting gameplay)
* Visual aesthetics (e.g. trains in Ticket to Ride)
* Smaller playing time is better (if two games are equally interesting, the shorter game will be played more often)
* Diversity (e.g. Viniculture is low on the list because it's classical eurogame and similar to Wingspan)

So, we plan to rent the games in this order (numbers are average playing time and complexity from [boardgamegeek.com](https://boardgamegeek.com)):

1. **Ticket to Ride Europe** 45m 1.93
2. **Castles of Burgundy Original/Special Edition** 1h/1h+ 2.99
3. **7 Wonders 1/2/Duel** 30m 2.32
4. **Memoir44** 45m 2.27 (I just want to play some simple and aesthetically pleasant wargame)
5. **Pandemic Legacy: Season 1**  1h 2.83
6. **Wingspan** 55m 2.44
7. **Carcassonne** 40m 1.9
8. **Azul** 40m 1.76
9. **Klask** 10m 1.07
10. **Terraforming Mars** 2h 3.25

12. **Twilight struggle** 2h30m 3.6

"Hi r/boardgames, I run an indie board game publishing company. 

We built our own free to play, browser based (so nothing to download) digital implementation for our next game Sigil: [https://sigilbattle.com/](https://sigilbattle.com/).

I am extremely proud of the program. A lot had to go right to make it a reality. Some incredibly talented people put a lot of hard work into making it what it is – and we have even more functionality like automatic matchmaking coming down the pipeline. 

*\[If you check it out and are looking for a match, the best place to find other players is through* [*our discord*](https://discord.gg/vTSjFjydFE)*\]*

https://preview.redd.it/pqlv5jcgj4z91.png?width=3840&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=52d9d2a18d6837ebd3f778abfc2da34911138af1

And, to be candid – we punched massively above our weight with it. 

While most board games have some form of digital implementation, they are usually component ports into environments like Tabletop Simulator, Board Game Arena, or Tabletopia. 

You don’t typically see analogue games with their own platforms until they sell hundreds of thousands (or more) copies – the Wingspans, Spirit Islands, and Gloomhavens of the world. 

So, let’s talk about our thinking around the digital implementation, what we’re working on, and the circumstances that allowed us to pull it off. 

**Not All Ports are Equal**

A big part of an analogue game is the tactile experience. Not all games are created equal when it comes to how attractive and enjoyable a digital port would be. 

For instance, I think [Nut Hunt](https://www.pineislandgames.com/nuthunt) loses a good amount when translated digitally. Our [TTS](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2786047793) and [Tabletopia](https://tabletopia.com/games/nut-hunt-a-game-of-territorial-squirrels) mods are still a lot of fun, but a big part of the game is the social fun created around the fox, and the tactile experience of scatting squirrels. 

https://preview.redd.it/0t7sopnij4z91.png?width=2500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=277462897e98564126e03df2408fd26e755fc53e

A game like Gloomhaven ported well digitally, because although it loses the table presence, and a bit of that classic Talisman-esque dungeon crawl experience, it more than makes up for it by taking care of the rules enforcement and bookkeeping.  

Two player dueling games (like Chess or Magic: the Gathering) make some of the best digital ports. 

Strategic depth and tactical decision making aren’t sacrificed in digital implementations, so games that skew towards those player preferences (and [psychographics](https://www.pineislandgames.com/blog/demographicsanddesign)) should retain a lot of their appeal digitally. 

[ Sigil gamer preference profile ](https://preview.redd.it/ltk4akikj4z91.jpg?width=1666&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d3d81351c524b6da7334b2dd619af6d600e6960)

As a two player abstract strategy dueling game, Sigil skews heavily towards player psychographics that value strategic depth, and player conflict. In Magic: the Gathering terms – they are the Spikes. 

Because of our target audience, we expect competitive focused gamers to be a driver of interest in Sigil Online. 

One of the next features we’ll be rolling out is automatic matchmaking along with a ranked ladder. 

**Challenges of Automatic Matchmaking**

Right now, Sigil Online supports a simple single player mode (which is mostly there for getting used to the interface), and a private match system. 

Our next big implementation will be the roll out of automatic matchmaking. 

From a technical standpoint we have the functionality mostly in place (the back end is built, and we are improving some UX). 

The issue is queue times. 

https://preview.redd.it/g6ndbhnlj4z91.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f562388a7afb7ef683356b04139fabe4a853010

My gut is that queue times &gt; 3 minutes will be a turn-off for a lot of would-be fans, and obviously even shorter queue times are ideal. 

In order to ensure a high enough density of players on the platform, we’ll initially be opening automatic matchmaking and our ranked play ladder for limited periods. 

That is, we might open ladder matches from 6-10 EST/EDT on Thursdays (this is our current best guess based on alpha tester traffic). As our player base grows, we’ll expand ladder matches to additional time slots. 

We spent a lot of time thinking through the best way to ameliorate wait times for pairings. 

A lot of larger gaming companies follow one or both of two approaches:

1. They run bots which match once a player has been in queue for a certain period
2. They pair the launch with a large marketing push

Bots aren’t really our cup of tea. It takes time and capital to deploy *real feeling* bots, and we’d much prefer our players get to play other players. 

In terms of marketing – we’re an indie board game publisher - so, while we do have a marketing budget, our reach won’t be large enough to ensure a day one crowd in the \~4 thousand range that I’d estimate we’d need for consistent short queue times across geographies ([here is my math](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1im2BQjkyZ50U0XCaTQkwb940phMC1ZckHfTgk9Gl8hk/edit?usp=sharing)). 

What we do have is an incredible (and growing) community. 

And, over a smaller time window, it doesn’t take a ton of players to ensure reasonable queue times.

And, there’s something exciting about *Thursday Night Sigil*. I think it will be a great way to bring our community together around an event. 

As our numbers grow, and we can ensure short queue times across longer periods, we’ll expand when automatic matchmaking is open. 

**A Potential Powerful Marketing Tool**

A pillar of our marketing strategy for Sigil is to leverage the digital version to build a crowd for the analogue game launch – which we expect to Kickstart in \~March 2023. 

Once we launch automatic matchmaking / ranked play, we’ll be making a pretty concerted push to get people to check out the platform. 

This will include a modest sized twitch stream campaign, as well as some content on TikTok and our social media.

[ Mtg streamers like Reid Duke are a great example of the kind of audience we are targeting. Who would you like to see stream Sigil? ](https://preview.redd.it/dqi0siboj4z91.png?width=2221&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f41899640f581aa4181898c59c0fc8721d20e3e0)

Leaning on the digital platform as our primary marketing avenue is a real risk. It’s a relatively untested approach in the board game space. But, I think it’s the best way to get Sigil in front of as many people as we can. 

I have a huge amount of confidence in Sigil as a game. 

I believe there is a real audience of gamers who will fall in love with the digital implementation and will want an analogue version of what might be their favorite game. 

It’s now my responsibility to get it out there. And, to make it shine. 

**Why don’t more games have their own digital implementation?**

The short answer is cost. The longer answer is cost and expertise. 

Uploading game assets to something like Tabletop Simulator is pretty straight forward. Coding up a digital version of a game on your own platform can easily cost six-figures. Even a mechanically straight forward game like Sigil should cost tens of thousands of dollars (if not more). 

We are extremely fortunate with our partners on the project - Andreas Voellmer and Matt Stow -who made Sigil Online possible. 

Andy designed Sigil and happens to be an all-star developer at Google. Before we had acquired the rights to the game, he’d substantially developed the back end of a digital version (that is all the non-user facing programming). 

https://preview.redd.it/8x4u24uqj4z91.jpg?width=815&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e82d05cdadea4858c16650962572892a8a0e7963

Andy continued to put hundreds of hours into developing the platform and managed the overall technical process (which is way over my head). 

Matt Stow is managing the front end of Sigil Online, including all the animations, user interface, tutorial, and more. Under normal circumstances I’m doubtful that we could afford his expertise – but he is a friend of the company, already knew us through the Nut Hunt campaign and this Blog, and wanted to be a part of our project at a rate that we could make work. 

I am massively grateful to both Matt and Andy. 

Their expertise and hard work allowed us to create a product that is well outside of the reach of most indie board game publishers. 

And, I’m hopeful that I can live up to what they’ve created and use Sigil Online as a tool to introduce Sigil to the world.

"I remember when I first spotted Virtù cover picture somewhere online over a year ago now. I was instantly attracted to it as something about the cover and the slightly mysterious sounding name that is difficult to type with English keyboard made me interested in it more than I usually am about games that has very few published details about it yet. Over time I forgot about it - until it got released in US. Not being able to find English edition in Europe, I knew I had to import it from the States directly, hoping that it is worth it. Hoping that this will not be another one of those games I am excited about, paying a lot of good money for, then learning the rules and feeling that something is wrong and then feeling disappointed round after round that it is not exactly what I hoped for. Like a date that goes on for hours where with every passing hour you know that you never want to see that person again.

So, is Virtù good?

If you want a quick opinion? For me this is a brilliant game and my group loved it as well. If you like tight, interaction heavy eurogames with low amount of luck, if you like games where you can blame yourself while finding so many interesting strategic avenues to explore to tweak your engine to suit the needs of the current game state? This game just might be as great for you as it is for me.

But for everyone that is interested in some of the specific details why I have such a high opinion of it, here's my list of things:

**THE GOOD**

* The rondel. This game is in many ways like *Crusaders Thy Will Be Done*, but compared to that game the puzzle of the rondel, the ability of how to tweak it and how it feels thematically is just so much better. It might be the best game I've played with a dynamic rondel. The puzzle is better in every single way than it is in Crusaders. It's very interesting and at the same time incredibly flexible. And while mechanisms like this may sometimes seem abstract, here it is actually very thematic: the way how cards work and move on the engine has a sense of theme about it like trying to restructure or develop a working government. For example to have a new leader in palace that runs things, they cannot just be placed there, they have to first be familiar with the governing model by staying in the outskirts, working sort of like councelors and lower level government employees. Only then, once they understand the system, can they take a leadership role. Sometimes a card may be useful as a councelor directly for a leader in the palance, but sometimes they are better to work outside the balance for more flexible, tactical jobs. And it is so very good that sometimes you regret the decision either way you make it! The rondel also feels ""bureaucratic"" in exactly the right way.

* The scheming and the agents system is an absolute masterpiece of a layer that makes this games systems feel alive in ways few euros do. Being able to send sneaky agents to everywhere across the game mechanisms - or using agents to defend you from such acts, is just both thematic and very addictive. Being able to manipulate opponents leader in their government so they are prohibited from being effective? At the right time it works and that well timed dagger may be more sharp and painful than having armies march on your cities. What makes this system so brilliant is that you are limited in agent pieces, you cannot have too many of them, so you have to have your agents in the right place at the right time. At the same time moving your existing agents is very expensive since you have to pull them secretly out of the system first. This is such an elegant system that I wish games like Dune Imperium had anything close to it. Designers? Learn from what the author has done here. It can bring otherwise abstract-seeming euro-mechanisms alive.

* This game manages to perfectly balance the ""playing with my engine"" vs ""playing against my friends"". Not many games are able to feel so interesting from your own play and tweaks, while at the same time also being interactive multiplayer game. What is done so very well here is that you feel like you have to react to what other players are doing and where. But what other players are doing does not dominate everything that you are doing, you are free to explore your own avenues and finding brilliance in combinations that perhaps instead make other players react to you. This dance works so very well here.

* Combat system and the army system in the game is designed exactly right. It is not too dominant in the game and you may have games where players do not even directly attack other players. But the way it is designed - where you have a more freeform opportunity to move armies with ships while more restricted in land movement - is wonderfully elegant. The way combat is resolved is also easy to understood with none of the ""a'ha no you can't"" surprise reveals and special effects of other games that get too stuck with combat. I am really glad it is designed in a way where it is a viable strategy, it is a threat, but never dominant to topple the rest of the systems.

* This is a very deterministic game, as in there is no randomness and all of the surprises are only ever introduced by players and their moves themselves. In the beginning you see all the cards you may purchase (and there are a lot of them, allowing for a lot of different strategies) and there is no randomness introduced by the shuffled cards in the game. This makes this game clearly one where it matters a lot how well you can do as a player, as no lucky die rall or drawn card is going to act as a [i]great equalizer.[/i] Instead the qualizer are strategies of other players and a few well placed agents, making sure never to place all eggs in one basket - as a good leader really should. This aspect of interaction also helps restrict emergence of dominant strategies that often can happen with strongly deterministic games. While I do not often love games like this, preferring a good mix of randomness in my games, it works very well here.

* ...and! While deterministic games that allow for interaction also mean that players can pile on the leader, here it is not so as piling on a leader would mean too many changes to your own system. Essentially it would mean deflating your own tires. So while you may understand who is ahead, you are focused on finding how to best them with your system and at most a single well placed agent. It is a rare sight for a game like this not to feel like a king of a hill and this is all thanks to how important it is to have your rondel be effective where quick and sharp aggressive changes are detrimental to your own progress. Except that brilliantly placed agent. Chef's kiss!

* This game also implements a ""loan mechanism"" in a fascinating way. First of all, I love the aspect of taking loans in games, because it gives you a bit of a ""no seatbelt"" style gameplay and added depth to strategic options. And the way it works in Virtù is implemented in the way I find very enjoyable: you can take an ""indulgence"" card on your turn that gives you a good kickstart money or a very good resource icon that is hard to have multiples of to purchase higher cards or titles to your engine. But the risk is that it locks down your current action card and limits you from using that location on your wheel until you have paid back the loan. This means that taking ""indulgence"" is never an easy decision and it is costly to pay off, but at the right time it can be just the right kind of temptation!

* There's been some early talk about the game having a quick player action phase (spring) and a very slow round end phase (winter). My experience has shown that spring and winter phases are similar in length and winter does not bog down the game in later rounds. It made me wonder if some other players are playing the winter phase ""palace reorganization"" wrong, as it not as freeform or loose to result in that much analysis paralysis. In my games the winter phase was definitely not slow or slower than I would expect, often taking mere minutes.

* This game looks visually really good. What I liked about the early box art and the work of the artist is there throughout the game graphic design and cards. While the cards and characters may seem somewhat similar from one card to another, I really like that they did not go some strange ""cartoonish"" or ""humorous"" route. The game manages to look respectful for the theme without trying to be too flashy and the style of art is nice to look at.

* Last but not least for things that I love: it is so very tight. I love eurogames that feel like a knifefight in a phonebooth. Terra Mystica is so incredibly brilliant and every game that makes me tingle in the way Terra Mystica does, deserves all the praise. I just want to play it again, to do all things differently and then realize that I am stumbling even more than before. I love games where I love the experience even when I am not doing well, finishing dead last. Wonderful!

**THE BAD**

* The player boards are a little thin. They would benefit from being a thicker punchboard type of material than just a large slim cardboard.

* While I find replayability of the game pretty great as the game has a very strongh emergent strategy pointed above, I wish that the starting cards could be a little more variable in this game. It doesn't bother me, but if there is one thing that I would love is that I could play an infinite amount of potential combinations of starting characters, for example with a draft between players. But is really MY weird quirk than anything actually bad.

* The only aspect of the game that felt slightly not as well polished as I would have expected was the ""alliances"" system, which is a separate mini-area on the game board. While it is not necessarily out of place, my group has mostly ignored it, deeming other investments worth the effort a little more. But this may also be just the early meta of my group.

**THE UGLY**

* In all honesty, this game is very empty of everything that I wish was done better. The only aspect that slightly bothers me is that the soldier meeples are lightweight, tiny and fiddly. But that's just about it!

**9/10**

It seems that this is the designers first game. I can't wait to see what else he will design in the future. Wonderful! So very-very good :)

"I've come to learn that Miniature Market's shipping delays are well understood by the community, but I wanted to add that there is still uncertainty even if your order is ""shipped.""  

Like many other commentators, I was previously very satisfied buying from Miniature Market.  I have made somewhat regular purchases for eight years, in fact.  But no more.

As others have noted, delays in shipping have gone on for months and emails go unanswered for a week.  Today I got news that while one of my purchases was finally marked as shipped (it was combined with another order), the warehouse is actually out of inventory so they will start the refund process.  But after all this waiting, that product is very difficult to find elsewhere.  So if I still want to buy it, the price has gone up significantly.  Most frustratingly, the item is \*still\* listed as in stock on Miniature Market's webstore.  I should have just paid a little more somewhere else; I would have had the item a lot sooner and ultimately cheaper than what it'd cost now.

"Hi everyone,

I would like to get the game Quacks of Quedlinburg, but unfortunately, every copy I've played has had the same problem.  After just a few plays, the game tokens get grubby and nasty, full of skin flakes and oils.

I've seen some upgrades online, like acrylic replacement tokens, coin holders, etc.  However, I recently discovered this [craft glaze](https://www.michaels.com/aleenes-original-craft/10659201.html), a paintable adhesive that dries to a hard shell.  I'm wondering, has anyone tried something like this as a DIY game upgrade?  

I intend to paint a few of my wingspan tokens with this to see what the results would be like.  Perhaps it would be a low-cost (albeit labor intensive) alternative to the other upgrade options I've seen for Quacks.

Hello,

I have created a LOTR munchkin board game, with over 240+ cards. I personally custom designed everything and I am happy so far with what I have, although I would like to continue to improve the cards. I will post some samples without giving too much away.

My hope is that the Munchkin folks will team up with Warner Brothers and be inspired to create an official version of this game ((or whoever owns LOTR) . I will reach out to them and send them a copy of my set.

I wanted to print the cards out professionally, but they could not print the backside since I put ""The Lord of the Rings"" for copyright issues, understandably. I will just remove it. Nonetheless I printed a cardstock version of the entire set and have been testing it to balance out the game. It has been tremendous fun! More than I expected. I put a lot of work at making the spells and ability match the LOTR movies including The Hobbit and the Ring of Power show.

Anyways, if all else fails and Munchkin people do not want to do anything with it I will release it to the public on here or somewhere. I might also release the Photoshop project files so you can edit them to whatever you like.

Not sure if this is something people want but I figured I'd put it out there.

What do you guys think?

What mechanisms do you think can work with a LOTR version?

Any input is appreciated! I just joined twitter last week, (15 years late lol) so I will post any updates though there. I literally have no followers :/

Maybe one day I will work on a Star Wars version? Who knows, thanks again, cheers.

"So this is a long drawn out story that I won't get into the entirety of it, but about six years ago I was at the worst point in my life.  I was abusing Xanax and alcohol, and basically blacked out for a year of my life after an ugly divorce.  During the Xanax binges I became a kleptomaniac.  I was really into board games and 40K so I would steal from a FLGS and boost my army or board game collection.  I was finally caught and got the police called, went to court got a diversion, tried to go back to my life.  I didn't think about the consequences of my actions when I was doing this, but the theft got me banned at like four places in our city, and shunned by the local 40k community.

It definitely was a wake up moment and I went on a path to get to sobriety.  So that being said I can say now I'm clean and sober from pills, no more theft, I do still have the occasional beer, and I've been working consistently for four years now.  I also over the years have gotten rid of anything I had ever stolen.  It's a clean slate for me.

So now I'm finally getting the balls to go back on meetup and try and rejoin the board game community specificay.  One of the places they play at is a place where I am not allowed at so if I show up to all the meetups except that one I'm sure people may start asking questions.

That leads me to my question and guidance from my favorite community.  Knowing I have a history should I reach out to the group organizers and just give them a heads up?  Or should I just not bring it up at all?  I'm worried with the overlap of board gaming and 40k I will run into the community I burned all my bridges in, and they may not have good things to say to me.

Maybe I'm over thinking all of this.  A few people know ive moved on and have grown to be a better person, but the owners of two of the stores have attacked me on social media before.

One of my big problems with the game is that you only draw one card per turn, which really limits your decision making. Usually, there’s a pretty obvious right move for each turn.

"My girlfriend and I have been playing a lot of different games lately (especially after the annual board game conference in Utrecht, NL) and my eye has especially fallen on the Mysterium games (the normal and Mysterium Park) and Obscurio. I just love the artstyle of both games and this is one of the things that makes me incredibly excited to play them! Not only that, but I just love the idea of solving a mystery with my girlfriend and friends or the mystical feeling of trying to escape from a certain level. It's really cool!

We have 2 friends who occasionally come over for game night (once a month if their schedule allows) and I'm sure they will like Mysterium, Mysterium park and Obscurio as well. They like games with a challenge and would rather play games that last an hour than games that only last a few minutes. One of these friends plays Dungeons and Dragons every week, so I'm sure he will have no problem understanding these games.

But I was wondering if these games are good for 2 players and which of these games is the most 'beginner friendly'? My girlfriend and I want to be able to play these games even when our friends are not around. It would be a shame if we can only play these kinds of games with our friends and they stay in the closet when we want to do a game for 2 players. I understand that there is no traitor in Obscurio by playing with 2 people, but is the game still fun if you play it with 2 people or does the game then lose its whole purpose? We both are casual gamers and we can handle harder games but we have a limit on how many rules apply to one game at once. For example we absolutely could not play Andor as we thought that was WAY to difficult (laugh at us, we don't care....). So which game is the easiest?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance! I am still hesitating which game of the 3 mentioned I should get. They are all currently on sale (Mysterium is 30 euros, Mysterium Park is 21 euros and Obscurio is also 30 euros) so maybe I'll treat myself to an early Christmas present. I don't really like Dixit's asteichs but from what I read it is similar to the rest of the games mentioned.","Which game is the best 'beginner friendly'of these 3: Obscurio, Mysterium and Mysterium Park?",1,self.boardgames,yqhr7j,XxLockdownZxX,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/yqhr7j/which_game_is_the_best_beginner_friendlyof_these/,1667997296

" My girlfriend and I have been playing a lot of different games lately (especially after the annual board game conference in Utrecht, NL) and my eye has especially fallen on the Mysterium games (the normal and Mysterium Park) and Obscurio. I just love the artstyle of both games and this is one of the things that makes me incredibly excited to play them! Not only that, but I just love the idea of solving a mystery with my girlfriend and friends or the mystical feeling of trying to escape from a certain level. It's really cool!

We have 2 friends who occasionally come over for game night (once a month if their schedule allows) and I'm sure they will like Mysterium, Mysterium park and Obscurio as well.

"I would like to start off by saying I am in no way affiliated with First Fish Games or their current Kickstarter. I am writing this review because this is a game my friends and I really enjoy and want to get more eyes on. The company, First Fish Games, has been very helpful to me. When my original copy of the game was missing cards, their communication and timeliness were excellent. When I saw their post mentioning that they were looking for content creators to cover their upcoming expansion, “The Bugs and Slugs Expansion”, I asked if I could cover it as well and they graciously sent me a prototype for me to review. You can check out the game on [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1812622835/ducks-in-tow-the-bugs-and-slugs-expansion-and-re-print) now.

[https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1812622835/ducks-in-tow-the-bugs-and-slugs-expansion-and-re-print](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1812622835/ducks-in-tow-the-bugs-and-slugs-expansion-and-re-print)

Ducks in Tow, published by First Fish Games, is a family weight, Pickup and Deliver and Set Collection game for 1-4 players. You are moving around the park to feed ducks so they befriend and follow you, and once they are following you it is your task to bring them to their favorite location.

**Gameplay**

The objective of Ducks in Tow is to have the most points at the end of the game. You score points by escorting ducks to specific spots on the board to complete location cards. Location cards have four ducks (one of each color) in a column and those ducks are either a solid color or an outline. The solid color ducks indicate the ducks required to be following you for completing the location card. When completed, the location card is placed in front of you and you score points by creating lines of connected, solid color ducks on each of the four rows. An additional way to score points is to have a specific pattern of ducks on your location cards to complete a formation card. The game plays in roughly 45 minutes and ends once a player has completed a certain amount of location cards based on player count, or all formation cards have been claimed.

On your turn you have multiple different actions you can choose from: moving, feeding a duck, “shaking the bag” (drawing a random duck from a bag and either keeping it or later adding it to the board), gain food of your choice, drop ducks off at a location to complete location cards and add them either to the left or right of an existing location card, draw cards from a shared pool or randomly from the deck, claiming a formation card, or “adopting a duck” (adding a wooden duck piece to one of the duck outlines on your location card and discarding a different duck). You have 4 actions per turn and you can repeat actions as long as you meet the requirements. At the end of your turn, any ducks you removed from the board that are not being used on a location card are then returned to the board. This part of your turn is called “dispersing the ducks”. 

**My Opinions on Gameplay**

The games my group enjoys the most tend to be games that are light on rules but have different strategies and options throughout the game. We have exceptions of course, and we do play a large range of different games, but the games that appeal to us the most would be considered medium weight games. Ducks in Tow is on the lighter side of medium, but I think it can appeal to the casual gamers as well as those looking for something a little more. There is player interaction in terms of taking ducks from the board, and when you are dispersing the ducks to the board you potentially have decisions to make on where they go, which can help you and hinder other players. Gameplay is solid in this one, you never feel like you have nothing to do and there are plenty of decisions to be made, without being overwhelming or stressful. If you don’t get the duck you need, there are ways to change paths without the game being delayed or ruined for you. When other people take the ducks you need, it doesn’t feel like they were purposefully being malicious as well, so people who don’t like direct conflict shouldn’t have an issue with this type of interaction. The set collection and pick up and deliver elements are nothing specifically new, but they way they are implemented work very well and are extremely thematic.

My main piece of criticism for the gameplay is that the game can feel a little fiddly. There are moving parts around the general gameplay that you need to make sure you follow, and it can be a little confusing at first. After 1 or 2 games though this goes away, but it does make it a tad more difficult to teach. 

The game length feels perfect for this type of game; it never overstays its welcome while also not feeling too short. It is very quick to set up; you place tiles to create the board based on the number of players, add ducks to the board, draw seeds and cards, display the formation cards based on the number of players, and you’re ready to go.

It is worth mentioning that I have only played the game with two and three players. I think it works very well for both, but it was a little more enjoyable with three. There is a solo mode as well but I cannot speak on that as I have not tried it.

**Components, Art, and Theme**

The components in this game are excellent. The game contains screen printed wooden ducks, wooden pieces shaped like seeds, screen printed bags to hold the pieces, plastic player pieces with trays to hold the ducks following you, thick tiles used to create the board, transparent formation cards to lay on top of the location cards, and the location cards themselves which are of very good quality. I have heard some people report that the plastic trays to hold the ducks can be difficult to work with and the ducks will either pop out or not stay in place, but I personally have not had this issue with any of the four trays in my copy. The rulebook is also good with examples and clear sections on where certain rules are, but the player reference cards the game includes are really not that helpful. The symbols/pictures on the reference cards don’t make sense and actually can cause more confusion unless you understand the rules, and once you do the game is simple enough where you don’t need them. This also may not matter to most people, but it is worth mentioning that the box size is a medium sized square box. If shelf space is a premium for you like it is for me, it is important to know that it does not take up much space at all.

The art in this game, created by Andrew Bosley, is also excellent. I was not a backer of the original Kickstarter campaign, and I did not know the game existed until I was watching a video review for a different game and saw it displayed on a shelf behind the reviewer. Once I saw it, I was intrigued with the art and the theme, did a little research, and ordered a Kickstarter copy off eBay. All of the art in the game is vibrant and full of life and enhances the game without being distracting. Everything on the board and location cards are clear so there is never a question on what a symbol or color may represent. The game is also color-blind friendly and uses symbols with each color. 

The theme is very unique and fits very well with what you are doing in the game. You collect food, walk to different parts of the park to feed the ducks, then using the plastic tray they follow you as you take them to their favorite location. Personally, I find theming to be a crucial factor in games. I would rather have good gameplay with a well implemented theme than outstanding gameplay with an unappealing or generic theme. This game has a theme I haven’t seen before and it is well implemented with the gameplay. The theme also can appeal to a wide range of people, I would think a large percentage of people at some point in their lives have gone to a pond at the park and watched or fed the ducks. If you do feed ducks in the future, I recommend lettuce or kale, oats, corn, and seed instead of bread. Bread is not good for animals.

**Expansions**

There is one existing expansion and one upcoming expansion. I was fortunate enough to try a prototype copy of the upcoming expansion so I can provide my thoughts on that.

***The Angry Goose Expansion***

This is a small expansion that adds more location cards to the main deck. The gimmick here is that instead of trying to complete rows of ducks on your cards, you are instead trying to leave blank spaces (the outlined ducks) left and the right of geese which now appear in place of a duck on the card. You get a few points per goose that meets this criteria. This expansion is by no means essential, but it adds another method of scoring and more decisions to the game while adding barely any complexity. One thing I really appreciate about this new scoring method is that it is not too weak and not overpowered. Several games introduce expansions which add new scoring objectives that either are pointless or way too good. These location cards with the geese are seamlessly added and you can do just as well as someone without geese in their played location cards. If you enjoy the base game, I recommend this expansion. 

***The Bugs and Slugs Expansion\****

*\*Disclaimer - all thoughts are based on a prototype copy and are subject to change. All art and components are subject to change.*

This is the first major expansion for Ducks in Tow which adds, you guessed it, bugs and slugs to the game (for the rest of the review I will refer to them as “bugs”). It also adds a new type of card that can be used to score ducks and add new player abilities to the game. The final component the expansion adds is a small player board that gives each player a scoring condition if bugs are assigned to the board, an asymmetric player power, and a specific place for ducks that are to be dispersed at the end of the turn. The expansion comes in a small box with amazing art, and the contents can fit comfortably in the core box.

Bugs are placed on the board during setup, two per tile with one on top of another. The bugs come in three different colors: green, gray, and purple. On your turn when you either draw a duck from the bag (“shake the bag”) and don’t keep assign it to follow you, complete a location card, or add a duck to your location cards and discard the other, these ducks that normally would be dispersed are placed in one of the three spots depending aforementioned action taken. Each of the spots with ducks are then dispersed back to the board at the end of your turn and you can take the top bug of one spot in which a duck was placed. You can do this for each of the three spots, however if you disperse two ducks from one spot, you only get one bug. Bugs that are claimed are placed on either the new duck cards or on your player board. Once a duck card is completed by having two bugs matching the required colors, you gain a one-time use ability that you can use on the current or a future turn, score bonus points at the end of the game (one point per two ducks in a row of the color on the card), and draw a new duck card. Once the ability is used, bugs are dispersed following standard disbursement rules, with the only exception being the bug goes on top of the other instead of just being added to the board like the ducks.

This expansion adds a new layer of gameplay without adding too much overhead, setup, or complexity. There is not a lot of physical content in the expansion box, but it does add a meaningful amount of decision making to the game. You now more than ever have to plan where you end your turn, you can not disburse ducks in a spot with another player so if you only have one purple bug available on the board and it is in a spot you need to be in, you have to plan around that. This sounds like it would be a rare circumstance, but it happened during my plays often enough to consider. You also can choose to not use the abilities and hoard the bugs on your boards so other players can’t use them, but then you miss out on a powerful ability. The scoring from the duck cards allow you to score more points than you could in the base game without being too overpowered. You probably need some points off these cards if other players are completing them, but with a combination of these points and standard scoring methods you can be competitive. 

There is a scoring objective on your player board as well, and it is the same for all players. You score your smallest row with at least one duck from your location cards twice (once per the standard scoring and once again for this), and it costs two bugs to complete this. During my plays this never generated more points than one of the new duck cards, and it was always worth assigning bugs to a duck card because it netted more points and an ability, but I could see with careful planning how it could be worth a lot of points.

I really like parts of this expansion, and was not sure about other parts. I think the new duck cards with the one-time abilities and scoring conditions are an excellent addition, and the new ways of interacting with the board, the bugs, and other players add a lot of strategy to the game. I also like how little it adds to the setup and overhead. You could teach the game with the expansion but you also could ignore it for someone’s first play and still enjoy the base game. The abilities are also powerful, but there are only four of them so you almost always can get one you want. The difficult part is getting the ability you want and the duck color you want, and you often have to make a decision by choosing one or the other.

I was not as sold on the player boards. I did really like the spaces to allocate ducks for disbursement based on the action taken to acquire the ducks. This worked really well and provided even more options on your turn, you could take an action that normally wouldn’t be as beneficial at the time so you could also get a bug. The scoring ability on the board to score your smallest row twice was a good concept, and I think you could make it work, but it costs the same as a duck card which also provides an ability and is easier to score with. The only thing I disliked was the asymmetric player abilities. They can be used every turn and some are clearly more powerful than others. After trying them out a few times, my group and I were able to rank the abilities based on their strength, and none of them seemed equal. As I continue to play with the expansion, I will probably either ignore the player abilities, limit them to once per game, or if there is a player who tends to score lower give them the better ability. It is important to mention that the creators have since changed the player abilities to balance them, I am not sure what they were changed to but my opinion on these should improve once I have the final product.

Even though I didn’t love everything in the box, the parts I did enhanced an already great game and added more strategy, decision spaces, and scoring conditions without adding any time to the game length and barely any overhead. I would highly recommend this one if you already like the base game. 

**Summary**

Ducks in Tow is a medium-light weight game that has a great theme, fantastic art and components, and I think will appeal to a large amount of people. It seems that many of the games that come out now are heavy Euro games, miniature filled games, or party games, so it is great to see games like this that can appeal to a larger mass of people. If you prefer playing games that are very heavy then this isn’t the game for you. But if you like games on the lighter side, need more gateway or gateway plus games, like games with a unique and well-implemented theme, or just like birds and ducks, then this game is well worth your time. I think this small publisher’s game deserves to be recognized for its interesting and engaging gameplay, unique theme, and high quality components. I hope everyone who is interested in this game gets a chance to play it, and the reprint as well as the “Bugs and Slugs Expansion” is currently on Kickstarter: [https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1812622835/ducks-in-tow-the-bugs-and-slugs-expansion-and-re-print](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1812622835/ducks-in-tow-the-bugs-and-slugs-expansion-and-re-print)",Ducks in Tow Review - With Expansions (Currently on Kickstarter),1,self.boardgames,ypwtbk,JetsFly228,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/ypwtbk/ducks_in_tow_review_with_expansions_currently_on/,1667937641

"For those who don't know, Unconscious Mind is a medium-heavy Euro game about the early days of Freudian psychoanalysis. You discuss ideas with other scholars, sip coffee, walk around Vienna, publish articles, and help clients resolve their grief by analyzing their dreams. 

The look and table presence of this game is remarkable. Vincent Dutrait provides all the art for the characters and historical setting while Andrew Bosley's art expresses the surrealistic dreams of the clients. If you've seen Fantasia's game Endless Winter, then you know what to expect from the production. It's absolutely top-notch. 

For what it's worth, I'm a game designer (PARKS, Cosmoctopus, etc.) and I think this game's design is truly special. In fact, I find it inspiring. The design team of Yoma, Laskas, Antonio Zax, and Jonny Pac have outdone themselves. Everyone who worked on this project should be proud.

"**Skull King** deserves all its accolades. It brought trick taking, an almost alien concept, to my family. Culturally, we're exposed to ladder/shedding type games, and even meld-type games. Trick taking was only familiar to those who had used computers back in the 90s-00s through Hearts.

Gameplay eases players into the rules through the slowly escalating hand size. The graphics are striking enough that you won't mistake a card for any other than what it is (trumps are black, numbers are green/yellow/purple, symbols are also clear), but we found that we had wanted another image for the namesake of the game. Perhaps someone more menacing or more sinister or more... evil?

Game info below:
A collaborative card game made for 2-4 players. 

Bunker Buddies: A nuke has gone off and destroyed the world. You and your friends are held out in a bunker doing your best to survive. Each day brings new challenges and struggles as you try to gain supplies, find and fix the radio, and call for help from the military. Will you make it to rescue or will you succumb to the new threats of the land? 

Set-Up: Players pick their character and receive 5 supply cards. They select one item to keep for sure after the nuke. The first round is always the nuke explosion event and everyone loses one supply at random and radiation poison is set to 1.  

Rounds: Each round a card from the events pile will be played, and the action on the card is to be taken first (Unless for The Survivalist Exception), players then gather any supplies earned on this round and use their turn to play one supply card. However, the bunker only has so much space and players must drop supplies to get back down to 5 cards before moving on (The Prepared must only go down to 6).

Ending the Game: The game ends when all players are dead or radiated, or the bunker collapses. If players can gather all parts of the radio and build it before death they will be able to signal for help and activate the military intervention card for rescue and win the game. 

Radiation Poison: Players can become poisoned by the radiation. Certain expeditions have a risk of radiation and so does fighting mutated animals. Can be cured with Rad-Ex meds,  but be careful there is not a lot of Rad-Ex left in the world use it wisely. If a player becomes too poisoned they are considered radiated and kicked out of the bunker until they are able to receive a dose of Rad-Ex.

Health: Players have a health bar to watch. The world is a terrifying, dangerous place now and venturing out on certain expeditions can be dangerous so watch your step. Intruders will always try to lower your health, after all, how else will they rob you? Can be brought up by health supplies so long as you have them. 

Bunker Stability: This is where you live now, it’s your only shelter and naturally the housing market no longer exists. Take good care of your bunker because if your shelter falls apart you’re left in the wasteland with nothing certain to succumb to radiation and death.

Expeditions: Excursions to the world above. These trips offer the ability to gain more supplies, but be careful, they also pose threats to your health and radiation. 

Intruders: From raiders to mutated animals, these attackers are here for battle. However, defeating them offers the chance to pillage their bodies for supplies.

Day of Rest: A (hopefully) quiet day in the bunker. A chance to relax and perhaps build up some health again. Most likely no supply gathering unless you get lucky cleaning the various nooks and crannies of the bunker for the hundredth time. 

Characters:
The Prepared: Gets an extra supply slot and has one additional card for the entire game.
The Scared: Panics at intruders and automatically loses one heart, but their desire to pretend everything is fine gives new outcomes for expeditions and day of rest cards.
The Survivalist: Strong against intruders, can use a supply before the intruder’s effect occurs, certain supplies are extra strong in the survivalist's hands.
The Doctor: Has the ability to heal, and health supplies played by the doctor gain an extra heart. If the doctor’s health is above 5 they are able to heal one player by one each round.",Advice for Holiday Present,1,self.boardgames,ypq23h,RepresentativeSoup84,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/ypq23h/advice_for_holiday_present/,1667922462

"Hey everybody,

&amp;#x200B;

Me and my friends played a murder mystery game for the first time. We tried ""Culinario mortale, Murder Overboard"". We were a group of 7 and were somewhat disappointed from that specific game.

From all the 7 characters, only 3-4 were relevant, the story of the rest did no contribute much and they didn't get to talk a lot.

The overall story was rather plain and I, who played the murderer, didn't have to hide that much or lie so much, nobody suspected me...there were not so many twists or surprises...could be that it was from our lack of experience in that type of game.

I would love for a recommendation for a more dynamic murder mystery game, where all characters get an equal role of sorts. I even heard about games where the murderer doesn't know they are the murderer at first, which sounds like a cool concept.

We will be 5 players in this case.

Anybody has a tip about the matter?

"On long car rides, we used to play a word game where two people would count down from 3 and attampt to say the same word(s) at the same time. Usually the first 2 players to start a round would say 2 different words. If players 1/2 didn't match, play would move to players 2/3. Players would try to say the same word at the same time based on the last 2 words. As play continued the group would eventually converge on one word.

Example
- Player 1 says ""football""
- Plyaer 2 says ""ocean""
Next group
- Player 2 says ""game""
- Player 3 says ""polo""
Next grouo
- Player 3 says ""water""
- Plyaer 4 says ""water""

Players 3/4 match and are awarded 1 point each and kick off the next round. This game was the inspiration for Words of a Feather.

We played another one that we called ""the finger game"". It definitely can be used as a drinking game but we would just play casually. 

All players would place their fingers on an object (usually a cup). On a player's turn they would count down, ""3-2-1."" Immediately after saying ""1"", these things happened simultaneously:
- All players could either remove their finger from the cup or keep it on
- The active player says a number

If the number the active player says matches the number of fingers on the cup, they make it to the next round and no longer put their finger on the cup. The last person in the round is eliminated. Play continued until there's one player left standing. When I introduced this game to my dad, he told told me that this is a derivation of the 3000 year old Italian game, ""Morra.""

"I've watched a couple of videos to see how people play Oil Slicks, and it seems EVERYONE is doing it wrong?

If you enter an oil slick, you're supposed to keep on sliding, **literally**... I've seen players move only ONE MORE space, which is incorrect. Based on the rule book:

When a Mech, Minion, or Bomb  moves onto an Oil Slick, **it keeps  moving in the same direction until it  collides with a wall, obstacle or the  edge of the board**.

You **have to slide** all the way until you hit something as specified above, not just one more space. You may literally slide the entire map, you may slide even like 10 spaces. This applies to minions and bomb as well. This makes the Mission #4 especially hard to beat.

&gt;!I literally just had to verify this specifically for that Mission 4, as it seemed impossible that minions spawn and slide to the end of the map, making you lose the game instantly if you're  in the wrong position.!&lt;

* I think the Deluxe edition also had some special trays for each player where everything they needed was in the tray and it could be packed more or less without hassle after the game and was good to go again once it was time for the next game.
* The players might have been playing as mages?
* I think there was a worker-placement mechanic in the game but I might be wrong.
* I think upgrades might have been done in the tray I mentioned earlier, but this might also be wrong.

Is it a measure of how badly you want to play the game again?  
Is it now much variability the game offers?  
Is it something to do with how much value you get out of the game?  


It's obviously something that is derived from a subjective opinion, but also something that seems to fuse together several different points of observation, not just a single one.  


So how do you define it? And does it make sense to you, to learn ""how much replayability"" someone thinks a game offers, without further elaboration of what that means to them? Would you be able to use that information on it's own?

"Hi everyone 😊

Has anyone tried both **Quest** and **Avalon Big Box**?

I think the creators of both games did a [lousy job](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ibcgames/quest-avalon-deluxe) explaining all the differences, even on their website, I can seem to find both games.

For as long as I understand, **Quest** is just a simplified version of **Avalon** with different rules, to make it more streamlined/simple/shorter.

On the other hand, **Avalon Bix Box** sounds like the base **Avalon** game with more roles, new rules, and a ton of new stuff (that in my opinion overcomplicates the game).

A good example of what I'm ""complaining"" is the fact that they don't specify which character roles both versions have, I just noticed that **Quest** doesn't have Merlin for example, which is a **must-have** character in my opinion.

Please tell me your thoughts in case you tried both or if you know more about them.

"I am not talking about Kickstarters TOS but about the ""Terms and conditions"" sections at the bottom of Kickstarter pages.

I just checked the Kickstarter for ""The thinning veil"" and at the bottom found this litle nugget:

""If you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of notification, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment[...]""

I've seen these or similar terms on many Kickstarters lately and always avoided those campaigns because if I read that right the creator says ""Hey we gave your pledge to the postman and if it gets lost/destroyed/damaged/whatever thats your problem""... do I read that wrong? 

Anyway I wonderd: Do you guys agree to those terms and hope for the best? Why would a creator chose to write these terms without intentions to use them against their backers? If I order from a shop title and risk passes onto me upon delivery not upon sending (so if something gets lost the shop files damages with the postal service they picked ). Am I misunderstanding those terms?

I know Kickstarters come with pretty low consumerprotections in place, but makeing backers responsible to deal with messed up deliveries seems wrong as it only causes more work and trouble for everyone involved?

"Even though my partner sometimes will indulge me, board games really are more my hobby than hers. However, occasionally I will find a game that will spark her interest as well, and we'll be playing the game over and over. Most recently that has been Sea Salt and Paper, but it was My City before that. Was being the operant word in that sentence, more on that later. 

My City, for those unaware, is a polyomino legacy game by the only true and living doctor, Reiner Knizia. I will be avoiding most spoilers, but will make vague allusions to developments in the game when necessary. I will also be transparent up front in saying that this review is much more about the feeling of the game and our experience rather than an in-depth mechanical exploration. In a nutshell, the game uses a bingo-type mechanic that dictates what piece needs to be placed on each of the player board each round, with changing scoring conditions and rules as the games progress. 

I'm not usually one to write negative reviews, mostly because I don't really spend that much time playing games that illicit a negative response from me. So why take the time to write one about My City (and yes - this will be a negative review)? Because my response did not start off negatively. On the contrary - we both absolutely loved the game. 

When we first got My City, we would absolutely fly through the envelopes. My partner doesn't normally play games back to back, but she wanted to play this one again and again. We played through the first envelope in one sitting, and the next one as well. Stickers were placed, playstyles were established and asymmetry was created. And then we ran into the problem that would ultimately poison the game for us - final scoring. 

My partner is not stupid. On the contrary; one of the reasons our relationship works is because she is really smart. However, when she keeps losing a game she will *feel* stupid. And My City would go out of its way to make that feeling permanent because all 21 games are unfortunately played in order to collect points that determine an ultimate winner in a kind of overarching grand tournament. You etch these points in granite at the end of each game, permanently defacing your player board in order to register that you are not equal - someone is better. 

""But author"", I hear you write, ""aren't all games tournaments of some kind? Does your partner not just dislike competition?"" Absolutely not. The problem that arose was this; the games, even the once she won, were pointless because she felt she was too far behind. I had a winning streak at the beginning, which gave me an early lead. The game has some catch-up mechanisms built in so that people who have lost one game will have an easier time winning subsequent games. Later games have more opportunities to score these end game points though, so what would happen is that my partner would win overall games, but I would still score *some* points meaning that I would stay in the lead and get a bonus that would make subsequent games easier for me.

This all came to a head at around envelope six, where the game was absolutely soured for both of us. We completed the series at my partner's request, because she felt that it would be unfair of her to not complete the game just because she was behind, but there was no real tension anymore. The thing that was meant to tie the games together (this overarching competition) actually completely tore our game apart.

The big difference between disconnected games where you win some or lose some, is of course that the end result doesn't really matter in that a loss once has no lasting effect on another and does provide that learning experience that we all like to talk about. My City's setup doesn't have that. The tallying of points means that losses pile up, the way points are scored later on means that there is no real catch-up mechanism for players who fall behind other than a vaguely gesturing at ""git gud"", and the game shifting around with envelopes and new rules means that players who do lose don't get to learn from mistakes because there's always new mistakes to make.

As I said though, we did complete the game and I was kind of glad to get rid of it. We played it as a two player game though, which meant that the game still had half of its components unused. So, after having taken a bit of time to reset the envelopes and hide our components beneath the insert, I gave our copy away to another couple who love playing games together. And you know what; they ran into the exact same problem. My understanding is that they've stopped playing though, not wanting to taint the time they spend together with frustration and Sisyphean tasks that are completed just for completion sake rather than inherent joy. Maybe we should have done that too.

So what did that leave us with? It left us with a game that started out exactly like its promise; a light-hearted and accessible puzzly game with legacy elements that will keep the game fresh each time you play. The way the game executed that promise, however, caused a snowballing in which the rich would get richer and the people who fell behind early had no real chance to catch up - so why keep playing if you have no real chance to win? And this conclusion actually really makes me sad, because the gameplay in the box is really solid and inviting, and the envelopes themselves are exciting and full of promise. If only the team had taken equal care to cultivate a connective tissue that was equally inviting and kind.",My City: from blossoming sprawl to ghost town (a post-campaign review),1,self.boardgames,yohycr,DarkJjay,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/yohycr/my_city_from_blossoming_sprawl_to_ghost_town_a/,1667814021

"Let's say I have three separate clusters of buildings with power 4 (2xTrading station), 3 (PI), 1 (mine). In general I can not create federation of them, since it would be 8 power and 7 power is possible by excluding one cluster (mine), right?

But what if the mine is in-between 4-power cluster and PI and is surrounded by my federations already, so there is no way to connect 4-power cluster with PI with out touching mine with my satellites (independently of how many satellites I have). Can I create the federation in such a situation? Or I just need to give up on that idea at all?

"I have a game group where we rotate who's house we play at so we can play each others games (easier than hauling them to other people's house). Recently it occurred to me that some people almost exclusively have card games*, while others have board games*. 

What I mean is, one guy almost exclusively has games that mainly feature cards with possibly some tokens. Games like Jump Drive, Dominion, Paper Tales, Villagers, 7 Wonders, etc. Another guy mainly has what I will call board games - games with a central board and maybe player boards: Great Western Trail, Pax Pamir, The Search for Planet X, Beyond the Sun, Brass, etc.

It struck me that these guys could have purchased any games, but each of them chose to primarily purchase games in one of two formats. Have you ever noticed that some people seem to prefer card games over board games or vice versa? Does this describe you?

"So I got Inis about a month ago and have played it about 7 times now. I recently did my first 2player game and to be honest I wasn't confident that it was going to be as fun. But I think it was actually my favourite, I was so wrong. 

The clans moving around the map aspect is a little less explosive and fun but not less strategic imo. This is simply because it's hard for me to work out the motivations and intentions of everyone in a 3 or 4 player game so I basically just watch it unfold and react accordingly. In a 2 player game I felt like I could somewhat predict what my opponent was intending to do on the board and vice versa. 

But the real magic was in the card drafting. Picking a card is so difficult because you are not only shaping your own hand but also that of your opponent. It feels so bad to give them anything at all, but you know you have to give them something, so what do you give? Festival and let them block your attack? Conquest and let them attack you? New alliance and let them swap one of your clans for one of theirs? It feels so good trying to work out what cards you actually need for yourself and what cards you must not let your opponent take so as to stop them from winning. 

Overall I'm a huge fan and I'm glad everyone raved about it so much, it definitely lives up to the hype for me. 


P.S. One issue I still have with the game is that most of my games tend to end suddenly. I thought with the Pretender token system that it would be easy to extend the game and block the winner from winning, but what has happened in 90% of games is that the winning player will take a pretender token right at the end of the season after everyone has used their cards and no one was able to see it coming beforehand since the victory conditions are a lot to think about in 3\4 player games. I think with experience we will be able to stop more victories and extend the game more but so far the endings have been quite anticlimactic.",2 player Inis is insanely good!?,1,self.boardgames,yo865o,nolanb13,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/yo865o/2_player_inis_is_insanely_good/,1667782376
"Hi peeps, I'm looking to identify a board game from my childhood that I recently remembered some details of but have been unable to identify the game. Unfortunately the details I do remember are fairly vague, but I'm hoping the collective mind of this sub might be able to help.

What I remember/know of it:
- It was available in the early 2000s, may have been released significantly earlier, but I'm fairly sure I played it before I was at secondary school in 2003
- It had a theme of temple raiding (a la Indiana Jones or Tomb Raider) where the aim was to get in steal a gem (and/or maybe coins?) and get back out.
- I believe there was an idol of some import (but I'm not not certain about this)
- It had a physical board (not card game only or tile laying etc...)
- It was not a simple roll and move game like monopoly or snakes and ladders, I don't believe there were dice at all, but I could be wrong.

"I have introduced my housemates M, P and L to Catan recently and much to my delight I have found that they love it, they now suggest we play it rather than me suggesting it all of the time. But there’s a downside…


M has learnt very quickly, whereas L and P have not. This leads to two of us (myself and M) dominating every game whereas the other two are getting bored and frustrated,


When I first started out I restricted myself, putting down both of my first settlements last or choosing options purposefully to make myself lose but with M excelling I feel I now need to compete - how can I catch P and L up? 


Are there any restrictive things I can do for myself and M without offending the others?


How do you deal with skill differences in games like Catan?


Issues I have noticed:
*P simultaneously has a lot of cards yet has nothing to do with them. Can’t build, can’t get dev cards. How?!
*L is just unsure of what to do
*P struggles to build roads or settlements early (due to the first issue) and he always ends up being boxed in. Mid / late game he always ends having literally no where he can build settlements…

"Fellow social deduction and board game friends, my friends and I are excited to share SUPER DARK with you. At the heart of our game is the concept of DARK MONEY - campaign contributions made in secret which divorce the origin of the financial backing of a candidate or a proposition from the messaging. While the practice is legal, it creates conditions for foul play in which very rich people and corporations can influence politics through opaque financing of campaigns.

We think we've created a deception game that can be enjoyable for people who are not usually into social deduction games. There are a lot of meaningful decisions around resource management that add to the depth of decision making in the game. You can learn more about our Kickstarter campaign (including pricing, timeline, as well as visuals and testimonials) HERE. I want to take the chance to talk about the design decisions that we had to make over the last 3 years.

**Origins of SUPER DARK**

Super Dark was originally created as a classroom project to teach people about SOMETHING. Three of us were in that design class, and created the very first version of SUPER DARK as a way to teach people about Dark Money. That prototype had the beginnings of a social deduction game, so a friend of a friend connected the OG trio with me and my best friend. The OG trio brought a lot of know-how on the design side, and at that point in time my best friend and I had over 5 years of running social deception clubs everywhere we lived. The two of us live and breathe social deduction games to this day, and SUPER DARK incorporates everything we have learned about what makes for a great deception game.

In 2022, over 100 people have joined us to physically playtest the game at various events. You can find pictures from those playtests HERE, and heavily used throughout the Kickstarter. If you live in the SF Bay area, you will be able to join us TODAY at Dogpatch games to play our game and help us celebrate the launch: https://www.dogpatch.games/events1/super-dark-launch-nov-5 There are still a few spots left, and you will get to hang out with the 3 of us who live in California.

Core principles

The core principles guiding the design of SUPER DARK as a social deduction game were as follows:

The game should be playable with 5-8 people.

There should be no player elimination.

Even if your team affiliation has been revealed as a member of the ""bad team"", you should still be able to have meaningful impact on the game.

Limited round timers are a part of the balance and enjoyment for the ""bad team"".

The game should not need a host.

The first two principles are pretty self-explanatory. There are better games to play with 9+ players (all the possible variants of Mafia and Werewolf, as well as BotC), and all of them incorporate player elimination to meaningfully drive the game to a conclusion in a timely manner.

The third principle we feel is pretty unique to SUPER DARK. Quite often in a game of Avalon, Secret Hitler or Mafia, the best move you can make will also make your participation until the end of the game low-fun. You get the PLAY OF THE GAME moment and then you don't get to play anymore.

In SUPER DARK, just like in real life, if you are known to be bad, you actually get to keep getting money from the bank, and you get to keep playing to your team's win condition. Sure, nobody will listen to your plan about funding a candidate, but you get to keep playing the game. We have gotten overwhelmingly positive feedback on the mechanics that allow this to happen.

SUPER DARK only works as a timed game. Of course, you are free to have a house rule that extends or abolishes timers, but in our experience that would make the game unbalanced. Given enough time, the Citizens will certainly figure out the most efficient and low-risk way to accomplish their goals. I've personally gotten stuck playing 3 hour games of Avalon where a person decides to hold the game hostage until they can bludgeon everyone to accept their point of view. Not giving the Citizen team (the good team in our game) a lot of time to talk has made the game more enjoyable for our Super PAC players (the bad team) to actually play. The addition of somewhat strict timers was well-received by our playtesters, especially those with a previously negative experiences playing deception games.

Finally, similar to Avalon and Secret Hitler, you do not need a host/moderator to facilitate the game. We use a mechanism similar to the mission voting in Avalon through which the Super PACs can communicate the outcome of each funded candidate.

Core mechanics

We developed the core mechanics largely by mimicking the theme set all the way back in 2019. The gameplay happens in discrete ""funding rounds"" - the group discusses who should be donating to which candidate, after which players simultaneously reveal their donations. Progress towards ""earning a point"" is a lot more gradual than it is in Avalon or Secret Hitler. To corrupt a candidate, the Super PACs may need to donate to that candidate multiple turns in a row, all in the public's eye.

All actions are ultimately public. I could write an entire post about the progression of the design of the board as a bookkeeping mechanism, and how we are adapting that for a PnP version (that will also be available to backers as early as December). But the main point here is, you get to see what everyone else has done and the entire state of the game right in front of you at all times. Your core objective as a Citizen is to allow the flow of information between the Citizens while not falling behind on points; your core objective as a Super PAC is to destroy that flow of information (by polluting the money pool), and to score points in the confusion of the Citizens.

There are certainly still plenty of familiar moments from other deception games - 50/50 decisions of the type ""it is Player A or Player B"" - but SUPER DARK plays a lot more like a team game, where you usually have to figure out what combination of donations led to the outcome you saw, and thus actually solve for the identities of more than one person at a time.

Another core mechanic that made its way all the way from 2019 is the concept of DARK MONEY. Dark Money serve two functions - they temporarily take away agency from the Citizens who draw them (you have to play your Dark Money immediately if you are a Citizen, and the Dark Money always counts towards the corruption threshold of a candidate), and they give opportunities for meaningful decisions to the Super PAC players. Super PACs can either stash away their Dark Money for later, and donate two cards at once in a later round if they want to OR they can start a long-term play by putting a bit of Dark Money on a candidate under the guise of having no choice.

TL;DR aka Conclusion

Game design is a never-ending process, but we're proud of our contribution to the social deduction space and think we've made something fresh and unique. The incremental progress facilitated by the money mechanic, the ability to make powerplays as a Super PAC and still be able to play after that, and the Dark Money mechanic that adds plausible deniability to the moves a Super PAC might make - all of these create a rich strategy space where hiding your identity becomes secondary to scoring enough points to win the game.

I played this game quite a lot at university; my friend who owned it thought it was a classic, and more recent chat with friends and stuff I've seen online seems to agree.

"This was written in a phone so I am very sorry for any awkward formatting.

So, I discovered I love board games four years ago. I love discovering new games and new mechanics, I love watching no rolls barred and “de quem é a vez” to see how different people play different games and I love acquiring games and hosting. Buying wine or making coffee and hot chocolate, getting some variety of snacks and inviting people to play with me. 

I’ve been inviting my different friend groups (separately) for about those 4 years and I’ve come to a sad conclusion, they don’t like board games that much. I get it that it’s not for everyone and I still have a lot of shared hobbies with them so we’ll still hang out but that leaves me with a problem: how can I find people to play board games with me?

Is there any site, any direction? Has anyone ever been in this position? What did you do? Any tips? I live in a medium size city in Brasil where we have only one board game bar, but there’s not a lot of opening for a stranger to join a family or friends table so it’s not a great option. Finding people through the internet is an option, it’s not the most fantastic idea (inviting strangers to your flat being a 20 year old female) but I would try it. 

Just for a little bit of context I’m not some weirdo who wants a specific type of person, I’m open to anyone who would like to play some party coop games and some heavier strategy or dagger on your back sort of games.

I understand that they cost more to make, often 5 to 10 x the production cost, so that's definitely the biggest factor for why publishers don't include them.

But what about for promos? Or games that you would definitely sleeve?

They contain lovely artwork that you don’t need to do extra work to make them pop - no need to paint or put stickers on them. With minis, when you’re too lazy to paint, it’s just a see of grey blobs on your board. As for the euro meeple/cube perspective, it’s because I like nice artworks and it helps with the immersion.

"I have always loved board games, especially grand strategy war games. When I was younger I would play Risk, Stratego, Battleship, Diplomacy, Catan, and my favourite was Axis and allies. So I was thinking about how to turn risk into a better game as I always hated the fact that in the end it came down to how lucky you were so I thought that if you combined Stratego with Risk it would turn it into a much better game, and then I got thinking. I thought that sea routes could be controlled by the players and that to contest them each player would have to play a full game of battleship for each army that is on there and for every land battle the players would have to play a full game of stratego for each army. There wouldn’t be any trading in cards or continental bonuses to limit the amount of armies to make the game shorter and the players would play from 7-10 rounds. You could have teams of 6 with each player taking one army in an attack and all decisions must be unanimous and each person is assigned  person on the other team that they are the diplomat for so that they can communicate with other teams to try and win. The team with the most territories by the end of the game are the winners. I hope that this doesn’t get taken down, I’m new to this subreddit and didn’t know what it was all about so I decided to share my idea to make your next game of risk at lot more fun and strategic.

"So I've played this card game a few years ago. I dont remember all the rules but I do remember the general idea. In the extra noted section is where I get stuck explaining the game two someone

Play:
At the beginning each player was given a card and then they had to bet with their finger how many times they were gonna win in the round (I know confusing). Then in the next round you were going the players would receive two cards, then three and so on until five. After receiving five cards, players will receive one card less each round until they only get one. That last card card is the last round; instead of looking at the card players would put it on their forehead so everyone else can see it and the betting continues. At the end of the game players will count the points they've accumulated, most points wins.

Betting and points:
During play you would put down a card thats stronger than your opponents if you wanna win or weaker if you wanna lose. Lets say you get three cards and during the betting phase you raise one finger. That means you wanna win once and lose twice. If what you bet was true at the end of the round you receive 10 points + 1point (for winning once). If you win or lose more or less than what your bet was you receive -10 points (you still get +1 point for each win). The strenght of the cards is pretty much standard, two is the weakest and ace is the strongest. However hearts trumps any other suit, so a three of hearts beats a queen of diamonds. 

Extra notes: 
There was also a pile of cards in the middle and the top card would get drawn at the beginning of a round. You had to play cards of that suit at the beginning of the turn if you any, and that suit became the second strongest suit for the round. But like I said I dont really remember the entire game, just some more information in case some knows what game im talking about

The teach was more focused on specific gotcha rules instead of what your goal is.

So this turned into a lot of ""I didn't know you could do that"" from everyone else.

On top of this, the guy said he had about 20 solo rounds prior to bringing it.

Now, I don't have an issue with worker placement games like I used to, but I would like to at least research what strategies are out there ahead of time if we are playing one.

My friend who showed up for the first time I felt really bad. I was hoping to show him multiple different genres and probably get 3 different games played until the venue closed.

So, here's the thing. Cards Against Humanity was fun the first time I played it, but it's been boring ever since. Same with similar games based off Apples to Apples. These games don't really give any room for creative thinking. You're stuck with a small set of options, and most of the time is spent waiting around for someone else to do something. When it is finally your turn to participate, you have nothing interesting to choose from. It's also somehow mostly the same 1-2 people who win all the cards, no matter how many players there are - and it goes up to 20! So boring.

Then there are the bluffing games my gf owns like One Night Werewolf, Avalon, and Coup. I don't like any of these games! I only like lighter bluffing games like Love Letter.

"So most people seem to agree that the Galactic Events and Rift Cannon mini expansions are a bit overpowered and introduce more randomness. 
I'm wondering if any of you have any thoughts for these home rules I came up with to help mitigate this. 

1) Galactic Events: At setup, instead of shuffling the GE tiles into their respective T3/2 hex piles, stack them in their own pile and shuffle. Your long-range sensors have picked up unknown space anomolies. Whenever you explore these sectors, you flip the bottom tile (so you don't know if it is that sole t2 one or not) of the GE stack instead of from the t3/2 stacks. These locations are placed more or less equidistant between players. In the image linked of a 4 player setup, the GEs will be flipped when exploring the areas marked with the blue circles. http://imgur.com/a/Fm16ley
Also, maybe adding you need to roll +1 higher to keep supernova stable than original rules since it's super easy to keep it from exploding. 

2) Rift Cannon: The side of the die that does 3 damage to enemy and 1 to yourself, instead does 2 damage to an enemy and 1 to yourself.  This makes it slightly weaker (less OP) as well as slightly less random. OR if your Rift cannon backfires, it also does not fire during the next engagement round this battle. OR if your Rift cannon does damage to your ship, it does a damage to an additional one of your ships if possible.  

Just trying to keep it simple with less randomness that can cause unbalance.
Thoughts?

We had a scientist, a medic, and a dispatcher: we all had good ideas that were implemented which allowed us to win the game without much margin at the end (in terms of the number of player cards, everything else was under control). 

There were two real high points: 

* An epidemic hit Manila. There were few other disease cubes in the area, so we used the card to remove Manila from the game: we decided it was too much work to get down there to treat diseases so the people would have to suffer. As payback for our hubris, there was a chain reaction outbreak from LA, spreading yellow disease cubes into Asia; and

"Been a BGG user for a long time. I have completed well over 100 trades, bought and sold games there, but I came to a big realization this week: I'm done acquiring games in the hopes that they will hit the table.

I have 300+ games. I'm 65 years old, retired, living with a wife and an adult son. All of us were moderate to enthusiastic gamers in the past, but my wife is starting to exhibit memory problems, and her patience for learning new games fell off *a lot* during the last five years. She only wants to play things that she knows very well, and even then, some things that she has played many times she can no longer recall the rules to (which pretty much destroys the fun she could have playing).

My local play groups fractured during COVID. The newer one, which had a bunch of 30-something guys and me as the old geezer, kept meeting in one guy's basement right through the pandemic. When I expressed severe doubts on that being a good idea, I was quietly dropped from the group. Now it's been 2.5 years since I played with them, and I think they have just forgotten my existence.

I'm beginning to realize, with quite a bit of sorrow, that my retirement is unlikely to involve weekly game sessions anywhere. And in a small number of years, I'm going to have to downsize this house with its luxury of storage space (one room's walls is nothing but built-in bookshelves! It's 50% board games!) for a condo. Today I have turned the corner from acquiring 5-10 games a year to dumping 3-5 a month. I have at least 50 games on the shelf that I've never played, and realistically never will: they are not something either of my housemate-family members would play unless I threatened them with a stick. (I bought or traded for them in anticipation of introducing them to one of my local play groups.)

"I've been going to a social night at my local gaming cafe for about a year now and it's become the highlight of my week, a core group of about 20 people that are all decent and the odd new person that are welcomed and usually have a great time.

But recently, maybe about a month ago, this guy has been coming who clearly has some social issues, unless its a game that he has brought and is teaching people he spends much of the time making anxious noises and huffs and puffs through the game and creates an awkward atmosphere. This I can mostly ignore but at the most recent session we played a medium weight game that I was teaching and I had realised that half way through an hour long game I had missed a rule that could have made a few points difference, I apologised and for the other 2 people playing it wasn't a problem but he had a mini meltdown, saying that he couldn't believe I would bring a game that I wasn't totally familiar with and from this point on he was gonna taking a passing turn cos he couldn't see the point in continuing, after some persuading we finished the game and he ended up coming second anyway.

I've talked to the guy who runs the cafe and I'm really not interested in playing anything with him again, I'm almost certain he might have some mental or social difficulties but he makes every game totally unjoyable and borderline puts me and other people playing on edge. Has anyone else had this kind of experience? Maybe I'm being the asshole and need to just deal with it.","How to deal with a guy who ruins a gaming night, although it's not necessarily his fault",1,self.boardgames,ylykbk,Boggins316,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/ylykbk/how_to_deal_with_a_guy_who_ruins_a_gaming_night/,1667567220

These incorporate some errata that were not yet included in the 1st Edition according to BGG. I cannot find that errata for the life of me though, can anyone point me towards it or knows what the differences between the 1st and later editions of the original game are?

I'm also curious what people think about the original Game vs the proper Second Edition. It's essentially the same game with a different dungeon system and character cards, right?

"I am subscribed to the newsletter for the HOMM board game, which looked and sounded awesome - until yesterday, when they happily announced to change the unit-cards to minis. Thanks, I hate it.

Why? Imo, it has many downsides:
- More expensive
- Less content (minis need more space than cards, are more expensive to manufacture)
- They are ugly (yes, I just said it. I like great art on cards way more than minis)
- The information about the mini has to be, naturally, somewhere else, like, you guessed it, a reference card. Why not cut out the middle-mini.

I see that there are people who love having minis or like to paint them. But imho that trend spilling over from table top wargames into boardgames is awful.

Also the same for cthulhu wars. WHY have those huge ass ""minis"" (or hugeis?) instead of smaller ones, more variety, lower price. I understand it's a selling point, but yeah, just wanted to vent on that cthulhu wars part a bit since it's apparently a very good game.",Am I the only one who H A T E S the trend for Minis?,1,self.boardgames,ylqpt7,Troll-or-D,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/ylqpt7/am_i_the_only_one_who_h_a_t_e_s_the_trend_for/,1667542808

"I am going to back the season 3 of Cthulhu Death May Die and the availability of Unspeakable Box is quite interesting. Most CMON fan boys scream getting this item without saying about the quality of the box's contents. They just mentioned 18 investigators + 2 monsters box = huge value and replayabilty. But i rarely seen people mention if the contents are actually good or they are just after thoughts, half baked stuff. 

For those who's experience with the game, please give me an honest opinion of should newcomers grab this box. I think the below reasons are not good enough to warrant the purchase:

\- It's so cheap, only $120, it was sold $500 on Ebay. Go get it now! -- &gt; Just because it used to sell for $500, doesn't mean it's cheap... With $120, we can actually pledge another campaign like Oathsworn or Tainted Grail.

\- 18 investigators + 2 monsters = OMG! -- &gt; Please let me know are these well balanced? CMON is famous of adding tons of FOMO to their Kickstarter. If you know Zombicide, they have tons of OP exclusive characters (for example Xuxa) that completely throw game balances to the bin.

"Hi, I recently got TM. It is my 2nd board game (1st one being Pandemic bought in 2017). Board games are expensive to import in our country, so there isn't much of a community here to play board games, so we may not be familiar with everything boardgamers are supposed to know.

Anyways, we read the rule book for TM, watched a few videos. There are still a few clarifications we need. We probably got most of them right, but since English is our 2nd language, we just wanted to make sure that we have the rules right (we are avoiding Corporate Era cards for now).

|**Sl. No**|**Clarification for:**|**What I/we understand**|
--:|:--|:--|
|1|Rule: What if all except 1 player passes?|A, B &amp;amp; C are playing. A passes first, so B &amp;amp; C continue turns. C then passes, which allows B to perform as many turns (and actions) as he wishes before he passes|
|2|Meaning of 'in play'|Cards played and face up in front of you. VP from cards in your hand but not played do not count.|
|3|Corporations with 1st action: cost?|Tharsis Republic gets 40 MCr plus a city on 1st action (i.e. they don't pay 25 MCr for the city on first action)|
|4|Card: Adaptation Technology|Each case means you choose + or -2 steps every time you play a card with global parameter requirements|
|5|Jovian tag: effect?|You need to play a card with 1/Jupiter VP effect; once you play that, all cards you have (in play or in your hand not played) with Jovian tag will give you 1VP|
|6|Earth tag|Does this have any effect on the game other than for Teractor player?|
|7|Card: place microbe on ANOTHER card|ANOTHER card is basically another card where microbes can be placed, not just any card|
|8|Card: Search for life|Once you get a science resource, you get 3VP. You don't get any more VP or 3 VP per science resource|
|9|Card: Zeppelin|ON MARS explicitly means not Phobos or Ganymede|
|10|Card: Ecological Zone|You get two animal cubes when you play the card, and for any card with both plant and animal tags, you get two animal cubes|
|11|Card: Lava Flows|You must place the tile in one of the four places mentioned, else the card is not playable|

Another question my friend told me to ask (even though I am 99.99% sure he got it wrong). He had Symbiotic Fungus and Regolith Eaters. What he did was use his first action with SF to add a microbe to RE (which had one microbe already). He then proceeded to increase O2 with the same action. I caught him when he was going to perform another action (which I thought was a third one, but he thought it was his second). What I understood after discussing with him was that he thought SF action triggered RE action automatically, also RE action to add a microbe to the card also automatically triggers the O2 increase action if possible. I told him all these are separate actions, but he was unconvinced and asked to me check the internet forums.
