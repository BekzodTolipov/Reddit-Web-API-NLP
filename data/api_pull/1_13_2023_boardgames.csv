"I had a awesome thought while playing Mage Knight, and it was to combind Catan. The way I thought of combinding it is via the mage knights to protect the houses, roads, and cities you build as waves of enimies come towards you, when you make a development card, the knights are men you have hired, or you can choose a deed card. I though it would be awesome and wanted to know if anyone has tried this before.",Is there a possible way combinding Catan and Mage Knight Ultimate?,1,self.boardgames,10b6ovy,The-surfing-banana,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/10b6ovy/is_there_a_possible_way_combinding_catan_and_mage/,1673646747

1. What are the tokens for? They have stuff like pilots on them and stuff, they're about the same size as a dime. I usually don't use them, also the instructions have zero info about them.

"This is my first time doing this but I thought I'd share some thoughts on the 210 new to me games this year. Instead of giving them a score, I decided to rank them and group them by how much I liked or disliked them. 

**Top ten**

**1	. American Bookshop** This was the year of trick takers for me and American Bookshop was the best one I played by a long shot. 
It has two twist to distinguish it from other similar games. First, if the card you play brings the sum of card over a certain threshold, you win the trick no matter what suit you played. Second, every cards you've won is worth -1 point unless you've won the most cards of that suit. At which point they are worth +1 point. It's simple and tricky at the same time but.i.love the game for that.

**2.	 Un DÃ­a en el Mercado (Fresh Fish)** Trick takers were a big part of my year but so was Friedmann Friese. Fresh Fish is a game of blind auctions and push-your-luck tile placement. You try and secure spot while other players try to lodge you out without joeparding their own positions. It's mean and tight but every one I've shown it to has loved it. Shame it's out of print but you order spanish copies for reasonable prices and the game is language independent.

**3. Ultimate Railroads** Far and away the best euro game I've played this year. The base.gane is great and the expansion all had a little something without feeling necessary. It has the best implementation of worker placement I've seen in a game. The spots are few and the competition is fierce while giving you some flexibility. Compared to most worker placement games that have come out recently, it's refreshing. 

**4.	Factory Funner** I never would have thought I'd love this game as much as I did. It's a head down puzzle game with little to no player interaction but the puzzle is part of the game is unrivalled. This was without a doubt my biggest surprise this year.

**5. Yokai Septet** Another trick taking game with a twist. This is the only team trick taking game I've played but I love the idea and the gameplay of it so much that it deserves this spot. I'm excited to try more games that play in the same space. 

**6.	Sakura Arms (level99 Edition)** I'm a huge fan of card battlers and Sakura arms is the best version of it I've played. The gameplay is smooth and rewarding. The deck building aspect is streamlined but it still offers a lot of meaningful choices. This is the kind of game that gets stuck in your head after every play. You think back on all your turns and you try to think about what could've been done differently. It's a masterwork and it's a shame barely anyone talks about it. 

**7. So Clover!** Best party game I've ever played. It works with everyone and the simultaneous play makes it feel much shorter compared to other word games of the same genre. I haven't had one player who didn't love it. 

**8. 	City of the Big Shoulders** It's daunting, complex and cut-throat economic euro game. What's not to love! Surprisingly, or not so much given how tenuous the teach is, I've only played the game with 2 players but I still adore it. It mixes worker placement and economic decisions seemlessly and it allows for a variaty of strategies. I'm extremely looking forward to playing it with more players and I recommend anyone who enjoys economic euro games to give it a try.  

**9. Wayfarers of the South Tigris** Given that **Paladins of the west kingdom** is my second favorite game of all time, it's no surprise that I was excited for Wayfarers. Fortunately, it didn't disappoint. This one is much more open and akin to **Viscounts** but just like other Garphill games, it offers a nice twist of worker placement. It makes the workers a finite ressource that player must manage between them which adds a fun tempo aspect to the game. I'm also a big fan of the dice manipulation aspect which I've always found a bit lacking in other euros with dice. 

**10.	Automobile** One of the oldest games I've played this year and also probably the ulgiest game I've played this year (treefrof/warfrog edition). This is a limited actions (16 decision point) economic Martin Wallace game. You vie for control of car markets while trying to respect the demands. It's another cut-throat economic game but it's so different from anything I've played before. 

**Absolutely great games that didn't make the top ten.**

"A friend of mine was trying to find this game but canât remember the name.  Hereâs what she said:

âSay itâs your turn to play, you roll the dice and fall in the movies category (other categories were activities, things, etc.). You pick a card from the deck and have to choose among the 4-5 movies listed the one you feel relates to you the most. All other players do the same and vote individually which movie they feel relates to you the most. Only after everyone has voted in a movie for you, all choices are revealed and the players who get more votes for their movie pick, win the round.â

"Just picked up this highly anticipated game and got a game in after wanting it since launch.

I went in with my expectations in check because I know some people are down about a few things with this game. Iâm glad I went in that way because my expectations were blown out of the water! Yes, there is a lot of iconography. Yes, they should have made it more obvious which spots on the board you can move your units on. Other than that - wow! 

We played with 3 people and of the 13 turns, it took us about 3 turns until we were fully bought in. A lot of the iconography is relevant all over the game so once you learn a few basics itâs pretty intuitive. We had a really tight game that ended up having to be broken through tie breakers. 

The artwork is beautiful, itâs a real brain burner with how much stuff you can do and we all had an absolute blast.

They say game 1 is usually rough and then it gets better and better but if thatâs the âtoughâ game then I canât WAIT to get this back to the table.

"Hey gang,

I'm working on an engineering work project overseas and I'm looking for suggestions for boardgames (or games in general) to play on weekend nights for a group where we don't share an equal understanding of a single language.

My group consists of about 50% who's first language is english from different countries (USA, South Africa, Canada). The other 50% speak a primary language other than English (Spanish, Russian, some others), but everyone speaks English as a second or third language to various levels of proficiency. Our team also consists of professional translators, but I'd rather they spend more time playing and less time translating for others.

We're looking for boardgames that can accommodate everyone, and we also don't want to split teams as english vs non-english speakers. Are there top-of-mind suggestions for such a group? 

Project groupsize varies between 4 and 15 depending on the week, and not everyone is looking to play, so any suggestion would be useful.

"Just wondering what games do this best, in your experience. I have not seen this question phrased this way. For example, I think Kingdom Death: Monster does this really well. You have a whole grid for your gear and it is almost like a mini puzzle. If you get a powerful piece of gear you may want to completely change up what you are doing to utilize that gear. You may find a piece of gear and wonder how it could be useful... and sure enough someone online figured out how to make it really powerful. 

So what games have loot that feels very consequential and exciting? 

I love games that do this. Middara and Kingdom Death: Monster both do this pretty well I think. Massive Darkness 2 to some extent as well. Personally, I would say Gloomhaven does not.

"Hey gang,

So we've been sleeving hardcore all possible cards from our board games collection, and you know what happens then: cards don't end up fitting anymore in the plastic boxes that originally came with the game, and I don't want to use rubber bands to keep the cards together since it might damage the sleeves or card edges. However, the sleeved cards tend to slide around everywhere in the boxes.

Sometimes, there's even other pieces that are not properly stored and tend to fly around everywhere.

"I recently bought Mage Knight ultimate and I do not regret it. I highly recomend this board game. The combat is the best I have ever seen, the art on the map, characters, cards, and box is imaculate, and you get all the exspansions out there. This is a amazing game that has almost hit all the spots needed for a perfect game.

Pros - The games are not very long unless you play with 3-4 people, you will never play the same game as there are many many tiles that all lock into each other (like catan) The attacking and fighting mechanics are a bit complicated but are absoulutly worth it, as being victorious after defeating 3 enemies on a low level powering you up to get a new high score feels amazing. You can only use cards to attack, but it isn't easy, but it is a fun little puzzle with many outcomes with the endless amount of enemies. It took me about half a day to learn the so called HARD rules. Mage Knight also has a amazing solo player mode which is so much fun being able to play when ever you want to and not having to rely on someone to play with, I havn't found any die hard board gaming buddies yet.

Cons -  It takes a lot of space up with one person, and more and more with more players. I had next to no room on a 5ft lifetime table playing by my self. There are little castle peices that have a little spinning part and not all of them spin properly, I have to pull them appart to see how many enimies I fight which is annoying. All the cards except 3 types all have the same back. So if you drop them for some reason or mix them up accidently, it wil be a absoulute pain to sort out. The cards when you get them out of the box were mixed up for me, I'm not sure if that was a 1 in a thousand, but it took 30min to sort out. It is also just a attacking game, not really a relaxing game to play with friends you want to catch up with.

To sum it all up, it beats catan, axis and allies, spirit island (unless you play with younger people) and defiently beats monopolyð I highly recomend this game if you love a point based game with awesome attacking/video game feeling, and you need a table unless your back is amazing. 8/10",My review on Mage Knight Ultimate,1,self.boardgames,10aodei,The-surfing-banana,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/10aodei/my_review_on_mage_knight_ultimate/,1673594704

"Hi all,

I'm trying to remember a game in my grandparents' game closet I was obsessed with in the early 90s. Foggy details I recall:  
\- It had a rectangular, deep red box with a simple design (the name of the game only?)  
\- The player tokens were small metal planes on stands  
\- The board was a world map overlaid with a square grid  
\- You rolled dice to move a number of squares each turn (you chose which direction)  
\- There were commodity cards you earned or purchased (e.g. bananas, spices) and possibly transported in exchange for money  
\- My grandparents' closet contained games dating back to the 60s, but from the design elements I recall I suspect this was from the late 70s or 80s

Forgive my memory, I suspect it's tainted by the fact I goofed around most of the time without learning the rules until my aunt explained them to me one day.

Thanks!","Game ID: Commercial Airline, Commodity Trading/Transport, World Map, Square Grid, Red Box, 70s/80s",1,self.boardgames,10ahwfy,EarlessBanana,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/10ahwfy/game_id_commercial_airline_commodity/,1673575126
"During the pandemic, I was reading a book on game design that had exercises in it. One exercise was to create a board game based on a movie that wasn't action or adventure-oriented to see if you could still capture the spirit of the film. 

Working with a friend, we ended up making a fictional movie tie-in board game for Being John Malkovich. It's definitely not the most polished board game ever made but we had a lot of fun working it.

We finally finished it last May and I was thinking about it again today, so I thought I might share it with all the fine people on r/boardgames.

"2022 was another fantastic year of discovering new games and diving deeper into this wonderful hobby we share. I continued to play lots of old favourites while also expanding my repertoire with 38 new games in person and 30 new games on Board Game Arena. In this post Iâll be listing and rating the games I played for the first time this year. Iâll also be discussing my top 10 favourites of the bunch. And giving a brief overview of the 2022 releases I played. Lastly, Iâll share some reflections on the year. You were all so supportive of [my similar post at this time last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/rwwiwk/my_2021_in_board_games_60_new_games_played_and_my/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). I hope youâll enjoy this one as well!

# New to me games of 2022 

These are games that I played for the first time this year. Iâve split this in to two sections - games I played in person and games I played only online on Board Game Arena. A handful of games I first played this year are not pictured. I take these pictures every year with u/tomjackilarious to showcase the new games we played together, so the most notable omissions from the picture are games that he had previously played but I had not. Those games are still listed below.  
 

I play the majority of my games at two players with my husband. I also prefer light to medium weight games and games that play quickly. So for the most part those are the sorts of games youâll see on this list.

The games are listed in chronological order of when I first played them - to the best of my recollection. Iâve also included my current rating out of ten for all the games I tried this year. For a bit of a frame of reference on my ratings, any game rated seven or higher is a game I enjoy and would recommend. Sixes are mediocre, and anything under that was not something I liked. Nine or higher is something really special, an absolute favourite. The ratings are based on my own enjoyment of each game, so there are certainly great games that I havenât rated highly. As you might see, there were lots of games I loved this year but also some that were not for me.

**Played on BGA**

You might notice that the games in this section are rated on average a bit lower than the games I listed above. Iâm willing to try a much wider spectrum of games on BGA, whereas most of the games I play in person are typically games I buy because I think Iâll like them. So there are fewer hits among these games. There were also a couple of games I loved on BGA so I bought them, and those appear on the list above.

# My top 10 new to me games of 2022

These were the best of the best. The games I canât help but gush about. The ones that keep me up at night thinking about them. Two of these games even broke in to my top 10 games of all time! A notable thing with my top 10 of the year is the clear Reiner Knizia trend. Heâs my favourite designer and four of his games appear on this yearâs list. Also of note, half of my list is two player only games. And six of my top ten are small box games.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img 93lj3lxl9pba1...*

Iâm listing the games in top down order as they appear in the photo, not in order of preference. I havenât ranked my top 10. That holds true for most of the list, with the exception ofâ¦

**Tigris &amp; Euphrates** \- my game of the year is Tigris &amp; Euphrates. Every bit of praise youâve ever heard about this game is warranted. Itâs a masterpiece. Thank you to our BGA overlords for adding this to the platform this year. Iâve been wanting to try this for a few years, as it is often said to be Kniziaâs best, and he is my favourite designer. The basic concept is so simple - on most turns you simply place two tiles on your turn. But the reactions those tiles can cause - wars, revolts, the building of new monuments, etc. is where the meat of the game resides. Itâs a game that follows the typical Knizia design principle of simple rules, and then it doesnât. There are some mildly finicky things to know about how each of the different colours work, the differences between wars and revolts, what tiles are cleared from the board, etc. Things that even after 36 games I still occasionally have to clarify. This isnât a short game, and yet it still maintains a characteristic of games I love most - every move feels like it is of deep importance to the overall game. Missed opportunities are hard to come back from. Placing tiles in less than ideal ways has repercussions throughout the rest of the game. And yet this game isnât stagnant. Things can get taken off the board as quickly as they were first placed, creating new opportunities for straggling players. Players are incentivized to be as big an annoyance to one another as possible. It is incredibly interactive, wildly strategic and yet also very unpredictable. Thereâs a considerable element of luck in terms of your randomly drawn hand of tiles having a massive effect on your possibilities and strength in wars and revolts. But while that does feel limiting, it never feels like a knock against the game. Itâs just part of the beautiful flow of it all. As you play the game you get the sense of seeing kingdoms rise and fall, tides turning towards new civilizations, new sought after territories. My one and only major gripe with this game is that itâs out of print. I can not for the life of me find a copy in good condition that is selling for a reasonable price. And that is nagging at me, because as completely wonderful as this game is to play on Board Game Arena, I think when it hits my table it will bring a whole other level of immersion. As I understand it, though, we shouldnât have much longer to wait before this game is on store shelves again.

**Winter** \- Maybe the biggest surprise of the year! I wasnât prepared for how impressed I would be by this game. It comes in the unassuming package of a tiny card game. But Iâd say itâs right up there among my favourite abstract strategy games. The game is played over the course of two rounds. I wonât give a full rules overview but basically in the first round you are playing cards out to a joint display. Each card features four snowflakes, one in each corner, and those snowflakes are of two different shades of blue, one for each player. When a group of four snowflakes of your colour is played you can place one of your tokens in the centre. In the second round that beautiful display of snowflakes gets torn to shreds. You must either move or remove a card from the display or remove a token. This can cause the display to splinter - in which case only the section with the most tokens remains in play. Eventually one player will have no tokens remaining on the display, and the player left standing wins. It is so thinky, strategic, brutal and delightful. I first played this game in December so it is still quite new, I have far further depths to explore in it. But I am beyond thrilled and excited by what Iâve seen so far. And all that stuffed into a $12 (CAD) card game in one of the tiniest boxes of my collection. Fans of Hey, Thatâs My Fish! will doubtless appreciate this one.

**CafÃ©** \- This game ingeniously combines card placement with engine building. Iâve played quite a few engine builders at this point, and this may be my favourite one yet. Your goal is to make an engine that lets your produce lots of coffee. Itâs not a theme that inspires me, Iâm not a coffee person. But for me the appeal of this game is the gameplay, full stop. You draft cards that feature things like beans to harvest, drying beans, coffee roasters and cafÃ©s, which you have to place and use as optimally as you can. The way the card placement works is challenging to say the least. Each card is a grid of 6, and when you play a card it has to overlap at least two spaces of cards already in your tableau. So youâre forced to sacrifice features that were helpful to you in order to install new ones. As you play out the game you will also have cubes representing coffee beans on top of spaces in your tableau, and in order to build on top of those spaces you have to discard those beans. And the beans are your points at the end of the game. Adjacency matters in the game but trying to get your cards lined up just right hardly ever works perfectly. You also want a balance - having three coffee roasters isnât helpful if you only have the ability to dry a third of those beans first. The game also features âKnizia scoring.â There are four colours of coffee beans youâll be accumulating, but you only score for the beans you have the least of. If I had to describe this game in one word it would be: tense. The tension is palpable when I play this game. But if, like me, youâre the kind of gamer that likes facing an uphill battle to build something worth the effort, then youâll know that that tension is part of the fun. Building a functioning engine in a game that imposes so many barriers to that is incredibly rewarding. And again, we have a game that feels much bigger than its box size and price tag, which doesnât hurt!

**Nanga Parbat** \- I was drawn to this game for purely superficial reasons. I wanted a game with yak meeples and had decided the game Yak wasnât for me. Iâd also just given away Red Panda, a rather silly childrenâs game which I had bought purely because I love red pandas. (Yes, I am too easily swayed by cute animals in board games, we all have our weak spots!) Low and behold I see a picture of Nanga Parbat, which has not only yak meeples and red panda meeples but plentiful other adorable animeeples, gorgeous box art and beautiful game boards. I was sold before I even knew what the gameplay involved. But now, the substance of the game is what impresses me most. This is the most typically âmeâ game I played this year - it plays quickly, features an interesting open drafting mechanism, is two player specific, is a perfect information game, features no in game text, and, yes, the animeeples too. But this game isnât only great for me on paper, the gameplay leads to moments that are exciting, at times brutal, sneaky and clever. You draft animeeples off of the main board which is a mountain featuring 6 sections, each section housing 6 spots for animals. Whenever you take an animal, you put one of your meeples in its place. The animals each have a special power that you can activate once. To score points you trade in either sets of the same animal or sets of different animals, or you can build camps to replace collections of adjacent meeples of your colour. But each time you choose to score points, you must place one of your five scoring cubes on the board to do it, so you are limited to scoring for five things over the course of the game. And once a scoring cube is placed on a spot (e.g. there is one spot for trading in 5 animeeples of the same type) that spot is taken and neither player can score that amount for the rest of the game. This leads to a game that is all about timing and making tough compromises. Itâs a beautiful game, inside and out. (P.S. this absolute gem of a game is on Board Game Arena for free and you should try it! Iâll play it with you if you want!)

**Battle Line: Medieval** \- At some point a number of years ago I heard this game compared to one of my most played games, Lost Cities. And the sentiment was that it was by the same designer and was so similar that if you had one in your collection, you donât need the other. Boy, am I ever glad I decided to ignore that tidbit. This game is a) extremely different to Lost Cities and b) absolutely brilliant. It took me a couple of plays of Battle Line to realize the breadth of possibilities in this quick card game. But once that clicked, I couldnât stop thinking about the game. It was one of those instances where Iâd catch myself daydreaming about it, thinking about strategies to try the next time I played. And what has surprised me is that months later, I still feel that way after each time I play. In this two player card game you play numeric cards from various suits out to your side of 9 battle fields. Your goal is to win either 3 adjacent battle fields or 5 battle fields total before your opponent in order to win the game. The card play has so many subtleties. To win a battle field you have to play 3 cards to your side that are either a better strength/formation than the 3 already played by your opponent, or can be proven to be unbeatable by your opponent if they donât already have three cards down. The formations are similar to poker hands. Three cards in numerical order of the same suit is the strongest possible formation, then any three of the same number, then any three of the same colour, then cards of any colour in numerical order, and lastly cards played at random. To add some spice, the game also has a deck of cards with special powers that let you do things like steal a card from your opponentâs side of a battle field or score a battle field based on the sum of the cards rather than the formations. The fact you can win a battle field based on proving that your three cards are stronger than anything your opponent can conjure there keeps you constantly eyeing which cards have been played and what options your opponent has - emphasizing the interaction and competition of the game. This could feel a little mathy to players who donât enjoy that type of thing. Luckily, I very much enjoy that type of thing and this game is a new favourite.

**Quarto** \- In some ways, Quarto is like many other abstract games of its kind. You place pieces out on a grid, and try to win by placing a line of four matching pieces. But in Quarto, the players donât have their own player pieces, they are drawn from a central pool. Also, each piece has four distinct characteristics: it is either short or tall, either dark or light, either round or square, and either has a hole or doesnât. To win, you need to be the one to place and claim the fourth piece in a line that all match based on any one of those characteristics. Also, and most excitingly, your opponent chooses which piece you get to place on your turn. The result is a game where you donât only agonize over the best placement for the piece you are placing on your turn, but also over which piece to give your opponent that is less beneficial to them on their turn. Itâs a game where I often catch myself thinking multiple turns ahead, yet the whole game can look drastically different after a new piece is placed. It is so easy to miss things, to not see a win coming. Or at least, thatâs easy at this stage of my time with this game, I am definitely nowhere approaching good at this one yet. All of the twists Quarto offers on the abstract genre make it a more exciting game than most, but it also hasnât deviated so much that it feels any less classic or timeless. If youâre a fan of abstracts, donât let this one escape your notice. Shelf space is at a premium at my house these days but they sell a mini version of Quarto, which is what I have, itâs even easier to rationalize getting a copy!

**Royal Visit** \- This was the first new game I played this year, and as with last yearâs standout The King is Dead, it started the year very strong. Of all of the new games I played this year, Royal Visit is without a doubt the one I have played the most so far. Itâs the kind of game that I can hardly ever play just once in a sitting. Itâs common for my husband and I to play 3 games before packing it up - and sometimes even 3 isnât enough. There have been few games that have entered my collection and taken over my gaming time by storm to this extent. Royal Visit is a one for the ages. In this two player card game, you play cards to try to lure the King and his court to visit your duchy and castle. The (beautiful cloth) board is a straight path with 17 sections. The two sections closest to either player is their castle, and you win if you manage to get the king into your castle. But alongside the path, there is another track that houses a crown. And you can also win by having the crown move along its track until it reaches your castle. Apart from the King, the court is made up by two guards which must always be on either side of the king, a sneaky jester and powerful wizard. Each character is represented by a different suit of cards that move them along the path. Part of what I find quite fun about the card play in this game is that on your turn you can only play cards from one suit, but you can play as many of them as youâd like. You always have a hand of 8 cards, but this incentivizes you to grow a stash of cards of a suit and play them all out in a big dramatic turn. Those kinds of turns can completely swing the game towards a player. Itâs a game of tug of war, dragging characters towards you and then prying them back away from your opponent when they try to steal them. But this game is far from a tedious back and forth - the interplay between the placement rules for the characters, the way the cards of each suit work and the special powers of the jester and wizard lead to a wonderfully interactive, surprisingly thinky and often exciting tactical game. Perhaps what I like most about this game is that each time I play I encounter situations that feel different from anything Iâve seen before, which is saying something over 100 plays in to a simple card game. Reiner Knizia is master of many things but I donât think you can understate how great his two player card games are. This one is now my favourite of them.

**Whirling Witchcraft** \- Hereâs my one line pitch for Whirling Witchraft: Itâs like if you put Century: Spice Road and The Quacks of Quedlinburg in a blender and somehow ended up with a game thatâs better than both. Welcome to about as non-dry a cube pusher as cube pushers get. Ever wanted to push your cubes into your opponentsâ cauldrons and cause their workbenches to overflow? No? Well, now you do! Whirling Witchcraft is so silly and chaotic in nature that youâd be forgiven for not noticing how strategic it is. Also, Whirling Witchcraft is so brain burning and strategic youâd be forgiven for not noticing how silly it is. But in my experience you notice it all - the chaos keeps the strategy from feeling overly heavy and the strategy keeps the silliness from feeling frivolous. Itâs the best of all worlds and itâs a treasure of a game. Iâd fail at trying to explain the rules in any sort of understandable way. But in a very basic overview - each player has a workbench to hold potion ingredients. At the start of each round you draft recipe cards that you play out in front of you in an engine building tableau to let you transform potion ingredients into other potion ingredients. Once youâve played your new recipe cards, you can use ingredients from your workbench to put them to good use. You then fill an adorable 3D cauldron of a neighbouring player with potion ingredients that they transfer to their workbench. Which is great for them in theory, as long as they can use those ingredients. Because excess ingredients that donât fit on your workbench get pushed to an opponentâs witchâs circle and once a player has 5 ingredients in their witchâs circle, they win. Thereâs lots of other stuff going on with each player having a witch with special abilities, arcana powers popping up that let you have one time effects, some recipe cards being able to be played in whatever orientation you choose, etc. But inherently what you have here is an engine building push your luck game that is unbelievably fun. 

**Terra Mystica** \- Terra Mystica is so wide in scope that I hardly know where to begin. Thankfully, this game ranks 24th on BGG and by any other metric is among the most popular hobby board games of all time. So I donât feel the same urge to hype it up and explain it as I did with most of the others on this list. Terra Mystica is a game that has been one of my husbandâs favourites for nearly a decade, but I have shied away from because of its complexity. I believe this now ranks as the most complex game Iâve played, and that feels accurate to me. But one day this year I just said f\*\*\* it, and asked my husband to teach it to me. The game has so much that appeals to me. Itâs a perfect information euro game. Itâs a fantasy themed game with evocative artwork. It involves a shared board and network building. Iâve felt the draw of this game for years and dismissed it as something I wouldnât enjoy because it is heavier than my tastes tend to line up. And, well, it is. I donât usually want this many rules, this long a play time, this many details to remember, or this much stuff going on. But Iâll make an exception for this one. Because far from feeling like some sprawling game of disconnected parts, everything here feels significant and interconnected. Itâs also exactly the fantasy game I was looking for, one that feels true to the theme to me, with fun player factions whose powers reflect their fantasy race perfectly. I am catastrophically bad at this game. Iâm not accustomed to balancing this many priorities at once. But Iâm proud to say that after 16 plays I finally got a win last time! Weâll see if that ever happens again, I somewhat doubt it. But Iâll enjoy every loss immensely. 

**Babylonia** \- I learned this over the Christmas holidays and have only had the chance to play it once. I donât normally put games on my top 10 of the year based on early first impressions. Other great games I played in late December like The Red Cathedral, Concordia and The Wolves might have cracked this top 10 list had I played them a few more times each. But with Babylonia, itâs undeniable. Not only is this one of my top 10 games of the year, I believe itâs one of my top 10 favourite games of all time. Maybe that sounds like a preteen impetuously declaring their first real crush to be âthe one.â But letâs just say, Iâve had other loves before and Iâm not as easily swayed as all that. I think, my friends, this is the one. While impossible to compare at this stage to Knizia games Iâve played many times over, I think this might become the king of all Knizia games to me. I have been thinking about this constantly since I played it. Iâve read and watched countless reviews of the game. Iâve pulled the game box out just to stare at it for a while. After my first play, I hugged the damn thing. To me, it is perfect, and my wasted heart will love it until the last bit of colour has faded from the board. As it is so very new to me, Iâm not going to attempt to capture itâs essence except to say it is an abstract euro where you place out tiles on to a map that allow you to score in a multitude of ways, largely to do with area majority and networks. Some other time after Iâve played this about 20 more times (give me a month or two), I may well write a post just about Babylonia. But for now, you can just know that I yearn to hear the little click of a wooden tile being played out on the gorgeous game board and the joyous feeling of scoring a well connected network near a city. Pure bliss.

 

# My thoughts on the 2022 releases I played

Based on the dates listed on Board Game Geek, I have played six releases from 2022 so far. Here Iâve put them in roughly descending order of preference and talked a bit about my impressions of each game.

&amp;#x200B;

[The 2022 releases I have played so far. Sea, Salt &amp; Paper and Caper: Europe are not pictured as I only played them on BGA.](https://preview.redd.it/b7d3f0epdpba1.jpg?width=2772&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=9398df45b6c54b78544576eecc5d2d7b9a07d24c)

1. **Winter** \- my number one 2022 release perhaps shouldnât count as a 2022 release, as it was previously released in 2016. But, as Iâm just going off of the game entries on BGG, this one counts. Iâve extolled Winterâs virtues in my top 10 list above. But in quick summary, this is a beautiful, brutal, clever and quick abstract strategy game that is strong enough to stand up against the titans of the genre while being small enough to fit in a tiny little card box.  
 

2. **The Wolves** \- a shiny new area majority game. The Wolves caught my attention with its stunning visuals before much had been announced about the game. But donât let the appearance keep you from delving deeper, this game has a lot going on. There are a lot of connected pieces here - how your wolf packs move around the board, what triggers the round scoring, how you need to flip tiles of certain territory types in order to take actions, etc. The main flaw with my copy is errors in the rulebook and on the player aid, which made it a bit a clunky start for us. But following print runs of the game will have an updated rulebook which is already available to download on BGG, and helps smooth out the confusion that held back an otherwise great game.  
 

3. **Wizards of the Grimoire** \- a duelling card game that I actually like! I wasnât sure it could be done. But Wizards of the Grimoire is unique. It is streamlined and yet exciting. It plays quickly, feels very well balanced while also giving players turns when they can feel extremely powerful. The way cards are drafted and played is quite smart, with mana cards covering cards in your tableau that you must clear out of the way before you can cast the card spells. You can tell that the cards are made to play off other cards in the deck well. Itâs a fantastic quick two player card game, with a fun theme, engaging artwork and a building sense of excitement and tension as the game end nears. Super fun.  
 

4. **Flamecraft** \- if I were to move to the land of a board game, it would doubtless be the magical town depicted in Flamecraft. This game of tiny dragon artisans helping out their human counterparts in their shops is too cute for words. The dragon cards and shops all have punny names. The town is full of diverse inhabitants, a place where everyone looks to be accepted and content. Itâs wonderful. So itâs natural that the gameplay feels just as easy going and friendly. I think the gameplay fits the theme, but itâs also not the style of gameplay I usually gravitate to. Thereâs nothing brutal here, no real blocking of worker placement spots, very little tension. As a result, I donât see this getting played frequently at my house. But the charming, relaxing nature of the game fills a fun niche for a day when we want to play but not feel too competitive. It also seems like a great fit for introducing friends and family to worker placement games. The game ramps up, new shops with worker placement spots are added as the game progresses. So it would be great for easing people in.  
 

5. **Sea, Salt &amp; Paper** \- this is a very preliminary impression based on a single play on BGA, which isnât much to go off. But it seems like a perfectly fine, cute and fun card game. But thereâs nothing there that excites me too much after one play. I do like the art style that looks like folded paper, and some of the powers in the game seemed clever. I'd have to play it more to see what I really think.  
 

6. **Caper: Europe** \- I bounced off of this game hard. And I wasnât expecting that, because I am a huge fan of two player specific games and this one has been widely praised and recommended. This is a case of not every game being for every person. Caper: Europe fell very flat for me. I thought it was boring, unexciting and charmless. That doesnât seem to be the prevailing opinion, but my husband didnât care for it either.   
   
 

# Reflections on my gaming this past year 

This was a big year for me in gaming. It introduced new ways to game and new understandings about my wants as a gamer. Here are some reflections on all of that. 

**Board Game Arena as a new part of my gaming habits.**

  
 Prior to this year, I hadnât tried Board Game Arena. I was under the impression that I would not like playing board games online. And then my husband told me that I could play Patchwork on there whenever I wanted, and that changed everything. I did play Patchwork whenever I wanted - 432 times to be exact. I also found wonderful folks on this subreddit to play games with. And my husband and I started playing turn based games together throughout our days. And then I even invited some of my real life friends to join us. Itâs been a treat to have board games always on the go, that I can play at my own pace. Itâs also been a treat to get to play some of my favourite games in real time with complete strangers and see how I hold up. A major benefit is also getting to try games that I wouldnât get to try otherwise. Board Game Arena has even helped build up my confidence a bit. At home, my husband is the game wiz and wins the grand majority of our games. But on BGA, I hold up pretty well against other players. Playing games on BGA also opens up fun opportunities to play with friends who live out of town over video chat, and Iâm looking forward to taking advantage of that this year. All in all, I played nearly 1000 games on BGA in 2022. Iâm looking forward to seeing what my BGA plays look like after another year, and trying new games and new things.

**Playing with friends and family.**

  
 In last yearâs post I mentioned that I had the opportunity to play my first in person game with folks other than my husband in years. I was ecstatic about having that one experience to celebrate. Well, this year that grew. Iâve continued to make progress in the social anxiety that has been the major barrier to gaming with others in person for many years now. And in the past couple of months I have hosted four in-person game sessions. Thatâs a very big deal for me and Iâm excited about what that means for the future. Playing games in person with just my husband is still my favourite way to play. But playing games with friends and family is so joyous, and such a fun addition to my gaming life.

**Finding time for the bigger and longer games.**

  
 In the past couple of years, I have acquired some heavier games and longer games than used to occupy my collection. But the bulk of my time playing is still spent on lighter and quicker games. Iâm okay with that, in fact, itâs my preference. And it also fits my lifestyle better, my disabilities often make it so that I am not able to play the longer, heavier fare or games that take up more table space. But I would like to carve out more time to play games that take a bit longer, occupy more table space and have a bit more rules overhead. This year, largely because of some unexpected events in my personal life, my gaming time overall was cut way down from the previous year. And as a result, any time I had when I was up for playing a bigger game, I played a new game. Because those times were so few and far between and I had new games I wanted to experience. But new games arenât the only thing I want to experience - I want to play games like Architects of the West Kingdom dozens of times. Iâm a player that likes to play her favourite games repeatedly for years. Iâve learned from 2022 that I have to be very intentional about that when it comes to certain games, because no matter how much I want to play them, they arenât the ones Iâm going to reach for ninety nine percent of the time. So in 2023, I intend to make sure that I am intentional about setting up times to play some of the games in my collection that get less attention.  
 

**Who was I kidding? I love buying new games!** 

  
 In last yearâs post I said I was ready to stop growing my collection. And I really believed it too! Well, this year saw me acquire about half the amount of games I did last year. But thatâs still a hefty dose of new games added to the collection. What Iâve realized is that while itâs true that I like to play games many times over, I also very much enjoy playing new games. And not only playing them, I enjoy learning about them, researching them, finding them, and all of that. So going in to 2023 Iâm not going to say that Iâm ready to stop buying games as part of the hobby. As it turns out, that part of the hobby is here to stay. But I will say that Iâm hopeful that this year I can add even fewer games to my collection than I did last year. I hope I can be more selective, choosing to buy only the games that excite me most. And I hope that I wonât add so many new games to my collection that it leaves many of my favourites unplayed.  
 

# Bonus - u/tomjackilariousâs top 10 games of the year 

Tom won't have the time to do a write up like this one to share with the sub. So I thought I'd share his top 10 games of 2022.

*Starred (\*) games appear on both of our top 10 lists. There is lots of overlap this year. We have 7 games in common on our top 10 lists. And Terra Mystica only missed Tom's list since he has played it before.*  
 

**Tigris &amp; Euphrates** \*  
 

**Scout**  
 

**Winter** \*  
 

**Battle Line: Medieval** \*  
 

**Arboretum**

"Another Kickstarter doom and gloom story here. Probably sick of those, but figured itâs worth giving people the heads up.

Iâve been in the hobby for about 5 years but new to joining campaigns, so definitely naÃ¯vetÃ© playing a part here.

I was super excited for Dune: War For Arrakis. Love the IP and the game looks fantastic. Missed the first campaign but was able to secure a late pledge, $160 Carryall edition, no problem. Filled out their survey in October. Done.

Have an extremely busy last few months of the year with moving house and various personal matters. Realise that I havenât heard a peep from CMON in months. Log in to Backerkit to update my address - and discover that thereâs a survey Iâve missed that was due in late December. No problem, Iâll just reach out to them to update my info I figure. Have done this with other campaigns when thereâs been an issue and had no trouble.

No. They tell me they have sent me countless emails reminding me to fill out a survey to confirm pledge and pay for shipping - despite the fact Iâve already paid $160 and the game doesnât ship until October - and policy states my pledge is now void. I provide proof that I did not receive said emails (but did receive communication from CMON advertising other products). They tell me that is âbetween you and your internet providerâ and continue copying and pasting their original email.

I repeatedly state I donât want to take this out on support staff doing their job and ask to talk to someone who can help me. That doesnât exist apparently. 

I ask for an explanation as to why they canât help me. Maybe theyâve had to lock production or something (seems weird so far out). No explanation other than itâs my fault.

My only options? To leave funds with CMON for a future campaign (why would I do that after this?) or get a refund minus 17.5 percent because Iâve missed the cut off for full refunds - despite this being a refund I neither want nor requested. 

Totally get this is what you sign up for when you use Kickstarter, and I guess this is all my fault. It just stuns me that an established publisher working with a huge commercial property like Dune, needs to behave this way. Using Kickstarter to finance games instead of a standard business model and then using it as an excuse to get around basic customer service doesnât seem in the spirit of the platform to me.

"A problem I've encountered with most heavy games I've played (not that many, tbh), is that they expect you to know every rule/mechanic from the first play. On the contrary, videogames have no need for you to read anything as the game itself teaches you how to play it. I myself like to reproduce steps while reading instructions to know how to play, as I learn better that way.

Recently, in Nemesis Lockdown, there's a mechanic that make so that aside from your own secret objective, there's a secret general condition, that you need to accomplish in order to survive. One such conditions is having enough knowledge, but without having played before or memorizing every item/room it's not possible to know which ways you have to increase knowledge (I'm pretty sure the rules mention the archive, but it's a one-use room).

Anyway, I know some others have ways to ease into the game, like Western Legends has a section that has you remove some cards from the events if it's your first play. Or I've heard that Jaws of the Lion is basically a tutorial from Gloomhaven. I want to play Mage Knight solo but I'm a bit overwhelmed with how heavy it seems to be and I fear it won't have said easing mechanisms.

"So, I never played Risk growing up but I played a lot of chess and Fire Emblem. As a younger introverted adult, I'd buy board games but never had anyone to play them with, so I tended to sell them when I needed money.

I keep seeing them termed as Area Control and Dudes on a Map games, and being well ranked on lists of such games.

But one thing I've noticed is that people tend to praise Eric Lang's CMON trilogy of Dudes on a Map games and they praise Inis/Cyclades/Kemet but I've never seen them contrasted in a discussion or gotten an idea of how they stack up in comparison.

I like Blood Rage as a casual party game and Ankh as a fiddlier duel of a dance. I've been told that Rising Sun is a more epic version of these two games but I was wondering if Kemet, Cyclades or Inis would be a reasonable next thing to try, or if they feel remotely similar.

"Two decades ago I helped create the Open Gaming License which helped save Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Today that license is at risk of being changed by Hasbro and Wizards of the Coast. I am hoping that a coordinated response by the community might make them reconsider their plans.

Please join me in signing this petition on change.org. The more people who sign, the more visible this effort will become and the more likely we will have an impact on the decisions being made by Hasbro.

I believe time is of the essence. An announcement of their plans may happen today, Thursday the 10th of January. If you are inclined, please sign the petition now.

Thank you for your support!

"Dear Readers, two years ago I released my first album âEvengardâ.

Evengard  was my little (so to speak) imaginary world, surrounded by characters,  places and fantastic creatures, some of which accompanied me throughout  my childhood, while others were created recently. Many of the song  titles are a bit bizarre, I'll grant you, but they mean a lot to me.  Evengard is not just a music album, but all my stories and knowledge  that I have lived and am still living have been ""contextualized"" in this  world. Since I am not a writer, but a composer, I naturally described,  with the tools I currently possess, the rough idea of ââwhat I have  always imagined.

Among other  things, I wanted to inform you of the fact that this album can be an  excellent tool to be used in other contexts as well: for example for  your Dungeons and Dragons session or for the creation of a certain  character. Indeed the album offers different themes for each type of  situation, for a type of character or the description of a soundscape.

Thank you all for your attention, Marco Cutini.

"Hi,

I need the help of some boardgame sleuths.

In the 90's there was a version of Clue that I remember playing and I can't remember the name. It had a 3D board with platforms. I believe the game is called Clue: The Great Museum Caper but I'm not 100% sure after looking at some images.

We're there any other clue games from the early 90's that had a raised board?

"Maybe a slightly weird request.

I recently bought a pack of small card sleeves intending to sleeve the cards in 7 Wonders Duel. However, when I got home it turned out that the sleeves I got are literally 1-2mm too small to fit the cards (I can manage to insert them, but they end up slightly bent and it's just not a comfortable fit at all). So now I have 100 empty tiny card sleeves with no cards to put into them. 

Do you know of any (good) games that use tiny cards that would also benefit from being sleeved?

"We did not claim that our technology will save lives, reverse climate change or defeat poverty, but 'just' that it will make new tabletop experiences possible. 

And doing so, we reached a very important milestone: the leading Austrian research and development fund will support our project, Tablescope, in 2023 and part of 2024. 

Tablescope focuses on developing computer vision technologies for tabletop games and exploring how players and game designers can sensibly use such technologies. This is a crucial milestone for us as we can continue working at full capacity on what we love and believe will be helpful to others.

Sure, the grant supports the development of a technological tool. But the motive is board games, and that motive was finally sufficient. This success came after a series of rejections in which, between the lines, we read that tabletop gaming was less important than other topics. However, board games found their way to the top this time, and this is an achievement we should all be proud of.","The Austrian government supported our board game-related project, and this is something we should all be proud of as a community",1,self.boardgames,10a4cg8,LeonardoAlese,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/10a4cg8/the_austrian_government_supported_our_board/,1673542285
"I am very interested in the Pandemic Legacy Series and was hoping for some input from the community before I plunge in.  I have a couple questions.  My wife and I play boardgames quite often and our 8 year old twins are ramping up to play with us as well.  We have played most of the modern community must plays, with particular enjoyment of games like Suburbia, Terra Mystica, Dominion, Terraforming Mars, etc.  The kids have played (and done well) playing Planet Unkown and Flamecraft with us.  My wife and I have played base Pandemic in the past, but she isn't a fan of cooperative games; she prefers competition.  (but I'm hoping the legacy series may intice).  


I have a few questions:

1. What order do you recommend playing the games?  S0, S1, S2? Or S1, S2, S0?
2. Can 8 year olds handle Pandemic Legacy, considering they are pretty good with modern game mechanics and I don't care about ""winning"" versus having fun with the family.  In other words, I think, based on my experience with base Pandemic, that my kids will be able to understand the mechanics and goals of base Pandemic.  Do the legacy games complicate that basic framework too much for younger games to understand?
3. If it winds up just being me and the wife, would you recommend playing as two characters (one for each of us), or as four characters (two for each of us)?",Advice Regarding the Pandemic Legacy Series,1,self.boardgames,10a3ws3,knuckles53,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/10a3ws3/advice_regarding_the_pandemic_legacy_series/,1673541236

"This might be a little too comprehensive, but [here is the collection](https://imgur.com/gallery/10InXY2).  I am happy to answer any questions you might have.

For some backstory, I have bipolar depression and tend to hyper-fixate on hobbies until I lose all enthusiasm and move on to something else eventually. About a year ago, I found myself bored and looking for a new hobby to peak my interest.  My partner and I thought it would be fun to get scrabble, and I also had played Pandemic years back and picked that up as well.  After that, we played a bunch of both (I have learned to hate scrabble because my partner is a prodigy or something) and found it was a way to spend time together that we really enjoyed.  Fast forward about a month later, I see some designer board games on reddit, which made me realize there was a deeper world to explore.

Over the course of the last year, I have absolutely poured myself into board gaming as a hobby.  This is the first hobby I have obsessed about this long without losing interest entirely, which is huge for me.  So instead of spending disposable money eating out, buying videogames, etc, I started to collect.  It was slow starting at first, but once I got the itch there was no stopping it.  I have spent hours on bgg, r/boardgames, youtube, etc.  At one point it became obvious I was being pretty annoying about the whole thing.   At this point, I have worked out where my harmony is I think.

I have been lucky to have a Partner that wanted to support my interests, and has been kind enough to play a lot of games with me, and to encourage me every step of the way.  That said, it got to a point where I felt more like I was just collecting the games for production value and not playing a lot of them.  The problem with that is that getting and learning a new game has become one of the few things I can really enjoy.  So to justify my rapid collecting, I started doing grunt work to find other people  in my area to form a consistent gaming group.  It was tough at first, but I have been making good progress since about August.  At this point, I play about 4-5 games a week with my partner and 1-3 with the group I have been building. I have not played through my collection completely, but that is okay because I will get to them eventually. Also, a big part of what is keeping my interest is the discovery and intrigue of a new game. 

I am so thankful to all of you that have unknowingly guided me on this journey so far. I feel like I finally have a static focus, and I can tell I am overall more happy than I was a year ago.  I love seeing the enthusiasm you all have, the varying opinions that have helped me figure out what games I like, your strange tendency to treat each other with respect when you disagree.  I am looking forward to the future, and especially looking forward to playing some of these games I probably should not have bought lol.

  

**My Opinions, for what they are worth:**  



**Top Five Most Played**:  
1. Wingspan - This is the first more complicated game we got into, it was intimidating at first but has become one of our favorite games.  My partner took to it because it feels less competitive and it's satisfying to see your engine purr as intended.  
2. Parks - Another game we really enjoy, definitely feels more competitive but still really laid back.  She used to beat me all the time, but I realized she takes things faster than she needs too and I have started to gain an advantage.  Production value is through the roof, and everything feels really balanced.  
3. Dice Throne - BATTLE YATZEE. Honestly, this game is just too much fun. It was another hit early on, easy to learn difficultish to master.  Lots of content to explore if you are able to get it, and just a really unique experience, who doesn't love chucking the bones.  
4. Cascadia - Easy to set up, simple enough rules, surprisingly difficult.  For a calm little game, things can start to feel pretty intense when you need that goddamn salmon.  Things get especially tense when your partner is aware of that, does not need one, but takes it anyway just to throw the token back in the bag.  I am still working on my plan of revenge, but my day will come.  
5. Above and Below - Sleeper banger, honestly.  I do not see this mentioned much, but we are just absolutely enamored with Red Raven at this point.  The mechanics feel really intuitive, and the cave delving/storytelling aspect keeps us super engaged.  I was gifted Near and Far as well as Sleeping Gods for Christmas, and I am really excited to explore those as well.  

**Top 5 Personal Favorite:**  
1. Everdell - ""Now wait, we have to see how much I beat you by *exactly.*"" What a cute, unassuming, fun little way to end an entire relationship.  Despite the simple and cutesy feel, Everdell has lived up to all the hype I have seen.  Every game has felt unique and challenging, but the game I kept pulling one combo after the other was honestly better than Tacos.  I love Tacos.  Unfortunately my partner finds it a bit overwhelming and it has been difficult to get to the table.  
2. Dice Throne - See above  
3. Cascadia - See above  
4. Above and Below - see above  
5. Pandemic: Legacy Season 1 - Pandemic is one of my favorite games, and I really love seeing how the game changes as you go.  We don't get this to the table nearly as much as I would like, but it is always a treat when we get to play.  

**Top 5 ""Meh"" Games (some I might purge):**  
1. Arkham Horror: LCG - I am really interested in Lovecraftian Mythos, so I was really eager to try this one.  After spending hours trying to memorize a confusing rulebook, I tried a playthrough which ended up being pretty confusing and I was pretty sure I played it incorrectly when I was done.  I could probably put in more work to learn it, but that sounds exhausting.  I wish I had someone in the room with me to hold my hands rules-wise, I think I would like the game much more. I should probably get rid of it, but I got it early on and it has been difficult to let go.   
2. King of Tokyo - Everything looks really cool, but the gameplay feels shallow and I feel like there are better options for a group.  
3. Dice Forge - The game is pretty good, but changing the die faces feels like a task for me which makes me unmotivated to bring it to the table.  
4. Sherlock Holmes: Jack the Ripper - Everyone absolutely raves about this game, and I am starting to think I must be playing it incorrectly.  I put in about an hour when I first got it, and everything felt on-rails.  As far as I can tell, the gameplay consists of going to a location, reading text to get a new location, go to that location, read tex to get a new location, spend 4 minutes trying to find said location, reading dext to get a new location, etc etc.  This one seems great as a story-telling medium, but it's not really for me.  

**Eager to Play:**  
1. Near and Far/Sleeping Gods - We liked Above and Below so much, and have heard good things about these two games so we are really excited to play them.  I would like to give Above and Below some more attention before I move on to those though, so they probably won't hit the table until later in the year.  
2. Scythe - I have heard great things, and played a few games on steam. It definitely is more complex than we are used to, but we're excited to bust it out after we make it through some other games.  
3. Brass: Birmingham - Also a highly recommended game. Everything definitely seems complex and tedious, but we love Roxley and and can't wait to try it. We have plans to break this one out on Sunday, so I have some legwork to do.  
4. Viticulture - I have discovered that worker placement games are some of my favorites, so this one has been on my radar for some time.  I just got it on a really good sale, I can't wait to make some dope-ass wine.  
5. Ark Nova - We actually got most of the way through a game for this, but we ran out of time and needed to clean off the table.  We are excited to break it out again, both of us really enjoyed learning all the mechanics and building our little Zoo.",My Year In Board Gaming or: The Dangers of Hyper-Fixation,1,self.boardgames,10a2nw0,Daniellamb,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/10a2nw0/my_year_in_board_gaming_or_the_dangers_of/,1673538178

We were placing the cards in those free spaces between cards that formed a field, maybe we were also able to swap them.

The problem is that the first edition of this game (which apparently is much better than the second one) is sold out from everywhere apart from amazon, where I can find it for about 159$. This is a problem, because I'll probably have to pay more than 200â¬ for it to be shipped to my country which is in europe. A solution I just found is buying it from a seller on ebay. It will be much cheaper that way, but I'm afraid I might get scammed or there might be pieces missing. Should I shoot my shot anyway and buy it from ebay?

"**Tucano** - Super simple drafting game that is extremely fun and easy to teach. The reason I wanted to make this list. Works great for 2 player which is rare for a drafting game.

**District Noir** - Fun two player game also known as Throne and the Grail. I donât think they should have rethemed this game as it actually hindered my understanding of the game.

**Vulture Culture** - Also known as âWhat the Heckâ. The stupid name (both of them) and bad marketing/theming has hurt what should be a well regarded classic. Itâs simple but exciting. Itâs like Just One mixed with For Sale. (How? Just try it in boardgamearena)

**Hugo** - Also known as âEscape from the Hidden Castleâ. Itâs just a dumb fun game. It isnât deep or anything though

**Next Station London** - âIt looks like Railroad Inkâ and it is a roll and write but plays quite different. I now prefer this over Railroad Ink. BGA does such a good job making it easy to play that our boardgame group had no idea how the scoring worked until we played it in person.

"I know this won't help everyone but I'm sure some can benefit from it, so here goes. Do you find games like dungeon crawlers to be a massive chore to set up and tear down? Does it prevent you from playing more? It certainly did for me. I now have a dedicated board game table and when I set up a big game I leave it there for a week or two and play just that.

During the pandemic, I had to set up a workstation on the table I typical use for gaming so I could work from home. While I could and did still play games on the dining room table, I couldnât leave a game up for long and it got to be a pain. So, I turned to my 2nd favorite hobby, 3D printing, and went to work.

Not long after I started the project, I maxed out my design/3D modeling skills, so I brought in some help. Now, almost two years and dozens of rolls of filament later, Iâd like to announceâ¦

[StageTop: The 3D Printed Gaming Table](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gutshotgames/stagetop-the-3d-printed-gaming-table)

StageTop is entirely 3D printed with no glue or screws and can be printed on any medium-sized (at least 210mm) FDM printer. The modular design can expand to fit most square or rectangular surfaces, but I've only tested up to 36â x 36â square and/or 32â x 48â rectangle :)

Different style rails, legs, play surfaces, and accessories can be added to the core components to create different ""tables"". The table in the picture is the StageTop Elite and features wood plank play tiles and two-piece rails. I printed the play tiles out of wood filament and the top of the rails out of TPU to have cushioned rails. 

The project exceeded my 1st day expectations on Kickstarter as I really didn't know how many others would be interested in 3D printing their own gaming table.  As a longtime member of this community, I wanted to share and see if others here may be interested.

Been thinking lately about keeping a tight and well curated collection. Imagine you can dedicate one cube of a Kallax to Eurogames. What is the definitive Eurogame 5 that you would pick.

2. **Agricola -** The definitive euro game ... full stop? Come at me Caverna'ers!! 
3. **Hansa Teutonica: Bix Box -** High interaction Euro, so fast, simple and crisp! 
4. **Brass Lancashire -** The economic one
5. **Concordia** \- The gateway/simple one

"Here is a PSA for the benefit of everyone here.  So Bezier Games, publisher of One Night Ultimate Werewolf, Suburbia, and Castles of Mad King Ludwig has been involved in some pretty scummy practices of late.  In spring 2021, they launched a kickstarter for a collectorâs edition of Castles of Mad King Ludwig, and fulfillment of the game was delayed by over half a year, which I guess is understandable given the circumstances.  However, what isnât forgivable is that before some people had even received their copies of the game, Bezier Games launched a kickstarter for an expansion to the game called âRenovations.â  A lot of people were incensed because they had assumed that a âcollectorâs editionâ was going to be a complete version of the game, and yet an expansion was being kickstarted before they had even received their copy of the game.

In the kickstarter of the Renovations expansion, most of the stretch goals were actually in the promotional pictures of the game from the beginning, and it was very obvious that the stretch goals werenât actually stretch goals at all - they had always been planned to be a part of the complete project regardless of how much funding they got.  They also refused to give shipping estimates, citing the price fluctuations in shipping last year.  Many people skipped the kickstarter because they were very unhappy about what had transgressed and because the expansion was supposed to come to retail anyways and Bezier Games had stated multiple times that there were no KS exclusives.

Well today, the pledge manager just dropped, and the shipping prices are close to or in some countries more than the price of the expansion itself, which is $30.  People were furious, and many people started getting refunds.  In an effort to stop the exodus, Bezier made an announcement about how the stand-alone expansion is not actually going to retail after all, and it does actually contain KS exclusives.    And if you want to late pledge now, knowing that there are in fact KS exclusives, it is now 33% more expensive to do so.  To me, this is the ultimate form of using FOMO to manipulate people, and itâs extremely disappointing to me that a company I previously considered to be above board would resort to such dishonest tactics.  Itâs obvious that Bezier Games plans to use kickstarter as their main sales model going forward, but I would think twice before backing their projects in the future.",Buyer Beware: Bezier Gamesâ Kickstarters,1,self.boardgames,1090aj6,Citizen_Watch,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1090aj6/buyer_beware_bezier_games_kickstarters/,1673427980

"So i've decided on selling off a game, Aquatica and its expansion, Cold Waters, because i realised the only reason i like it is for a component that's just single player solitaire. I absolutely adored the push-up card mechanic mixed with the mantas which could combo a LOT and there's little limit to what you can do, and the concept of a self-cannibalising engine as you move cards from your 'engine' to your scoring pile is fun.

Sure there's a bit of a race for points and the endgame between the players, and sure, there's interaction by drafting from two decks, but really, aside from that, there's like a single card that affects the other player. For a boardgame, i don't see why i'd want it to hit the table, and i absolutely am not a solo boardgamer, at that point i'd rather just pick up a single player videogame.

Has anyone tried using a spinning table top for games? I was thinking like a spinning puzzle table that you can find on Amazon and other sites. I thought it might help with games with a board where you have to play and read upside down if you are sitting on the wrong side of the table.

"I used to play a boardgame in the UK in the 90s and I would like to identify it but don't recall all the details.

From what I can remember, it was a cargo (or perhaps specifically oil) transportation game. There were containers which you placed on lorries and tankers and perhaps trains. I think there were also pylon pieces. I think the objective was just to move as much as possible from source to destination through the various modes of transport. It was a dark-coloured board &amp; box and was probably from the 80s or 70s.

So far my searches have come up blank. Any help figuring it out would be much appreciated.",Help identifying boardgame,1,self.boardgames,108ou25,draemon22,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/108ou25/help_identifying_boardgame/,1673393651

"Hey guys, my brother, my mother and I were playing this game, and we couldn't agree on what to do on phase phase 4 with New economy without any resource.


Because I have no resource to spend, do I skip the phase Consume and don't draw a card ?

Or do I still draw a card during phase 4 even if I don't do anything else after (by having no resource, no consumption power or both) ?


Sorry if it was already posted, I couldn't find the answer, many had a question about its other power, but not this one

"A bit late writing this one up, but right before the holidays we got a weekend meetup where we had up to 4 people at one point.

Tiny towns (at 2 and 4 players) - The first new game to us. We technically played this one 3 times, once at two players with master builder mode, and twice at 2 and 4 with the resource deck. Going in I thought the master builder mode would've been the more skilled version, but we just ended up with perfectly symmetrical building. After reading the rules twice and deciding we were doing nothing wrong, we tried the resource deck variant and it was a much better experience. At 4, each player had very very different towns, and its on the list of fun entry weight games. Let me know if anyone had success with master builder mode below.

Long Shot the Dice Game (at 2 and 3) - One of the most fun games in my collection at this point. I was worried after my play at 2 that there weren't truly meaningful decisions since it once again came down to the 3rd place horse deciding the winner, but in the 3 player game we had our first blowout, which in this case is a good thing. This one is being broken out every meetup. 

Trickerion (at 2) - So the past 3 meetups we took the rulebook out for this one, started trying to figure it out, and then gave up. Not today though. We figured it out and boy am I glad we did. We didn't play with the black market which seems to be a must for future plays to add replayability, but the action point selection mechanism is great, the choices of when to put on shows is smart, and it was a great game. Terrible rulebook though.

Blood Bowl Team Manager (at 2) - Our big purchase this year was the foul play expansion for Blood Bowl. We had the original and sudden death, but foul play is the must have expansion and we splurged as a group. A great addition to the game, and blood bowl team manager remains a favorite. 

My City (at 3) - We continued our My City game into chapter 3. I went on a bit of a losing streak this chapter and now there's a tie at the top with 3rd one point down. Not much else to say other than this is a fun, quick, tile placement game and I look forward to chapter 4. 

Townsfolk Tussle (at 4) - I'm starting to think the KD:M style games work best at 2. We won at 4, but the playtime and downtime stretched a bit long and eyes started to glaze over. On top of that, one fight had an early exit from one of the characters who got the reward of sitting there for 20+ minutes while everyone else played. At other times someone would have 3 turns of move towards the enemy, enemy runs to another character, repeat. It still worked at the end of the day, but 2 players might be my max in this style game.

Shadows over Camelot (at 3) - This is a real out of the dust, I don't think we played this in over 5 years. At 3 we played without a traitor, but with the Merlin expansion. Merlin was kind, letting us move pretty freely, a few early wins got us to 6 swords, and pulling the tiebreaker card pretty much ensured our victory. I forgot how fun this game was.

Frosthaven (at 3) - Now that we finished Gloomhaven digital and jaws of the lion digital, we began our trip into Frosthaven. It was a short trip though, as scenario 0 was a unneeded tutorial, and scenario 1 destroyed us with just about every enemy able to do lethal damage in one hit. Isaac Childres made a brilliant game, but if there's one thing I learned from Gloomhaven and Frosthaven, he cannot calibrate difficulty for early quests. We'll take another stab at it another time and hopefully actually enter Frosthaven.

That about does it. next meetup will be around my birthday time so I get the game choices of the weekend. I'm leaning towards a 4 person marathon play of Kings Dilemma, though some other ideas are starting up Oath or TI:4.

"I have been smashing my head against a wall for the last week trying to remember a game I played pre-pandemic, and I'm really hoping Reddit can help me with what it was called.

I remember there was a device in that had 4 columns where balls rolled down. I *think* the balls were Red, Yellow, Black, White (it's possible I am wrong on that). You would have cards that would require certain combinations of balls to ""make"", then they would be placed in front of you as inventions, gadgets, etc. 

A few cards were flipped over in the center, and you could take a certain amount and store them to build them later. Certain cards let you store more balls, certain cards let you draw balls, certain cards let you store more cards, etc. I remember that there were a good number of chain reactions that would take place later in the game.
